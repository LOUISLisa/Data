We\u2019re passionate, self-driven, industry leaders whose mission is to build a better, freer internet. We're also building the Cosmos Network, a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by classical BFT consensus algorithms like Tendermint Core. We believe the technology we're building will have a major impact on human beings around the world. We\u2019re well funded and growing quickly. How we work: Our teams leverage agile methodologies to move quickly and stay focused. Most of us work out of our offices in San Francisco, Berkeley, Toronto, and Berlin, but some of our employees work remotely. Communication is important to us and we rely heavily on Slack, Zoom, and GitHub to help us stay in sync. Everything we build is open source and available on GitHub. This is a full time position and can be located in either of our offices, or 100% remote.
