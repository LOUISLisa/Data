    "Body": "Documentation & Technical Content Strategist, Filecoin at Protocol Labs Protocol Labs is a research, development, and deployment institution for improving Internet technology. Protocol Labs leads groundbreaking internet projects, such as IPFS, the decentralized web protocol; Filecoin, a cryptocurrency incentivized storage network; and libp2p, a modular network stack for peer-to-peer apps and systems. Protocol Labs works openly, and is focused on the creation of value at a massive scale. Job Description We\u2019re looking for a versatile, creative technical writer and content strategist to help make the next version of the internet easier to build. As a documentation and technical content strategist, you will help set and steer the direction of documentation and other content during a crucial stage in the Filecoin Network\u2019s development: the ramp-up to main network launch and beyond. This role is both tactical and strategic, and you will be instrumental in Protocol Labs\u2019 efforts to plan, create, organize, and improve content for both technical and non-technical audiences. Day-to-day, you might update existing documentation for accuracy, draft or review documentation on new features, or create new material that makes Filecoin easier to understand and use. More strategically, you might design and build new documentation or educational resources, conduct research with the broader Filecoin community, or work closely with engineering teams to clarify fine details of our work. The Filecoin audience includes developers and end users with many perspectives, needs, and technical proficiencies. At this role's broadest level, you will ensure that the entire community has the knowledge and resources to use or build upon the Filecoin Network. We\u2019re looking for someone who has been in the technical weeds before; you either already understand blockchain or distributed systems, or have enough software development background and interest to dive in and get up to speed on this particular stack. We strongly believe that Filecoin has the potential to upgrade the internet, but we also realize that at this stage of the project\u2019s development, it is absolutely critical to translate our core implementations and specifications into approachable, human-friendly documentation, guides, explainers, and teaching aids. If you enjoy diving into code and distilling complex concepts into sentences, structures, and diagrams people understand, this job is for you. Responsibilities Lead technical content projects. Identify user and organizational needs through exercises such as formal interviews, informal conversations, analytics research, content audits, comparative analyses, contextual inquiry, or site-mapping. Plan and execute new content projects or significant upgrades, from start to finish. Maintain project management tools such as Github in ways that encourage community contributions and keep work visible and accountable. Deliver and maintain high-quality, user-centered technical content. Choose the best format(s) for the need: usage documentation, concept explainers, API documentation, example code, and more. Write, edit, and collaborate with everyone from core developers to new users and contributors. Review and provide feedback for content contributions to ensure language is clear, consistent, and technically correct. This is especially important because many of our users and contributors are not native English speakers. Create and maintain workflows to ensure that our technical content accurately reflects quickly evolving software. Implement tooling to generate, format, and test documentation You should be comfortable enough in code to be able to generate, format, test, and improve documentation-related websites such as github.com/filecoin-project/metadocs (which creates docs.filecoin.io). You don\u2019t need experience in 100% of these responsibilities, and we\u2019d like to hear about your unique perspective on this role. Tell us about what you can bring! You may be a fit for this role if you... Have demonstrated expertise leading content work with cross-functional, collaborative teams on time-sensitive projects Have a successful track record in creating documentation or other content to synthesize and simplify technical concepts for technical and non-technical audiences Understand the challenges of keeping documentation up to date with improvements in rapidly improving software, and how to write just enough documentation to be helpful (but not so much that the docs fall behind the project). Have a technical background and/or demonstrated fluency in distributed computing systems or other technical concepts relevant to our work Have strong written and verbal communication skills in both community-facing and internal settings Bonus points if you have... Experience working in or managing open-source communities Experience with developer relations or developer support Experience as a developer or researcher on complex technical topics What\u2019s it like to work at Protocol Labs? Protocol Labs mission is to improve humanity\u2019s most important technology, the Internet. We build protocols, systems, and tools to improve how it works. Today, we are focused on how we store, locate, and move information. Our projects include IPFS, Filecoin, libp2p, and more. As a distributed team, we hire anywhere in the world, and at various levels of experience (entry, senior, staff). We look for people with unique perspectives and diverse backgrounds. We have a great benefits package, including parental leave, contributions to your retirement, competitive pay, and unlimited time off. For U.S.-based employees, we also provide platinum-level health, dental, and vision coverage for you and your family.
