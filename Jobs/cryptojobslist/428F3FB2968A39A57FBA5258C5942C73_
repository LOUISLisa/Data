    "Body": "$PAC | People's Alternative Choice $PAC is a digital asset based off of DASH with a solid foundation and a bright future. $PAC is a unique hybrid that combines a master node network at its foundation complimented with a vibrant community. These two networks synergize together and provide a strong foundation for $PAC\u2019s future projects. The masternode network providers will engage the $PAC community to help steer 20% of the future coin supply on use cases focused on charity, content and alternative choices. We have just finished a successful redemption program with over 60,000 transactions where there were over three trillion old PAC, to the new coins called $PAC! The PAC to $PAC redemption window will be officially closing on June 30th, 2018, but we will keep a small pool of coins available to uphold our originally published schedule. Currently, there are approximately ~300 million $PAC available to be used to help fuel the core operations and provide an incentive structure for the future management team of $PAC. $PAC has a DAO system like DASH, but this system lacks the efficiency and transparency that a traditional operational budget needs to succeed and minimize wasteful expenses etc. For example, as the price fluctuates projects submitted to the existing DAO system become massively overpaid or underfunded. Early on the founding team identified these issues and decided to build an operational budget and incentive program from the remaining $PAC. This pool of $PAC will be released into circulation with the commencement of this budget and the treasury position. Finding the balance of decentralized system that competes in the digital asset space against centralized teams and operational personnel provides $PAC with significant challenges. We believe we have designed an excellent compromise that will make our community members and masternode holders satisfied. We actively invite applicants to apply for this role and help us succeed in achieving these goals. As our operations expand, we need our management team to grow so we can continue to deliver excellence across a harmonized business front. $PAC currently has a presence all across the world and it is currently ranked around 250 as a digital asset. Join our team and help us deliver an outstanding, customer-oriented and community focused treasury management service.
