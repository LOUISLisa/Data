    "Body": "Payment Integrity Manager at Eco At Eco we're challenging existing payment processing models, changing the way money moves for many segments of modern e-commerce. With every new partnership opportunity or product feature, we confront new issues related to payment compliance and liquidity management. Where we interface with cryptocurrency, many of these issues demand new solutions, working in best faith to satisfy legacy compliance frameworks. As our Payment Integrity Manager, you'll be essential in creating risk and compliance strategies that will enable us to launch and grow Eco products globally. You will support our product development efforts internally and also be a point of contact for many of our integration partners and early merchant customers. You will also need to be our resident expert on payment operations within relevant statutory frameworks. We're looking for someone with rigor and who takes ownership by default, with the conviction and creativity to help us build a new type of payment network. We hope it's you! Why this matters: Our everyday payment systems are dependent upon financial infrastructure design decades ago. Consumers benefit from rewards programs and new checkout experiences, but in the background money moves the same as ever: through insecure networks that impose unnecessary costs on all of us as they strain to meet the needs of modern commerce. We started Eco because we know that with the right product strategy, serving the right use cases, cryptocurrency and blockchain finally present a solution for many of our most persistent payment problems. It\u2019s possible to rethink our current payment systems from the ground up. In doing that, we confront several difficult, challenging and impactful problems which will demand solutions in order to build a trusted and ubiquitous payment system to enable commerce for everyone. To achieve our mission and realize our vision, we\u2019ve put together an incredible team and are selectively adding to it. Job Description What you'll do (outcomes) Manage all payment operations to address the company\u2019s payments compliance program and other regulatory requirements. Contribute to product development analysis to ensure we achieve the best possible user experience while satisfying all relevant compliance requirements. Monitor changes in industry regulations and modifies policies, procedures, and systems as necessary. Provide ongoing management guidance, training, and course correction to help us assess resources and monitor performance metrics. Work across multiple teams and projects to develop and implement scalable integrity systems and controls. Work with internal and external auditors to revise periodic risk assessments and remediate any issues identified. Maintain records and assist senior management in reporting to regulatory agencies and financial partners as required. What you'll bring (competencies) Strong knowledge of compliance regulations and significant experience managing a compliance function in the payments, fintech and/or banking industry. Knowledge of recent FATF and FINCEN decisions, guidance and policies related to cryptocurrency. Experience developing and independently managing effective compliance programs in a high-volume, low-touch environment. Experience directly interfacing with state and federal regulators. Hustle! Your record shows that you thrive amidst multi-tasking and are risk-tolerant amidst ambiguity. -- Please note that we are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, background, religion, gender identity, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship status, marital status or disability. Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records. If you have a disability or special need that requires accommodation, please feel free to let us know. Ã°\u009f\u0093\u008d San Francisco, CA "
