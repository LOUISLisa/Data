    "Body": "Software Engineer, Developer Experience at NEAR NEAR is a sharded, developer-friendly, proof-of-stake public blockchain, built by a world-class team that has built some of the world's only sharded databases at scale. Job Description We\u2019re building the baseline infrastructure of the new web but to be successful we need to cultivate an ecosystem of great applications. This means actively supporting the early developers and entrepreneurs who want to build on the protocol. And, of course, building new example applications, tooling and infrastructure they need to get started and grow. You\u2019ll be a good fit for this role if you have a wide-ranging full-stack skillset and a love of working with other developers. Some days will require problem solving and helping these developers build great apps while other days will involve creating new applications and tooling from scratch internally. To be successful, you will need to be comfortable working quickly at the web/mobile application layer down to the blockchain layer to help troubleshoot and smooth out the developer experience for our partner developers. This requires interacting with the scripting and markup that defines the apps, the TypeScript/AssemblyScript and Rust APIs for creating smart contracts and a bit of Rust to understand what\u2019s going on at the blockchain layer. Perhaps most importantly, you\u2019ll need to be comfortable communicating frequently with both our internal teams and external developers. You\u2019ll work closely with multiple different teams within Near -- Engineering, Developer Relations, Biz Dev and Community. Because you see so much of the ecosystem in this role, it\u2019s a great launching pad for going deeper in many possible directions, whether that means building your own applications, hacking on the core protocol or even joining one of the other teams who are building on top of the NEAR Platform. While energy and enthusiasm are key, this is a position for **well-experienced developers only**. We don\u2019t care what certifications you have or even if you went to school\u2026 but you absolutely need to be able to ship great code. ## Requirements: 5+ years building production-level applications and experiences in rapid iteration, high-quality environments like top tier startups and consultancies. Comfort operating across the full stack including front end web, mobile, back end, smart contracts and dev ops. ## Get to Know NEAR Near is building the infrastructure of the decentralized web, including the NEAR Protocol smart contract platform and a variety of supporting tools. NEAR is a scalable blockchain designed to provide the performance and user experience necessary to bridge the gap to mainstream adoption of decentralized applications. Unlike other next generation blockchains, this network has been built from the ground up to be the easiest in the world for both developers and their end users while still providing the scalability necessary to serve those users. ## Working at Near At Near, you have the chance to become an early member of a world-class team with significant upside. The opportunity we are tackling will completely reshape the landscape of the web for decades to come and potentially affect billions of people. We are funded by the top names in the industry and have attracted the best technical minds in the world to create a technology that will directly change the lives of billions of people. This is a performance culture where you\u2019ll be working alongside -- and learning from -- other top quality teammates executing at their best. We value boldness, ownership, transparency, curiosity and experimentation. We pay competitively plus we offer all employees full health benefits, daily lunch and a fully stocked office within walking distance of BART in SOMA. If you\u2019re excited by the challenge of winning in the fastest moving ecosystem as a member of its best team, this might be a good fit. ????????????????????????
