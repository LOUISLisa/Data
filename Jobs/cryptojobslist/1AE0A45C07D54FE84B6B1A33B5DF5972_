Job Description Build the reference implementation of a resilient, open, and upgradeable network for humanity\u2019s information. We are hiring senior software engineers/leaders to work on the reference implementation of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS is one of the most promising projects of Web 3.0. Combining distributed systems research with large-scale real-world application, IPFS has brought content-addressed, peer-to-peer applications to millions of monthly active users. If successful, IPFS will form a new foundation for a distributed web of knowledge and computation for humans everywhere -- Ã°\u009f\u008c\u008e - Ã°\u009f\u009a\u0080 - Ã°\u009f\u008c\u0096.
