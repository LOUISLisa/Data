    "Body": "MetalPay MetalPay is a payment app similar to Venmo, but instead of the boring old routine, you earn cryptocurrency when making payments. There are several ways to send money to your friends using apps. However, most of these applications have some major flaws: *High fees and predatory terms. (Cough, cough. Read the fine print) *Hard to use interfaces and design. *Uninsured funds. If the money in your account gets stolen, tough luck. We are shaping digital money by revolutionizing the way people transact money. Our founders were inspired to create a payment solution that rewards good spending behavior, unlike the popular predatory credit card rewards out there. *Cash in Metal Pay is FDIC insured. *Metal Pay is the first app to offer up to 5% back in rewards for every payment. *Can your bank say the same?
