It's based on decentralized technologies such as Ethereum and Tendermint blockchains and ZK-Snarks. All our code is released as free open-source and intended as a commons infrastructure. Our open stack makes uses of Golang, Flutter and web technologies (Typescript). We're looking for highly autonomous, idealists, that look for an effective change in how society is organized. Our team is mostly based around Catalonia/Barcelona, but we work remotely.
