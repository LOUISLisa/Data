Ethereum Classic is an independent community driven blockchain continued after EF (a foundation originally started Ethereum blockchain) moved to a separate fork by introducing censoring transactions into their blockchain. Ethereum Classic community opposed that fork and kept original chain, because it believes in principles of blockchain. We\u2019re maintaining and adding new features to the go-ethereum client (Geth). This is a reference implementation of Ethereum Classic protocol, written - you guessed it - in Go.
