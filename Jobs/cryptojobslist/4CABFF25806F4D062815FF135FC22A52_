We\u2019re building a market intelligence platform, and we cannot succeed without having world-class talent who can help us identify, refine, communicate, and prioritize our product vision. As a Product Owner at CoinFi, you\u2019ll be supported by colleagues who not only have extensive subject matter expertise in cryptocurrencies and trading, but who appreciate the value that Product Management brings to a product organization. You\u2019ll work closely with the cofounders to come up with the best product vision for CoinFi. Get in on the ground floor of an ambitious startup - we\u2019re on a mission to be the go-to resource in every crypto trader\u2019s workflow. By combining currently disparate toolchains into one unified platform, we\u2019ll be able to take advantage of the synergies between each product and deliver much more value to users than individual standalone solutions can at the moment. We have a serious war chest and a team with the right experience to execute on this vision. You\u2019d be one of the first pioneers to join us post token sale. Your mission (should you choose to accept) as Product Manager at CoinFi is to own the product and deliver business value to users efficiently with our available resources. We recognize the immense value a Product Manager brings to the team, and you\u2019ll quickly become the rock star of the organization as you help us identify, refine, communicate, prioritize, and execute our product vision.
