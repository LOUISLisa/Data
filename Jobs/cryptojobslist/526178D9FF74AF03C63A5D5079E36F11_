Even in the first-world-countries it is often challenging to buy cryptocurrencies. Various KYC and AML banking guidelines make it difficult for foreigners and even locals transfer their fiat currency to a fiat-to-crypto exchange. In some cases, you might actually have spare cash to buy this new digital currency with. You will surely think \u2014 so how do i get some Bitcoin or Ethereum? The answer is simple \u2014 work on a job that pays in crypto! At first, this may sound weird and shady\u2026 But it is not! Hundreds of legitimate companies of all sizes are emerging worldwide that are more than happy to accept and pay back their community in crypto. Today we are introducing a section of Crypto Jobs List that is fully dedicated to jobs that pay in cryptocurrency. Scroll through the list of jobs and find one for yourself. There is a range. And here are a few things you need to know: Different jobs pay in different cryptocurrency. Not all of them pay in Bitcoin. Some do, but not every single one. Some also pay in ETH (Ethereum), some in XMR (Monero) and other coins. Some, especially post-ICO companies, might be willing to pay in their tokens. Make sure to do your own due diligence on each company, their token and it\u2019s value. We\u2019d like to make sure you are aware of financial risks associated with high fluctuations in coin\u2019s value. Next: some jobs are location-based, some are remote. Majority is remote, and are a perfect opportunity for you to earn bitcoin online. Location-based, on-site jobs might be even more lucrative, however they might require higher skill-sets and relocation. Jobs that pay in crypto might be both technical and non-technical. If you are a developer, you are surely in high demand right now. If you are a non-technical crypto enthusiast \u2014 don\u2019t worry \u2014 there are plenty of opportunities for you too. Most popular non-technical jobs are copywriter, marketing and social media management, community management and a range of executive positions. Final words of advice: make sure to carefully read the requirements of your dream crypto job. Spend considerable time applying for each positions that fits your skill-set and dedicating at least 30 minutes to writing a great cover letter. Never copy-paste and reuse your cover letters for multiple companies. It is very easy to spot and will look bad on you. Hiring manager will throw your application in trash. Be persistent, patient and meticulous while applying. Good luck!
