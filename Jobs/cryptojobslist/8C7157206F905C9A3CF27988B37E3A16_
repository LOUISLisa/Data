    "Body": "Ã°\u009f\u0091\u008d Featured Job Opportunity DÃÂ©veloppeur Blockchain Junior at Nomadic Labs Nomadic Labs / Tezos protocol Born almost six years ago, the Tezos blockchain is a high-tech project whose many qualities are the direct result of French research. Tezos is a self-amending blockchain which allows companies and individuals to trade using its native XTZ crypto-currency. Built to evolve democratically and securely within a global community, Tezos provides an ideal long-term solution for digital transactions. Nomadic Labs is a research and development company whose main mission is to implement the Tezos protocol. The company now has a team of about 40 employees, most of whom are research engineers who hold a PhD in Computer Science. Nomadic Labs, whose mission is also to encourage the adoption of the Tezos technology in France, is looking to recruit a Junior Blockchain Developer to provide help and technical support to the ecosystem of companies using the Tezos technology. The ecosystem is made up of the following: DSC (Digital Service Companies): companies that develop IT projects using blockchain technology (including \u201csmart contracts\u201d). STO platforms: companies that \u201ctokenise\u201d assets (e.g. financial assets such as shares in companies or bonds, or real estate assets such as property). Major accounts: companies that are likely to adopt Tezos technology. Nomadic Labs and the Tezos ecosystem have chosen to focus primarily on the financial sector, such as banks and insurance companies, as they are more likely to invest in resources in this technology. In addition to providing direct support to the ecosystem of companies mentioned above, the role will include some technical support to the wider Tezos community in order to ensure success and adoption. Job Description Responsibilities The role of the Senior Blockchain Developer will be as follows (although this list is not exhaustive): To provide technical support to those developing projects on Tezos, in order to ensure the proper integration of decentralised applications on the Tezos protocol. To provide technical support to those already using the Tezos protocol for their projects. Generally, following an amendment to the Tezos chain, major accounts / startups will need to be informed that they need to update their infrastructure on Tezos. To organise any discussions and strategies necessary for the development of tools in order to ensure their proper adoption alongside others within the blockchain ecosystem. To develop those tools if necessary. To participate in technical support within a team of 5-10 people to help those mentioned above, and to support with the development of tools. To participate in the development of Open Source projects. To proactively support software developers in relation to payments and exchanges using XTZ tokens and wallets, as well as to provide support for payment methods and points of sale using XTZ. To carry out digital monitoring on tools, and to support tool developers (via libraries of interactions with the Tezos chain in different languages and for different platforms, indexers, etc.). To build a library of models and proofs of concept in order to build a portfolio that facilitates adoption. To be the link between core developers (especially Nomadic Labs) and tool and application developers. Blockchain is a futuristic technology which is still relatively new. Working in this field can be an extraordinary springboard, as there are still only a small number of professionals within the industry. It is quite likely that the expertise developed by the developer will be recognised and sought after within a year. Desirable qualities Engineering school or university background A good knowledge of Blockchain and a first experience of development in private / public blockchain Fluent French (DALF \u2013 C2) and English (TOEIC \u2013 900) Application (CV and cover letter) to be sent by email to Anne de la Salle, the person responsible for the first stage of this hiring process: adelasalle[at]fimeca.org Ã°\u009f\u0093\u008d Paris "
