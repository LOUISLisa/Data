We already power large CDN networks like cloudflare.com blocking bots on the internet. Did you know the HCaptcha network is powered by a decentralized blockchain solution on the testnet of ethereum? More users rely on HCaptcha than any other blockchain project in history. In many ways, https://github.com/hcaptcha/hmt-escrow is one of the largest crypto projects ever. We differ from other crypto projects in that we are not hype-driven. We are building real ML solutions already used by the largest companies in ML.ÃÂ  Job Description We need someone who's fluent in python, javascript, and everything having to do with Ethereum. You'll handle the open-source project and integrating it into our worldwide captcha infrastructure.ÃÂ  You'll also make sure our clients get paid HMT on time and without issue. The two ways of getting this job are either: - if, you have already done a few bounties on hmt-escrow, then just ask to be hired based on your good work on the PR. Paid work on a bounty counts towards our trust in your ability to deliver regularly.ÃÂ  - Apply directly https://angel.co/company/intuition-machines-1/jobs/807511-web-services-engineer-backend-security-or-devops-focus. Make sure to mention that you are applying for the crypto-focused position. We will want to see a substantial portfolio of work and it's much easier if you have already worked with us in Open Source.
