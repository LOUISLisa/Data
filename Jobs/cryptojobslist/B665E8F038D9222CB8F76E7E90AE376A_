    "Body": "Enigma Enigma is a blockchain-based protocol that uses groundbreaking privacy technologies to enable scalable end-to-end decentralized applications. With Enigma, \u201csmart contracts\u201d become \u201csecret contracts,\u201d where input data is kept hidden from nodes in the Enigma network that execute code. This functionality is essential for protecting sensitive data and creating truly decentralized solutions at scale. We are currently building libraries which will become building blocks of the Enigma protocol and will be leveraged by dApps which work with sensitive data inputs. We are looking for a blockchain enthusiast who has experience working with Solidity and building Ethereum smart contracts.
