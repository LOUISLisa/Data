    "Body": "Etherscan ð Hi, we are Etherscan \u2014 a Block Explorer and Analytics Platform for Ethereum, a decentralized smart contracts platform. The main feature of Etherscan involves crawling the Ethereum public distributed ledger for information on transactions, address, smart contracts, and statistics and displaying them to users in an intuitive and easy-to-understand manner. Website Twitter GitHub Active 4 months agoðï¸ 2023 views Company Culture Here at Etherscan, we value openness, togetherness, and growth. We have an open office that spans 2 workspaces. Workspace encourages the free flow of ideas and drives clear communication. So it\u2019s almost like a private coworking. We show up at the office and we can work from any place/room in this space. I think a good way to summarise our vibe is to say we are: \u201cLaid back but attentive\u201d. Again, that\u2019s because we are dealing with users internationally. ð²ð¾ Malaysia People are surprised that we are in Malaysia; a small country in Southeast Asia (we get great selection of food choices as the country is multi-racial). We always get that when we go to events, e.g. for DevCon and people always get ð± shocked when they hear that we are from Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur is a great, dynamic and laid back city in South East Asia. It\u2019s a less \u201ctense\u201d place, compared to Singapore, for example, haha. But still quite dynamic with plenty of nature, attractions, malls, bars and plenty of other entertainment opportunities. ð ï¸ Technology Stack ASP.NET, C#, VB.net, JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL, HTML/CSS, Responsive Design, JSON/XML, Git, REST, API. Check out our Open Source contributions: https://github.com/etherscan - And we are active on Ethereum focus gitter channel ð§ Work process Our productivity tools are pretty common: Slack, Zoom, Hangouts, Skype. We mostly work out of the office, so we don\u2019t deal with much communications overhead and complexity that some other remote teams might have. We do bi-weekly meeting that keeps the team informed and aligned. We also follow Sprints. What is a Sprint? \u2014 Sprint is like a \u201crush\u201d to get things done. It\u2019s like a deadline but slightly flexible. When we have a sprint we push everything together and discuss everything before the deadline, end goal is to launch before the deadline When someone says \u201cWe have a Sprint this coming Wednesday\u201d \u2014 this means that whatever that person and other team members have, we\u2019ll have to achieve that on that day and we\u2019ll push that praying hard live button. And everyone got to make sure it is bug-free at that moment. If you are wondering how Sprints compare to \u201cshipping\u201d or \u201cproduction day\u201d \u2014 sprints are a much shorter. \u201cProduction day\u201d sounds too formal, while Sprints are less formal. What\u2019s more all the cool startups are doing that! Most importantly shorter sprints keep the team highly motivated and more sense of Hooray! We don\u2019t have a fixed shipping schedule, so there is no particular time or day of the week where we schedule sprints for. Do you see any relationship between how busy Etherscan team gets and crypto price movements? There is certainly a correlation between market movements, price of ETH and how busy we are in the office. When there is a bull run, more activity on Ethereum chain \u2014 we\u2019d typically get a more support tickets and requests from developers than during bear market. However, we don\u2019t try to plan our workload around crypto market prices and hype levels. We stick to our own agenda and things that we want to achieve at Etherscan. We have things to get done all year round, regardless of whether the market is up or down. Drama or no drama, here we keep BUIDling regardless ð¤·\u200dâï¸ Office space We have a lot of fun stuff in the office. We have 2 workspaces. One of the workspaces is dedicated to meetings and it\u2019s designed in a fun way \u2014 we have table tennis in the center and arcade gaming console in a corner. Coffee machine â\u2014 so anyone who feels like it can act as a barista, lol. We\u2019ve got a lot of coffee gear here. Everyone gets handcrafted coffee now! There\u2019s even a dedicated space for VR - yippee we have received our Oculus Quest sets and can play multiplayer! Welcome to the party! ð. Oh not to mention we have swags ðð¥¤ We are free to work anywhere within the space. So if today anyone come to the office and feels like they would like to sit in a different office environment to get work done \u2014 they can go one of the units, sit down there and finish work. Or, on some day everyone is more chillaxed and everybody shows up at the common area \u2014 then everyone will go to the common area, have some discussion and hang. It\u2019s pretty fun. It\u2019s like a \u201ccoworking space\u201d, except that we own that \u201ccoworking space\u201d haha. We\u2019ve got bean bags, of course. The fridge is always full ð So that\u2019s cool. Whom are you hiring now? We are always looking for quality developers to join our team in Kuala Lumpur! So if you are already based in KL or open to relocation for this amazing team and opportunity \u2014 just pop up an email (jobs@etherscan.io) and we\u2019ll try to find you a fit.
