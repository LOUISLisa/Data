In the 21st century our freedom as individuals will no longer be dictated by geographical constraints, financial institutions, and ultimately lessen the tyranny of the birth lottery. Despite the technology being at such a nascent stage blockchain industry has seen unprecedented growth. In 2017 alone the industry grew by 3,100%. People call Bitcoin a bubble. The total market cap is currently worth $321 billion (as of 30/05/2018)1, which pales in comparison to the dotcom bubble which was worth $3 trillion, despite not having any new or existing technology backing the absurd total market value. While Bitcoin itself may not be the most valued asset in the world in the near future, it is undeniable that the applications of blockchain technology reach far further than for simple uses such as executing transactions. Blockchain technology will become a powerful mechanism for shaping the validity of identification, the creation of smart contracts and the way in which ownership is branded on assets such as property or money. However, many in the industry have been blinded by short termism and greed, unable to see the multi-trillion dollar value creation that will occur in the space. At Xalpha we aim to accelerate the creation of the next generation of blockchain protocols. As an investment fund in blockchain, our activities include: sourcing very early stage protocols with multi-billion dollar potential; developing quantitative & algorithmic trading strategies; and creating a blockchain ecosystem in Europe. Our day to day activity falls in to the 3 broad umbrellas of: -Eliminating and capitalising on market inefficiencies through quantitative strategies -Effectively allocating human & financial capital to the brightest entrepreneurs in world -Pioneering new standards & systems for market equity and transparency We are looking for a talented individual with demonstrable experience in programming to join us on this revolutionary journey in invigorating a new and people-empowering global society, catalysing only the most preeminent and absolute protocols in the world.
