In joining us, you'll take part in transforming the way that value is exchanged on a global scale. We're a highly technical, globally distributed team with headquarters in San Francisco, passionate about open-source software and decentralized technology's potential to act as an equalizing force in the world. Our technology is deployed by a wide array of projects at the cutting edge of internet and economic advancement. Job Description COMPANY At 0x Labs, our mission is to create a tokenized world where all value can flow freely. We're a highly technical, globally distributed group of teams working together toward actualizing that mission. In doing so, we're excited and proud to be pushing the envelope across the DeFi and Ethereum stacks. In joining us, you'll take part in transforming the way that value is exchanged on a global scale. We're passionate about open-source software and decentralized technology's potential to act as an equalizing force in the world, and our technology is deployed by a wide array of projects at the forefront of internet and economic advancement. Founded in 2017, 0x Labs created and now partakes in the development of 0x protocol: a network comprised of open-source infrastructure, tooling, and cryptocurrency-based incentives that allow for the decentralized exchange of any blockchain-based digital asset. 0x is a secure, publicly owned and governed, and upgradable standard that\u2019s abstracted away from application-layer developers and enables interoperability between blockchain-based applications. Alongside the core protocol, 0x Labs also builds and maintains a suite of network incentives, business resources, developer/trader tools (e.g., 0x API), and end-user products (e.g., Matcha). MATCHA Matcha is 0x Labs\u2019 first consumer-facing product. Built on top of 0x API, Matcha is a meticulously designed decentralized exchange that makes it safe and easy for anyone in the world to access crypto assets on the Ethereum blockchain. We provide users with the best prices by aggregating liquidity from all of the major decentralized exchanges and splitting/routing orders intelligently. By focusing on user experience and education, Matcha will onboard the next wave of users into the DeFi ecosystem. As a Front-End Engineer on the team, you\u2019ll take large and early part in building out this flagship product. You\u2019ll work closely alongside: Chris Kalani, 0x Labs\u2019 Director of Design. Before joining ZeroEx, he founded Wake, a design visibility company that was acquired by InVision in early 2018; and prior, was an early Product Designer at Facebook, where he helped develop Messenger, Graph Search, and Friend List; A small team of four (and growing) world-class front-end engineers and designers; and Various other teams and stakeholders across 0x Labs. Curious? Matcha is still in private beta, but we\u2019ve teamed up with Maker to give exclusive early access to a handful of individuals. Sign up through Dai's asset page.
