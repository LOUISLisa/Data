    "Body": "Horizon Sentinel Horizon Sentinel is a new community management firm with its' founders based in both Australia and India. H.S was formed early in 2018 to fill a void in the market for a modest priced, high quality community management all-in-one solution. At H.S we think outside of the box and we like to go that extra mile, which is why clients come to us. A lot of community management firms these days are nothing more than an overpriced - glorified welcoming service, which we\u2019re not about at all. If the communities we manage have hard hitting technical questions, we\u2019re not going to shy away or ignore them, we\u2019ll hit them head on and encourage that conversation to grow. H.S is built on a foundation of trust, teamwork, experience and plain old fashioned hard work. If this sounds like we\u2019re your kind of people then reach out to us today.
