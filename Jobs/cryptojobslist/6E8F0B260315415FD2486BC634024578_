Love this group. I wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else.\" \"I randomly searched for the best IBO fit for me, not having any clue how to find the right choice that would suit my needs. But when I randomly came across Backwoods Velocity, something about them just gave me a sense of them having a personal touch and feel for their associates. I gave them a try and have not regretted my decision since. I love working for Backwoods Velocity....has been the absolute best in giving guidance, information, time and attention, great communication through all of it, and just overall very caring.......gems and I would not recommend any other IBO before them!
