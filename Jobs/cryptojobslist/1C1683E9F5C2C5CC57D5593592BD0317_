    "Body": "Head of Research at Eco Job Description Eco is hiring a Head of Research to focus on problems related to cryptoeconomics, monetary economics, consumer psychology and mechanism design. You will influence the incentive structure within our payment network, design experiments to test mechanisms and onboard new users, develop mindshare within academic and blockchain communities, and represent the company in publications and public forums. You will work with high-profile economists who act as advisors to our company, and you will be our resident expert with respect to several fast-moving topics within the blockchain space. Beyond the ability to nerd out with us, we're looking for someone with rigor, humility, and conviction. We hope it's you! Why this matters: Our everyday payment systems are dependent upon financial infrastructure design decades ago. Consumers benefit from rewards programs and new checkout experiences, but in the background money moves the same as ever: through insecure networks that impose unnecessary costs on all of us as they strain to meet the needs of modern commerce. We started Eco because we know that with the right product strategy, serving the right use cases, cryptocurrency and blockchain finally present a solution for many of our most persistent payment problems. It\u2019s possible to rethink our current payment systems from the ground up. In doing that, we confront several difficult, challenging and impactful problems which will demand solutions in order to build a trusted and ubiquitous payment system to enable commerce for everyone. To achieve our mission and realize our vision, we\u2019ve put together an incredible team and are selectively adding to it. What you'll do (outcomes) Design and manage a live test economy for Eco! Provide thought leadership in growing Eco adoption: Publish blog content on a monthly basis, explaining and advocating for the Eco model. Produce simulations and valuation models for the sustainability and growth of Eco\u2019s economy. This involves risk modeling and stress testing. Inform and model distribution strategies for Eco partnerships and promotions. Work with Ryne to engage and recruit substantive contribution from our economic advisors. Contribute to the community! Work with partner projects to build mindshare. Represent Eco publicly at events, including technical and cryptoeconomic events and conferences. Remain current on relevant research impacting our proposal, and produce regular internal summaries of external research. What you'll bring (competencies) Academic and/or professional background in economics, in particular some combination of mechanism design, behavioral economics and monetary economics. Excellent writing skills for both academic and more general interest audiences. Ability to produce simulations and models through a number of relevant frameworks, including Excel, Monte Carlo, R/Python, etc. Deep interest in and understanding of the blockchain ecosystem. -- Please note that we are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, background, religion, gender identity, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship status, marital status or disability. Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records. If you have a disability or special need that requires accommodation, please feel free to let us know. Ã°\u009f\u0093\u008d San Francisco, CA "
