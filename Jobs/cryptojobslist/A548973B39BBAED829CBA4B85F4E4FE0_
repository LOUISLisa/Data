    "Body": "Action Coin The Action Coin Platform represents over 1 Million Action collectors and customers from more than 200 countries and territories. It is the basis of an incentive-driven rewards program with \u201cpoints\u201d that are rewarded in the form of a decentralized, blockchain-based digital asset known as Action (\u201cACTN\u201d). Action may be redeemed for member-only discounts on a growing list of products and services offered through our business network. We also have more than 100 Brand Ambassadors worldwide. Action may be used as the sole payment method for discount vouchers offered by our business affiliates. Action may also be combined with Bitcoin, or one of over over 20 top Altcoins (alternate Cryptocurrencies), to obtain discounts on a growing list of products and services. Please read our white paper for more detailed information about the project.
