    "Body": "Jiltoken SMART SOLUTIONS ARE AT THE CORE OF OUR MISSION. JIL TOKENS is a cryptocurrency that acts as fiat currency and can replace costly credit card processing fees. These enticing features will attract mainstream adoption of the J1 as a competitive payment solution. A key factor of any cryptocurrency is its utility. If you cannot use it for something, such as investments or payments, then it will have no perceived value. In the case of the J1, it is useful as a payment solution thus its utility is high. In addition to the obvious utility of the J1, it adds the highly sought after liquidity to the world of cryptocurrency. According to Investopedia, \u201cliquidity describes the degree to which an asset or security can be quickly bought or sold in the market without affecting the price of the asset.\u201d Following that definition and according to some market watchers, they would conclude there are no liquid cryptocurrencies in the market at all. UNTIL NOW. THAT\u2019S THE VERY DEFINITION OF THE J1! The J1 is therefore an important game changer for users, merchants, and for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. We are the crypto currency of the future!
