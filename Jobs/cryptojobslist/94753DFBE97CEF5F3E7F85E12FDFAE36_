We offer a consolidated, regulated API for advanced order execution, and real-time market data that's used by some of the largest and highest performing quantitative traders in the digital currency space. Our API leverages partner settlement networks enabling fast and performant order execution that can happen partly or entirely from cold-storage. We work with quantitative funds and asset managers to improve their trade execution, market impact, and reduce development cost. While that might sound complex, rest assured: we don't take ourselves too seriously. Come join a culture that's focused on growth: of ourselves as people, on our expanding customer base, and our burgeoning snack budget. We take pride in our ability to find smart, humble people with the passion and drive to build something magnificent, together. Job Description High level summary: We\u2019re looking for seasoned engineers skilled with building distributed systems, integrating off-the-shelf libraries, and ensuring code quality standards are met. You will be instrumental in taking high level design documents and implementing them into a codebase; while ensuring that development follows best-practices. What you\u2019ll be doing. Drive ambitious technical projects that immediately impact our customers. Creating long-running jobs for streaming market data, normalizing across tens of venues, and ensuring its accuracy and consistency, and ultimately store it in a data warehouse. Read more here! Creating a system to handle order submission and tracking on exchange venues. This involves having a persistent job that is capable of sending orders to venues based on signals in the market/parameters of the algorithm. This also involves ensuring that we have a local replica of the information provided on exchange venues (balances, order history, pricings, etc.) Work with the talented, ambitious, and creative members of our engineering team. You'll be collaborating with our highly-motivated (and insatiably curious) engineers who bring with them rigorous and diverse industry experience, while also enjoying full access to our advisors, whose prolific careers at some of the world\u2019s premier tech organizations have cemented them as invaluable resources to FPG. Learn and grow at a breakneck pace as our company rapidly scales. As an early team member, you will have an incredible degree of autonomy, it's something we intentionally build into our workflow. We expect that you not only take ownership of your work but that you have an appetite for doing so. As our product and team continue to grow, your responsibilities will inevitably follow suit - the organization is expected to double in size in the next three months. Who you are. You\u2019ve designed and implemented complex distributed systems. You have extensive experience with microservice architectures. You excel at assessing the strengths and limitations of various implementations. You have a keen intuition for seeing how a product requirement might necessitate a particular technology, an conversely, how a technology in our stack might constrain the functionality of our product. You\u2019ve worked on a high-velocity product team. You understand how to build systems that enable fast product iteration. You\u2019re comfortable weighing trade-offs between functionality, quality, and technical debt. (You may have been an early engineer/technical cofounder at an early-stage company.) You can recognize and advocate for technical excellence. You strive to be a world-class engineer. You understand the discipline and craft of software development, you invest in learning and tooling, and you insist on technical excellence from yourself and your teammates. More about Floating Point Group. Our Team: We are technologists and we are builders. We spent years of ours lives building some of the most frontier computer science systems. We've designed, built, and deployed distributed data capturing systems at Jet, natural language processing models at MIT, and data pipelines for cancer cell analysis. Many of us have founded businesses previously. We founded FPG with a single goal: to improve the digital asset financial ecosystem. But, more importantly, to enjoy every minute of building a company, creating a culture, and shipping a product. We are the FPG family, and we would love to meet you. Our investors & advisors: We\u2019ve raised funding from well-known financial groups, venture capitalists, and an incredible group of veteran angels including AngelList's Naval Ravikant, Algorand's Steve Kokinos as well as publicly traded company founders.
