    "Body": "Software Engineer, Distributed Systems at Protocol Labs Protocol Labs is a research, development, and deployment institution for improving Internet technology. Protocol Labs leads groundbreaking internet projects, such as IPFS, the decentralized web protocol; Filecoin, a cryptocurrency incentivized storage network; and libp2p, a modular network stack for peer-to-peer apps and systems. Protocol Labs works openly, and is focused on the creation of value at a massive scale. Job Description Define and build elegant, performant, and resilient systems for tomorrow's web. We are hiring Distributed Systems Engineers to work on the JavaScript and Go implementations of protocols like IPFS, Filecoin and libp2p.

We are building that infrastructure. To continue that work, we're looking for people who thoroughly understand the principles of distributed systems and who will lean into the challenges of applying those principles in open-source code that will be deployed worldwide. Distributed Systems Engineering at Protocol Labs Distributed systems engineering lies at the center of many projects at Protocol Labs. With IPFS, libp2p, Filecoin and other related projects we are laying the foundation for a more resilient, more secure, distributed version of the web. This requires rigorous engineering from protocol design through all the phases of implementation.
