    "Body": "Research Scientist, Networking at Protocol Labs Protocol Labs is a research, development, and deployment institution for improving Internet technology. Protocol Labs leads groundbreaking internet projects, such as IPFS, the decentralized web protocol; Filecoin, a cryptocurrency incentivized storage network; and libp2p, a modular network stack for peer-to-peer apps and systems. Protocol Labs works openly, and is focused on the creation of value at a massive scale. Job Description Seeking an experienced networking researcher to help us design and implement systems that rethink and improve various levels of the modern networking stack. Research at Protocol Labs This isn't an ordinary Research Scientist position. Your expertise is mostly driven by both a hunger to learn and a need to work toward solving important problems. Our research scientists are granted both the freedom to develop their knowledge by working on novel applications, and a responsibility to contribute those skills toward advancing the flagship projects of Protocol Labs. You\u2019ll feel at home working with us if your knowledge and optimism enables you to name a few unusual possible approaches when you\u2019re first presented with a problem that people often consider intractable. We understand that networks are more than the sum of their parts. We built libp2p because we thought IPFS should include a better way of sending data between peers. Now we\u2019re improving our libraries and expanding the scope. As Filecoin launches and grows, we seek a specialist who can help make the networking stack that it relies on as efficient, robust, and secure as possible. As Research Scientist at Protocol Labs you will\u2026 Participate in cutting-edge research in computer networking. Develop novel systems and protocols; study and learn from existing ones. Study potential improvements or new parts of systems like IPFS, libp2p, and Filecoin. Work with the development team on turning the research into implementations. Quantify performance, security, and other properties of existing and proposed systems; suggest improvements based on the data. You may be a fit for this role if you have... MS or PhD degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related field, or equivalent practical experience. Ability to analyze, criticize, and improve the design of complex computer network systems Programming experience and proficiency in one or more of the following: Go, Rust, JavaScript, C, C++, Haskell, OCaml, Python, Clojure. Experience contributing to research communities and/or efforts, including publishing papers at conferences. Excellent written and verbal communication skills. Bonus points You have a record of demonstrating state-of-the-art innovation in networking with a proven publication record or project history. Potentially including but not limited to network optimization and graph traversals,, interdependent networks and robustness, and dynamic network analysis. You\u2019re comfortable digging through new academic literature on graph theory or IETF RFPs for inspiration while problem-solving. You believe that if you can\u2019t explain something to a six-year-old, then you don\u2019t understand it yourself, and your experience mentoring or writing technical explainers or blog posts demonstrates that you enjoy testing your understanding against this metric. You\u2019ve demonstrated the ability to design and execute on research agenda. You have experience setting up or managing research collaborations or contractors. You\u2019ve sent \u201cSYN\u201d as a text message to that friend who\u2019s notoriously bad at getting back to you. What\u2019s it like to work at Protocol Labs? Protocol Labs mission is to improve humanity\u2019s most important technology, the Internet. We build protocols, systems, and tools to improve how it works. Today, we are focused on how we store, locate, and move information. Our projects include IPFS, Filecoin, libp2p, and more. As a distributed team, we hire anywhere in the world, and at various levels of experience (entry, senior, staff). We look for people with unique perspectives and diverse backgrounds. We have a great benefits package, including parental leave, contributions to your retirement, competitive pay, and unlimited time off. For U.S.-based employees, we also provide platinum-level health, dental, and vision coverage for you and your family. Apply for this job Ã°\u009f\u0093\u008d Remote Ã°\u009f\u008c\u008e Remote "
