Members currently pay their Subscriptions via Paypal. Job Description Smart Contract Developer Programmer I seek to collaborate with an experienced programmer/developer, to provide the following services. I want to introduce a Smart Contract System, where all monthly and fortnightly subscriptions, are automatically paid via an Ethereum based Smart Contract. The Smart Contract also needs designing, in a way to automatically pay commissions from each subscription to upline members, as the compensation plan is based on a referral basis, where uplines receive frontline and downline commissions. The existing Compensation Plan is very simple and a Smart Contract system, will enable complete automation of commissions etc. Ã°\u009f\u0093\u008d Remote Ã°\u009f\u008c\u008e Remote Ã°\u009f\u0092Â° To be determined "
