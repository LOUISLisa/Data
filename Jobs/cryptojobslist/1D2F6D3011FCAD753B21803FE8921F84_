    "Body": "Product Marketing Manager at NEAR NEAR is a sharded, developer-friendly, proof-of-stake public blockchain, built by a world-class team that has built some of the world's only sharded databases at scale. Job Description Are you an experienced and hands-on product marketer who speaks developer and can perform product launches in your sleep? Are you passionate about growing ecosystems that support entrepreneurship on the back of audaciously innovative technology? As the Product Marketing Manager with NEAR, you will own the process of bringing this new development platform to market to the developers and entrepreneurs who will benefit most from its use. This means turning abstract benefits into concrete examples and doing whatever it takes to leverage them to grow awareness and adoption among NEAR\u2019s core technical audience. As NEAR goes to market and beyond, there will be dozens of launches to manage for new products and distribution efforts but the real focus is on making sure our core builders understand -- and use -- the platform and its tooling. You aren\u2019t on your own here! You will work closely with the Developer Relations, Product and Marketing teams along the way. To be successful, you will need the ability to translate technical concepts into concrete content and example application ideas while building the systems that are necessary to support an ongoing series of successful launches. This is not a position for anyone who is new to the field, has optimized a career for executing a single channel, who prefers to strategize rather than execute or who is uncomfortable being challenged every day. On the other hand, if you become your best self when you\u2019re given a set of difficult mission objectives but an empty canvas on which to paint your way to them, this might be a fit for you. Key Outcomes: NEAR\u2019s core launches achieve substantial early and ongoing uptake among deeply technical users, especially developers who will build on top of the platform. Requirements: 4+ years as a marketer, product manager, product marketer and/or founder in highly technical developer-facing startup environments. The ideal candidate has clearly bridged product and marketing before as a key member of top-tier teams in high growth technical startups. Extraordinary intelligence, problem solving ability, initiative and grit. Relentless resourcefulness paired with a \u201cget shit done\u201d mentality. Deep understanding of both product and marketing fundamentals as they are applied to startups and a ravenous thirst for knowledge. Get to Know NEAR NEAR is a scalable blockchain and smart contract platform designed to provide the performance and user experience necessary to bridge the gap to mainstream adoption and the scale sufficient to meet that adoption well beyond a billion users. Unlike other next generation blockchains, NEAR provides app builders with a seamless development experience and new ways of monetizing their applications. Working at NEAR At NEAR, you have the chance to become an early member of a world-class team with significant upside. The opportunity we are tackling will completely reshape the landscape of the web for decades to come and potentially affect billions of people. We are funded by the top names in the industry and have attracted the best technical minds in the world. This is a performance culture where you\u2019ll be working alongside -- and learning from -- other top quality teammates executing at their best. We value boldness, ownership, transparency, curiosity and experimentation. We offer all employees competitive salary and benefits plus a fully stocked office within walking distance of BART in SOMA. If you\u2019re excited by the challenge of winning in the fastest moving ecosystem as a member of its best team, this might be a good fit. Ã°\u009f\u0093\u008d San Francisco "
