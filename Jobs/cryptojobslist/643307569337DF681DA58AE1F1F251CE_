The platform is developed with the purpose of bringing more mainstream users, commercial and non-commercial, to start using blockchain technology. iOlite tokens will be used to compensate contributors in the iOlite network that help with the machine-learning process: each text parsing suggestion that is accepted by the iOlite Fast Adaptation Engine (FAE), will be compensated with iLT tokens. In addition, authors will be able to share their smart contracts with other iOlite ecosystem members, for fees in iLT tokens.
