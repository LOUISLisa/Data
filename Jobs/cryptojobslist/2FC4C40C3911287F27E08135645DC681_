    "Body": "TokenTax TokenTax is connecting the new financial world to the old one. We're starting by helping people file their taxes TokenTax is the simplest and most user-friendly crypto tax tool on the market. It works in three steps: Import your transaction data from every exchange Token Tax calculates your tax liability using a variety of algorithms and displays it in a clean interface Export a filled-out 8949 form which can be sent directly to the IRS or your accountant for review. Our competitors like Bitcoin.tax and Libra Tax overload their customers with every detail of the process instead of prioritizing what matters most to crypto users. Their user flows are not designed from first UI principles and lack understanding of the specific user task. We built this solution because it was the simplest way to fulfill our users\u2019 primary goal of understanding their tax liability and filing the required forms. We achieve this by providing users with a linear flow and appropriate messaging throughout the journey.
