    "Body": "Mobile technical lead at Tari Labs Job Description Tari leverages blockchain technology to re-imagine the future of digital assets. Our mission is to make it ridiculously easy for anyone to issue, manage, and transfer experience-linked assets like concert tickets, airline miles, or in-game purchases. All without middlemen or walled gardens. To accomplish this goal, we\u2019re building a new highly scalable, open-source, and decentralized blockchain on top of Monero, one of the most secure cryptocurrencies. Our founding team includes well-known leaders from the worlds of entertainment and blockchain, including: the co-founder of Ticketfly (sold to Pandora for $450m), the lead maintainer of Monero (a top ten, $2bn+ market cap cryptocurrency), and the leader of the digital agency behind stars like Carrie Underwood and Lil Wayne. Are you passionate about bringing blockchain to the masses? Do you want to help build open source software that millions of people will use? Are you excited to implement cutting edge blockchain technologies like Mimblewimble and Lightning Network? Do you check your ego at the door and fight for the best idea regardless of where it came from? If so, then we look forward to hearing from you. As the Head of Mobile Development, you will manage a remote and diverse team across several time zones and countries. You will be working with Heads of Design, Engineering and Platform and will be responsible for ensuring that projects are shipped on time to world-class standards of reliability, performance and user experience. About you: 8+ years experience as a mobile software engineer. 3+ years experience in both Android and iOS. 3+ years experience in working in and/or managing remote teams. Experience contributing to open-source projects is a major advantage. Experience in ReactNative is an advantage. Proven experience of delivering high-quality mobile applications, either alone or as a leading member of a team. Completely familiar with the publishing process on both the Google Play store and Apple App store. Comfortable with Github, Git, and agile development processes. Ability to multi-task and manage multiple projects simultaneously. Excellent written and verbal communication skills. You will be required to write news articles, blog posts or present talks at local and international conferences highlighting the exciting features and progress of the products. A degree in Computer Science from a recognized university is an advantage, but not a prerequisite. Apply for this job Ã°\u009f\u0093\u008d Johannesburg, South Africa "
