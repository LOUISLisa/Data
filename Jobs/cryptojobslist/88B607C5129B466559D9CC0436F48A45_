    "Body": "PolySign We're a very early stage startup founded by the Ripple founders, and looking for talented backend engineers to help us solve the biggest problem in crypto today: security and custody. We offer both the benefits of a larger company (401k, flexible working hours, salary, benefits) combined with the upside of getting in on the ground floor of a very early stage startup founded by folks that have done it before. PolySign was founded by Arthur Britto (founder of Ripple), with help from David Schwartz (Chief Cryptographer of Ripple). They have architected a solution that is a step function above what's currently available on the market today - would love to tell you more about it if you're interested.
