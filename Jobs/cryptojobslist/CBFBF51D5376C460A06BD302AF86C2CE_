    "Body": "Tusk Philanthropies Tusk Philanthropies is focused on two things: making sure people who are hungry have enough food to eat and fixing our democracy by making it exponentially easier to vote. One is a problem we tackle short-term every year by running legislation in states to expand funding for programs like school breakfast. The other is a very long term initiative to allow people to vote in elections on their phones (via blockchain). We all know our government and democracy is fundamentally broken. We believe the only way to fix it is by making sure politicians have to represent all voters and not just the handful who currently vote in primaries or donate money. Btw, we know that there are thousands of worthy causes out there that merit support. These happen to be ours.
