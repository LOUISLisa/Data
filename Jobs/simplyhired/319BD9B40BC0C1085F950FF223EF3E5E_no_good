Very Busy all day long typically working 10 plus hours. Multi tasking and hard deadlines on a daily basis provide a very fun competitive work load each day. ProsGood Benefits and meet great people ConsResponsibilities and pay compensation don't always match up 1.0 Driver | Springfield, MO | Nov 15, 2014 They will use, abuse, and spit you out. I came from an office position looking for some freedom. What I got was my cdl (the only good thing), and a lot of bad memories. The experience with their trainers was horrible. These guys just use you to double their driving clock. They are selfish, unclean, and overall are horrible to deal with. Once I was in my own truck, as a company driver, they abused me daily. They only want you to lease so you take on the risk and they get all the money. I have heard tons of stories of no time off at all and still Going broke. Prime loves it's office workers at the terminal, but drivers (who make the money for everyone) are 2 nd class citizens at best. ( in one of the safety meetings the drivers were actually referred to as grunts of the company if you can believe it.....) As for me, I got some experience and got out. I am driving local now home nights and weekends, working for a `real` company. I am making MORE money and am much happier having a normal life. Prime just wants all thAt government grant money. If you are destitute, they will get you into a truck, but this company does not care about you. If you work hard and get your cdl and some experience, you can move on quickly to a reputable company. Would I do it over? Not on your life. It was a horrible experience. I wanted to quit every day I had to spend with the horrible trainers. On my own the experience was better, but living on the road for weeks sucks, especially when there is no appreciation for your efforts. ProsThey will front all expenses and help you get your cdl.nice trucks that are well maintained. ConsThe trainers are disgusting, you will pay back all expenses once you are up and running. no home time, no respect. you will go broke if you lease and take. any time off. 5.0 Truck Driver Trainer | Springfield, MO | Jul 9, 2020 Excellent company to work for! Prime has one of the best CDL training programs, prime invest a great deal in turning out excellent drivers. I got my CDL through them, and after a few years of experience I decided to become a trainer as well. I\u2019ve been with the company for over 6 years, and I enjoyed my experience with the company so far. 1.0 Maintenance Coordinator | Springfield, MO | Oct 4, 2017 I loved my job, but.... I prefer to not get to deep into my issue with this employer. Prime, Inc could be an amazing company to work for if it weren't for the politics. I understand that's part of any career, to an extent, but nothing like this. 5.0 Independent Contractor (Trucking Industry) | Springfield, MO | Oct 31, 2018 experiencia en transporte Esta empresa, me dio la oportunidad de hacer algo diferente en el ambito del transporte pesado, el cual forma parte importante de mi experiencia laboral. 5.0 Transport Manager | Springfield, MO | Sep 13, 2012 Productive great place to work Developed creative solutions to difficult and time-sensitive problems that, if not solved, would lead to unacceptable customer satisfaction. Effectively trained incoming personnel on the basics and advanced requirements of customer service, brokerage, and profit earnings. 5.0 Switchboard Operator | Springfield, MO | Aug 2, 2019 Wonderful Company to work for. Prime Inc is an amazing company to work for. Great benifits and pay. They have hard hours and expect hard work, but you get paid for what you do so it makes it worth it. They strive for healthy employees by encouraging exercise and healthy eating. They want you to succeed and achieve your career goals and will help as well as they can. ProsGreat benifits ConsHard hours 4.0 Transportation Specialist | Driver, AR | Dec 20, 2014 great company if you know how to work hard prime inc is a wonderful company to work for. 5.0 Driver (Independent Contractor) | Springfield, MO | Jan 30, 2019 Prime Inc cares for the safety of their drivers and it is seen in all the safety training courses and videos available to the drivers. Great and awesome company to work for. The atmosphere at Prime terminals is always positive. The repair shops are amazingly clean and well kept. The repair technicians are. Very knowledgeable and have always had a positive and professional attitudes. The attention to details never ceases to amaze me. I truly love working for Prime Inc. ProsVery safety oriented company, provides all types of safety training associated with trucking. ConsYour financial success is in the hands of a fleet manager who depends on sales reps 2.0 Driver (Independent Contractor) | Springfield, MO | Feb 23, 2018 Driver managers are condescending and non-transparent morale killers. As an owner/operator with Prime Inc., I made more money than I would've as a company driver. However, it wasn't until I had a foot out the door that I came across a dispatcher who I had a mutually respectful relationship with. Trucking can be dangerous and my first two dispatchers were routinely disrespectful, passive aggressive, and condescending from the safety of an office environment. These dispatchers had a dictatorial attitude as if I were a company driver. My first dispatcher at Prime routinely ignored my days off requests despite receiving notice weeks in advance. These same dispatchers would give the \"encouraging communication\" speech, but when I would call to see why I'd been sitting idle for more than a day I received a reply of \"Can't you see I'm busy?\" despite being 1800 miles from where the dispatcher was sitting. After firing the my second dispatcher, Prime's day ops supervisor called me suggesting that it was bad that I had been through 2 dispatchers in 16 months. As if finally standing up for myself and demanding some respect and trust in my relationship with my dispatcher was too much to ask. This, despite the fact that I incurred almost all liability (physical safety,freight, etc.). My third and final dispatcher at Prime Inc., (Cole) was ideal. Freight didn't change,but the respect (lack of passive-aggressive condescension, and sarcasm) and open communication made me feel appreciated, as well as an independent contractor responsible for my own bott...more ProsYou can make good money at Prime ConsI felt like a truck number as opposed to a human being Questions And Answers about Prime Inc What would you suggest Prime Inc management do to prevent others from leaving? Asked Mar 20, 2017 Not give the fleet manager so much power over lease purchase revenue. Answered May 27, 2019 Structured training. The training program is sort of free form for trainers without the usual checklists and signoff you see at most large companies. Driving a truck might be an art form. But I've played the violin since I was 8 and I can easily tell you that art has science and structure. Office support isn't that great. It might be nice to see some automation support to minimize hassles from office staff, maybe like an uber system but lighter. Don't like the \"i should know that\" attitude from my support team. If i should know, you should tell me. Every time I ask, even if I ask 100 times. Even if I ask every day. Would rather have automation support. Not people. If you can automate the lawn being mowed you can automate my call in stuff. Automate. Automate. Automate. Answered May 20, 2019 What type of drug test is used at prime? Hair follicle or urine? Asked Apr 14, 2017 As of October 2019 it is urine before you start orientation and hair on day two of orientation. Answered Oct 10, 2019 We comply with the medical requirements and standards set by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to ensure that all of our truck operators conduct themselves as safely as possible. Each new driver must take a drug test and thorough physical exam that meets or exceeds these standards. You are required by law to disclose all treatment, medications and medical information with the doctor that is conducting your DOT physical. Some basic requirements are: Blood Pressure Levels: 140 over 90 or lower Eyesight: 20/40 or better in each eye (with corrective lenses if needed) Hearing: Must be able to hear a forced whisper at 6 feet Diabetic: Sugar levels must be well controlled with an A1c level of 10 or less. If you\u2019re on insulin, you will need form MCSA-5870 which can be found on the FMCSA website. Heart Related Issues: You will need cardiology clearance and possibly recent stress test or echocardiogram results. This list is not exhaustive of every disqualifying medical condition, medication or treatment. Please discuss your concerns with your primary care physician before you arrive at Prime. You can also give Recruiting a call to discuss any questions regarding drug testing! Answered Jul 29, 2019 What is the interview process like at Prime Inc? Asked Sep 4, 2016 The background check is completed during the intake process at their facility, which is a little unnerving. You sacrifice your job and get your family excited about an uncertain future. They are not sensitive to disability confidentiality and other candidates will hear your disability status. The DOT has a different rule about disclosure than OSHA, I guess. The week long orientation process is a mix of interview and orientation. It's adifficult and a high pressure process. The interview with the recruiter is a piece of cake, but you definitely aren't done there. Answered May 20, 2019 They say at prime, this is your longest interview, you will do a week of orientation, take a written test, get a physical, when you get there, then three weeks with a psd trainer, test out for your cdl, and you are hired. Answered Aug 22, 2018 Do prime take money out your check to pay the for school. Asked Feb 19, 2017 You get an advance during training which you pay back. You also have equipment costs which isn't revealed up front, even as a company driver. You have to pay for a TWIC card which is deducted from your paycheck. Your chains and load locks, ablon locks and such are expenses you are responsible for and required to have. These things will be deducted from your paycheck. They have a company store and you can purchase additional gear for the truck which can be deducted also. Answered May 20, 2019 Training is not \"free.\" You will pay for it one way or another. Answered Feb 1, 2019 Does prime do hair follicle or urine tests? Asked Mar 27, 2017 Sept. 30, 2017 Urine tests only as of this date. Answered Sep 30, 2017 They do only urine tests.
