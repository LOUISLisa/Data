Advancement is based on your relationship to a tribal leader and Americans don't have that. Pay for Americans is very good and it better be because that is the only good thing about the job.

Questions And Answers about Saudi Aramco What is the work environment and culture like at Saudi Aramco? Asked Sep 28, 2016 Task based with no vision, goal, or planning. Work on one emergency today, drop it and work on the next one tomorrow. No accomplishment or sense of achievement at all and nothing that you do really means anything or comes to fruition. It\u2019s drive to work, spend your day doing meaningless task, wash, rinse, repeat. It was miserable. After awhile the money did not matter and we packed and left. Answered Aug 18, 2018 Stressful and unpredictable........more than normal. Answered Sep 7, 2017 What is the most stressful part about working at Saudi Aramco?
