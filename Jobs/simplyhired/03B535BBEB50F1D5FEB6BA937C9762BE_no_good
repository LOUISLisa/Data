There have been periods of huge growth and the company is attempting to take it to the next level while buckling down on core scrum values. 1.0 Senior Administrator | Lakewood, NJ | Dec 6, 2017 Work Culture was difficult I think that Achieve3000 could be a good workplace if you are a part of their particular culture. There were many wonderful and talented people that worked there but it was not the work culture that I was looking for. ProsWork From Home, Ability to work independently ConsCulture was strict due to extremely conservative religious beliefs 5.0 Curriculum Manager | Dakota, MN | Mar 21, 2020 Assisting At Risk Students Through Differentiation Outstanding programing for providing literacy development through differentiation. Achieve3000 aligns content, instructional practices and supplemental materials while developing literacy across all developmental levels. 4.0 Curriculum Manager | Remote | Oct 9, 2019 Great Product The people work hard, and the product is great. Work/life balance can be tough, especially during back-to-school months. Not a lot of room for upward growth if you'd like to move up within the company. 5.0 Customer Service Representative | Lakewood, NJ | Mar 10, 2020 Great I honestly loved it there. Only left because it was a temp job. It\u2019s a lot in the beginning but once you figure out the programs it\u2019s a piece of cake. You get to work 2-3 days a week from home which is fantastic. ProsWork from home ConsLots of programs to learn 4.0 Service Manager | Remote | Apr 26, 2020 Productive Environment with room for advancement Worked closely with schools in my community to provide support and professional development regarding purchased digital learning platform. I was provided 1-2 office days a week and the rest of the time was spent working on school campuses Prek-12. 5.0 Quality Assurance Manager | Remote | Mar 23, 2020 Great company, very goal oriented I loved my 13 years in Achieve! They are very goal oriented towards helping kids. I didn't meet one person who was not on board with this! Really proud of my time there. Would be perfect if their administrative structure had more opportunities for advancement or a performance bonus/stocks recognition program. A lot of years went by only with the minimum, mandated COLA adjustment - very disappointing. And also, why have a 5 point evaluation system when nobody gets the top rating? Again, a truly awesome company with a few flukes, but overall, a great place to work from the heart. 2.0 Implementation Specialist | Lakewood, NJ | Oct 3, 2013 Eh No room for growth; micromanagement all around; raises are rare and never generous; appear to be flexible with schedules but really are not; best perk is a lot of vacation time. 1.0 Specialist | Lakewood, NJ | Nov 24, 2016 Horrible Management- Favortism based on religion. - Dysfunctional CEO Worst company I ever worked for! The CEO needs to MICROMANAGE EVERYTHING! On top of that she has zero respect for anyone, but those in her own religion! She has no problem screaming at employees, belittling them & treating people horribly. Constantly setting up meetings with customers & cancelling last minute. Management there can't do ANYTHING without approval by the Owner/CEO! How about having a little faith in your employees!? Its truly dysfunctional While I worked there I watched atleast 1 person get fired a week! No verbal or written warnings! If you work here have a backup plan. You say the wrong thing or get the CEO upset over ANYTHING, the next week you'll be out! This company needs to be held accountable for their awful treatment of employees! Should be illegal to treat people the way they do ProsDecent pay ConsDysfunctional CEO, Micromanagement, Favortism based on Religion Questions And Answers about Achieve3000 How do you feel about the future of Achieve3000?
