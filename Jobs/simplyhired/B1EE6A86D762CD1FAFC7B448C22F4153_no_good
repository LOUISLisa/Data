You will spend your day mostly scheduling and rescheduling calls and meetings, unless that's your calling in life prepare to be unchallenged. The people you support will vary from nice busy folks who genuinely appreciate what you do for them to prima donnas who enjoy blaming other people when they drop the ball. Your coworkers are mostly nice, the screening process weeds out most of the people who aren't sharp enough for the job but the lack of management presence means the younger EAs are free to roam around socializing at their whim, so sometimes the person you really need to speak with is at her friend's desk shopping online while you're trying to set up a call with an unhappy client. Managers (team leads) seem to be chosen more for how much their coworkers like them than for leadership abilities. Some of them are helpful and knowledgeable IF you can find them, for upper management seems to schedule frequent \"meetings\" that keep the TLs away from their desks. Training is uneven at best; you are expected to rely on the people who sit near you more than on your TL or on training and since there's not always a set process for handling issues, this is a problem. As mentioned above the lack of TL presence also means some employees spend more time talking than supporting their executives. The benefits are the best part of the job an...more ProsFree food, great health benefits, time off easy to get and PTO time is generous ConsWay too many very young coworkers, EAs are expected to manage their own time who just aren't mature enough to do so, managers with very uneven leadership skills, the people you support are bounced from person to person often and are bitter about it, pay does not adequately compensate for the workload nor is it really keeping up with the local COL 5.0 Management Consultant | Washington, DC | Jul 15, 2019 Accelerated work environment with demanding performance expectations which position you well in long term career McKinsey is a very competitive company to work for with well brand name in the industry. The firm is putting a lot of effort toward improving work life balance which is probably the toughest aspect of the job. Expect to travel extensively will staffed on an engagement with typical scheduled being travel from Monday from Thursday every week. Depending on industry focus and office location travel can be reduced if clients are locally based. Your experience in the firm can be quite variable given the staffing structure. Your experience of the firm will be greatly structured by the teams you work with, so making the time to develop deep relationships with teams you enjoy working with is very important in your progression at the firm. The firm is also experimenting with many additional career paths from the traditional generalist consultant. Job security/advancement is unique to the firm/industry. Opportunities for advancement are plentiful and expected. However, it comes with a steep performance curve which is also expected. Falling from the growth expectations will eventually lead to \"counsel to leave\". Turnover is very high compared to other industries. On the flip side, the experience gained from working in McKinsey should lead to great employment opportunities outside the firm 4.0 Coach | Chicago, IL | Nov 29, 2018 McKinsey Implementation: a different kind of McKinsey consultant McKinsey Implementation (MI) doesn't look for the standard Ivy league undergrad or top 5 B school applicant. Instead, since MI focuses on driving real lasting impact with clients (as opposed to traditional high-minded strategy problem solving), it looks for candidates with real work experience (generally at least 6 years) that know how to get things done. As a result, MI consultants have an extremely wide range of backgrounds and experiences. Additionally, the learning and development opportunities are immense. My initial training was better than almost any training I received in the military (and was located in Santiago, Chile!). Most importantly, while MI strives to provide the greatest impact possible for each and every client, it does so with a mind toward a sustainable lifestyle for its consultants. Each study begins with team members stating their lifestyle goals and boundaries, and the team works from there. Overall McKinsey Implementation has been a great career choice for me coming out of the Navy. Prosdevelopment opportunities, wide industry/function exposure, sustainable lifestyle, driving actual impact for clients ConsNew aspect of McKinsey (value prop not well-known among partners) 5.0 Coach | Kentucky | Oct 21, 2018 Work with the best people on interesting, high impact problems McKinsey is a fast-paced, high performance workplace where the demands are high but the work is extremely rewarding. Some key benefits include: + Amazing people - you will be surrounded by brilliant and personable colleagues. The work is challenging, but there is a pervasive attitude of being in it together - I have found everyone to be tremendously supportive and I continue to be amazed by the caliber of all those I have worked with + Unparalleled opportunities for growth and development - the pace of learning is unlike anything I have experienced outside of the firm, and there are great opportunities to explore new industries and functions + Work with clients on to drive change at pace on interesting, high impact problems - the name of the game in consulting. In all my experience, I have found McKinsey's approach to be highly effective in driving impact and seeing fast results. The firm is also committed to building client capabilities and helping them actually make the changes they need to succeed long term; this is a specific focus of McKinsey Implementation ProsLearning and development, interesting work, people, benefits, compensation ConsLong hours, extensive travel (great for some, not for others!) 1.0 Manager | Florida | Dec 20, 2015 Beware! McKinsey & Company is one of the top companies to work for but beware that this only applies if you have a career as a Consultant, Engagement manager, etc and working on the Client side. However if you're working in Operations, Reconciliations, Card Service, Purchasing, Procurement... you won't have a life, you will be humiliated, yelled at and you will put in more than 50 hours a week. Yes you'll have great benefits and vacations but you'll work during your vacation or expect a call from your manager. If you leave on vacation, you'll pay the price when you return. It's a nightmare. Some that have been there for several years, are use to this type of treatment and think this is normal. Leaving that place was the best thing I've done!! The only positive thing was to have McKinsey in my resume which it landed me a great job with great people who actually treat me with respect. I want people to know so they won't go through the same nightmare I went through. If you land an interview, please ask the right questions, make sure this place is for you. Ask the employees questions about their supervisor, manager, etc, ask them if there happy, ask about work & life balance. Think twice about it if you have a family and kids... because you won't be spending much time with them. 2.0 Executive Assistant | New York, NY | May 26, 2020 McKinsey is a Toxic Place for EAs The longer you are at McKinsey, the more your skills continue to plummet. Most of the EAs at McKinsey don't know how to use Microsoft Powerpoint, Excel and Word. I was told by both partners who I support, to tell my manager that I am doing much less than I am, because they thought she was jealous of me - I think this perfectly describes the culture and the dynamic between EAs and the managers. Favorites get the time off, and the non favorites get reprimanded for taking a sick day. The EA pool is a revolving door - I've been at McKinsey for five years, and have met over a hundred EAs who have come and gone. The chief complaint for those who don't stay is the EA managers and the company culture - it's us and them. EAs are often talked down to, they support partners who don't offer any background or input into their calendars, but will yell at you, cuss at you, and flat out call you stupid if you don't read their minds correctly. If you continue to complain about partners who are abusive and go to HR, the manager will retaliate and say your insubordinate and have a bad attitude. This place is toxic and a dead end job. 3.0 Junior Buyer | Miramar, FL | Feb 1, 2016 Horrible people work under Procurement Most management that work under Procurement- GPG- do not have experience in procurement. They are only there because they know someone higher up. It's a great company if you work on the consulting side and starting at the bottom will not get you there. They only hire consultants from top 10% in ivy league schools. If you work as an assistant in procurement, be careful who your managers are. Some will belittle you, yell at you in from of people over the most stupid thing and require you to take a test before being hired which doesn't apply to assistant work at all. Benefits are great if you are a full time employee and they won't let you take time off in the first year. Following year, approach with caution. This place is all about politics and favoritism. If you get on the wrong side of a manager, you won't get a promotion. They are experts are making you believe you will move up and when the time comes they will give you some excuse. They will try to give you the least amount of money and work you like a dog. Only good to put on resume because of the name. Prosbenefits, good for resume Consread above 5.0 Engagement Manager | Houston, TX | Nov 6, 2017 McKinsey consultants are the Jedi's of management Once a McKinseyite, always a McKinseyite. McKinsey is the best launchpad for CEOs for good reason. You are groomed from day 1 to act and think like a CEO. You have to drink the Kool Aid and \"talk\", \"act\", and \"behave\" McKinsey or you will be given feedback, which can be ruthless. I probably spent the best years of my life here and would do it all over again without hesitating, but the absolutely non-existent work/life balance really gets to you. I saw countless people \"break\" mid project (analysts/associates crying, managers fainting and ending up in the hospital due to stress, etc.) Most of the most successful people I met at McKinsey have absolutely personal life (no girlfriend, no dog, no plant). Nothing. Nada. They live to work. It's a great experience, but it's not for everyone. ProsUnmatched brand name, great meritocratic pay, superb benefits, powerful network, incredible exposure to top management ConsAbsolutely no work/life balance, horrible lifestyle, pay per hour you're better off working at McDonald's, endless travel 5.0 Executive Assistant | Saint Petersburg, FL | Jun 3, 2013 Job Description Scheduled internal and external meetings Direct contact for 8 consultants, to provide them with a steady workflow that made sense for each client they were serving. Responsible for managing all consultants calendars Booked all travel arrangements, including International arrangements (hotels, car service / rental car, flights) Worked directly with confidential client information to ensure the consultant and client were working on the same terms. Scheduled team meetings for the entire duration of the study, typically on a weekly basis Reconciled expenses for each consultant I served Submitted time cards for all consultants on a bi weekly basis Answered all phone calls and emails in a timely and professional manner on all levels Schedule client conferences, to include all details such as, supplies and material, presentations, and catering 3.0 Project Manager | Tampa, FL | Jun 4, 2018 Love the company but Big Brother MGMT is outdated This is for the Tampa office, only. I really enjoyed working for McKinsey. My actual manager was awesome, and really strived to make my happy. However, the office management at Tampa is very outdated. They are mainly concerned about your timesheets, which are ridiculously confusing to fill out. Personal and sick days must go through them and your manager, even though the office MGMT has no idea what you do. You're given laptops, but you cannot work remotely no matter what. It's just bizarre. The pay is below average for the area, and they hire people who are over-qualified for the positions. Wouldn't be so bad except promotions are as rare as unicorns. People who apply within and have worked there for years are often told they don't meet the qualifications for the next level.
