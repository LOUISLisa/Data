Carers work long hours and often miss their break entitlements because of heavy work load. When we are short-staffed, agency carers are drafted in but many haven't worked at the home before which is difficult because you feel like you are training a new carer up which puts us even further behind. Management are lacking in social skills and often disrespect their staff. A bit of respect and the odd 'thank you' here and there wouldn't go amiss, so maybe the company could devise an e learning course for them so that they can practice good supportive management skills. The staff are great, but the turnover is shocking and people tend to move on to alternative employment fairly soon after joining this company. The company are fully aware of this and haven't put anything in place to rectify the situation. It is in the resident's benefit that they see the same friendly faces each day, not faces that come and go every week. The hardest part of the job is working short staffed. This company claims to pride itself on delivering the kindest of care yet allow their staff to work under pressure struggling to provide the kindest in care because the home is short staffed. If there aren't enough staff on duty, the residents suffer and it really is as simple as that! The e learning courses are insulting. The recent modules are aimed at 5-8 years. The 'preparing for inspection' module is ...more ProsMeeting Lovely Residents ConsThe company and it's negative attitude towards staff members 2.0 Care Assistant | Lyndon, KY | Sep 16, 2014 Joke of a place I was so happy when I was offers a job with HC One 6mths ago but now I hate the place with a passion. You get no time to sit with the residents and talk with them. You get no recognition from the manager and when you have booked your annual leave months in advance they cancel it without telling you even if you are going to loose Â£1000 they just do NOT care for their staff and they defo so NOT care for the residents. The manager of my home is very rude and has no manners, I am yet to meet a member of staff that actually like the manager and that don't have a bad thing to say about him. In my opinion I would NEVER put any relative or friend in the home as they do NOT get seen to properly due to the carers being treated badly they just don't seem interested in the residents. When I started caring I didn't realise I wouldn't get to have time with the residents which is the main reason I took the job, I find it very upsetting as I like to sit and talk with the residents and and try to make them feel at ease but instead we only get to talk with them when we are either feeding or changing their pads which I find utterly disgusting. If you are thinking of working with HC One then please ask the other carers/staff what the home is like and more importantly what the manager is like as I am 99% sure you will be very disappointed in the way both staff & residents are treated by the management. I am still currently working here but am desperately seeking other employment. Prosfree meals is the only pro I can think of. Consworked to the point if exhaustion. No recognition. Very bad management. 1.0 Care Assistant | Lancashire, DE | Aug 4, 2014 HC One AKA The Comedy Store Absolutely The Comedy Store! A typical day at work consists of working a long tiring back-breaking 12 hour shift frequently short-staffed. The Home management team? Fit for The Jerry Springer Show, but not up to the job running a care home. Human Resources? Remember the sitcom, Some Mother's Do Ave Em? Frank Spencer and Betty? Say no more! Co-workers? Brilliant but sadly losing a lot of them to better paid and more appreciative companies. The hardest part of the job is actually clocking in and forcing your feet to walk towards the clock machine of a morning - Oh and seeing your drab 4 weekly wage slip. The most enjoyable part of the job is going out for a ciggie at 19.30pm and clocking off at 20.00pm. At 20.02pm you feel that you have just been released off death row! The freedom of getting out of the place is quite overwhelming. What have I learned? To never fill out an application form again for this company. The lack of appreciation from the managers is shocking. Staff are never offered any support and you are really made to feel worthless. The only upside is the staff you work with - well some of them, and the lovely residents that live in the home. As long as they are looked after and cared for, who cares what the management thinks.I know I don't! ProsTaking the mickey out of the management. ConsNot enough seating for the smoking area! 1.0 Care Assistant | Yorkshire, VA | Mar 6, 2016 Awful place to work What an awful place to work especially on a night time you get no help expected to work by yourself to be honest I think it is dangerous working by myself especially with residents that suffer with dementia 16 residents expected to look after I have had to leave due to this and the awfull people that work there. I would never ever recommend hc-one to anybody terrible. It's all about earning big money for those at top and cutting staff that care for the residents they don't care for staff and especially paying Â£6.75 an hour for working nights is awful. They take an hour off your wage for break when you don't even get 2 mins to sit down and also they say you will receive training and have a mentor but that is a lie there throw you in deep end especially when u have never worked in care before with people that suffer from dementia expecting me to change people's pads and give personal care when you only been there 2 days absolutely discraceful company lack of training lack of support lack of everything another kind caring person that really wonted to make a difference and I got pushed out. 5.0 Healthcare Assistant | West, TX | Apr 21, 2020 Great place to work I've been working for HC-one for less than a year . You get class room training along with online training and assessments. The first week or so I shadowed 2 work colleagues until I had my manual handling completed . The care home I work in I cannot fault , from day one I have been made welcome and feel like part of the team . I get on well with all staff members and they have been there to help me every step of the way to get to where I am today . With the current coronavirus situation we are really pulling together to keep our residents safe , the managers are regularly having meetings with us keeping us updated on any information and are showing their support to us . I enjoy the work I do and it is very rewarding working with the residents. The only down side is the pay which is minimum wage I think all care workers should get at least the national living wage especially at the moment when we are putting ourselves at risk with coronavirus. And like many others are trying to support our own families. 4.0 Nursing Assistant | England, AR | Aug 12, 2016 Great training if you want it HC-One offer a good training and development program for Carers (and for Nurses) and some of the homes also do a Nursing Assistant career path which means carers can earn more per hour and get a transferable qualification slightly higher than that of a senior carer. It can be quite quick to work through the program depending on what home you are at and if you have a supportive manager - can be as little as 6 months. It fits nicely with the day to day duties you would expect as a carer in a nursing home and you get to spend a bit more time with the nurses (who aren't as aloof as they can sometimes come across!!) and of course with the residents. It makes it easier to be able to support residents more fully rather than having to leave and get a nurse for some of the simple, common sense tasks, that most carers know they could do if only they were allowed to - so the all round relationships are much better. ProsTraining, residents, nice atmosphere 2.0 Care Assistant | Earth, TX | Jun 20, 2018 Be unkind care company Minimum wage working night shift, loads of paper work to fill out, no over time incentive for new staff. Not informed of any staff benefits if any at all, always short staffed especially on nights, worked like slaves, and expected to do several things at once. HC one pay no over time rate, no weekend rate, no incentives, meals hit and miss on night shift, heard staff meals may be stopped all together. Most residents lovely, but staff being run ragged. HC one are taking advantage of kind caring hard working staff, they are a very unkind company, who appear to be kind only on paper to residents, and staff. Feeling a very under valued care worker by this money grabbing company. Hardest part being rushed off my feet Enjoyable part finishing work at end of shift ProsFriendly bunch to work with, some lovely residents Conslong hours no breaks especially on nights 1.0 Nurse | Brookdale, SC | Nov 1, 2019 Terrible company to work for Management don\u2019t care about the residents only about filling the beds and making money, they are not interested if there is staff shortage just expect staff to get on with it, the manager would never offer to help and spends more time outside smoking. You never get time to have a break even though breaks are unpaid. The quality of the food is awful and they wonder why residents lose weight. You learn not to complain because there\u2019s no point and you would be labelled trouble causer, management only show an interest when an inspection is due, you would almost believe they actually cared then. I would avoid HC-One at all cost as a staff member and resident.the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting some lovely residents and knowing at least you have tried to make a difference. 1.0 Catering Manager | Lancashire, DE | Dec 4, 2019 the most awfull place to work i have worked in care homes and hospitals over the past 25 years as a chef i must say i have never worked for a company like h c one the management of this care home are all bent do not care about there staff forcing staff to work long hours very under staffed due to the homes bad management complete cover ups very large turn over of staff not interested in waste costing the lots company lots of money wasted money if you report a serious heath and safety issue above your manger head because they don\u2019t care the you are bullied constantly and extreme accusations are made about you that are untrue 1.0 Nursing Home Administrator | Remote | Dec 6, 2015 Ridiculous I just left working with hc-one drummohr this week. The home is ridiculous. The management are a waste of time and there is constant back stabbing and bad mouthing. They say you have to use your own initiative they then micro manage you to death. This is by far the worst company i have worked for and i would never recommend them to anyone. They are the most untrustworthy, thieving, backstabbers i have worked with. This is not just domestivs and carers but also the managers. Total waste of time working here. ProsNone ConsStaff, pay, management, everything.
