You have to do really bad to be terminated. Attrition is caused mainly by employees more than from management. I like working here. It can be monotonous at times, but you can make a difference. There is always something new to learn. Sometimes it can be very busy and you have to keep up. Sometimes it can be very slow, but it's up to you have you can use that time. There is a lot of material to learn from, leaders are knowledgeable. Can they do better for the employees, of course, no job environment is perfect, but they try. 4.0 Customer Service Representative | National, WV | Aug 10, 2017 Productive It is a 40hr work week.
