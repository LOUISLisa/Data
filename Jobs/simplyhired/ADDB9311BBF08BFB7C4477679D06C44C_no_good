    "Body": " Packer Frito-Lay North America - 3.4 Denver, CO Apply Now Job Details Full-time$18 an hour3 days ago Benefits Health Insurance 401(k) Matching Vision Insurance 401(k) Full Job Description The Full-Time Packer position is responsible for constructing boxes and packing them full of products you already know and love. A key component of PepsiCo's success, Frito-Lay has been making the very best snacks for over 80 years. Classic Lay's , Cheetos , and Doritos are just a few of the products that you would be packing in one of our manufacturing facilities. Although you will start out working for Frito-Lay, this job can open the door to career opportunities with our parent company, PepsiCo. Work hours average between 40 and 50 hours per week, mainly in the evening and many shifts work overnight. It takes teamwork for a facility to run smoothly, so you can expect to work weekends and holidays with the rest of the crew. We also offer unbeatable benefits including health insurance, dental and vision, retirement savings benefits including 401(k) with company contribution, vacation days and much more. If you have never worked in a warehouse environment before, you are welcome to apply. What you can expect is to be working on your feet for the entirety of your shift near heavy machinery in a loud manufacturing environment. Frito-Lay manufacturing facilities are also large. While we want everyone to feel comfortable, our ability to control the temperature is limited. Indoor warehouse working conditions are impacted by seasons and the weather. Our team has a reputation for speed and we obsess over numbers. We measure nearly every activity that occurs on the manufacturing floor. This is because we are constantly trying to better ourselves. Here is a list of some of the more frequent tasks you could expect to perform during the course of the workday: You will construct boxes and pack them with Frito-Lay products, either manually or with the help of automated machines. You will perform frequent quality checks, such as making sure labels are correct. You will maintain a clean and safe work area (safety is everyone's job). You will clean and sanitize lines during changeovers from one product to another. You will be setting up lines during a changeover process, such as when we switch from making Cool Ranch Doritos to Nacho Cheese Doritos. Your role might include placing stickers and wiping down machines and making minor adjustments to machinery. You will also be pushing waste totes from our production area to a compactor, securing it with a latch, and rolling them back to our production floor. Reworking products is another task you will do daily: the team takes any product that does not meet our quality standards and puts them off to the side. You will review our production schedule daily. How many boxes will you need? As a Packer, understanding the production schedule and planning for your shift is important. You will troubleshoot minor mechanical issues. If you have never worked in a manufacturing environment before, please know that this position involves repetitively moving the arms and torso while continually standing for many hours. Packers are expected to stay on the line until someone relieves you for your break. Whether you are experienced or not, please be sure that you meet the following minimum requirements: You are 18 years of age or older You will be required to work on weekends, holidays as well as off shift You are able to stand and walk for extended periods of time with or without a reasonable accommodation You are able to climb, bend, reach, stoop, kneel, and stretch for extended periods with or without a reasonable accommodation You are able to repeatedly lift, carry, push, pull, and handle products with or without a reasonable accommodation You will regularly wear a hairnet, safety glasses, bump cap, and steel-toed shoes for the duration of your work day. People often ask what kind of characteristics will make them successful in this position. Do you think you have what it takes to perform at our level? Here is an idea of what managers are looking for: High Energy: have you ever wished that your coworkers moved as quickly as you do? At Frito-Lay, you will find yourself surrounded by a team that motivates one another to work at a fast pace with a laser focus on the task at hand. Detail Oriented: you make a conscious effort to review expiration dates, and use correct boxes and labels to ensure high quality work.

We closely track performance and efficiency throughout work shifts because your performance helps the team achieve overall performance goals. Teamwork: we are dependable and accountable to one another because of our shared passion to attain targets and goals.
