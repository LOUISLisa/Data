Varsity Tutors supports families to meet their educational goals, and I feel as an employee I am supported to meet my career goals. I have had different roles within this company and with that, different managers. In every aspect, I have felt cared for and supported. I am also very grateful for my flexibility in schedule. Overall, I feel respected and have had a great experience working for Varsity Tutors and would recommend Varsity Tutors to anyone. 3.0 Civil Engineer | North Carolina | Mar 20, 2020 Good tutoring platform, but low paying Varsity is a good place to start tutoring, but the split between the company and the tutor is ridiculous, and the support is good but not great. If they put tutors on a sliding pay scale by experience and income, it would be much better. 3.0 Engagement Specialist | Tempe, AZ | Apr 10, 2019 Fun Environment I really loved my time at Varsity Tutors. The office manager in my office worked hard to keep us happy from having the kitchen stocked with snacks to organizing S'Mores days and Build your own Stir Fry type food bars. Music is always playing throughout the different departments and the atmosphere was always casual and comfortable. I just wish that the company paid more recognition to the tutor engagement team. The company is extremely sales oriented and in the end, it made me feel undervalued as an employee. Prosfully stocked kitchen, huge referral bonus, casual office culture Conscompany cares more about sales than any other team 3.0 Tutor | Sherman Oaks, CA | May 24, 2019 Varsity tutors is a good side money job As a tutor I found myself encountering a very well organized company that has all the tools you may need for a successful online or in person tutoring company, but it is not paid as well as it could and it is more of s temporary job in my opinion 3.0 Education Specialist | Tempe, AZ | Jun 20, 2019 Great culture. Depends who your manager is. Pay not the best. The culture is uplifting, depending on who your manager is. The first three months of training they have you thinking nothing but the positive because of course that\u2019s how you should feel with a new job, but it was deceitful. Everything they tell you is unicorns and rainbows until you do the research yourself or talk to the people that have been there awhile. The new pay scale was set up earlier this year, \u201cfor people to make a glorious amount of uncapped commission\u201d but really it was a massive budget cut. You don\u2019t make near as much commission compared to those who have been there over a year. Be prepared to have multiple managers within the first 6 months to a year. I was there 6 months and had 3! I\u2019m all for learning as much as I can about my company but along with each new manager comes different rules. Some abide by the rule book and some don\u2019t care and are more hands off. 1st one being the best manager to my last being a super micromanager. I was \u201cpromoted to Another team\u201d when really all that means is rather difficult leads and harder to close. Once that transition happened, the quota was difficult to hit and it then became a numbers game. While they have a great work environment, some managers have fun and create a relaxed environment, not all managers are like that. They do provide lots of food and ping pong tables, which I never got to play because my manager was Up in it with everything I did through the day. Each time I left my desk, I\u2019d have to Send an IM or if I...more ProsFree food, energy drinks, fun events, culture hit or miss ConsMicromanagers, no work life balance, basically required to work over time. New pay scale hold you back from making money. High turnover 4.0 Tutor | Mount Vernon, NY | Mar 7, 2017 good start its a good job to have on the side to earn some extra pocket money. work around your own time and gain tutoring experience. Easy to apply and pays electronically which is convenient. 5.0 Tutor | Remote | Jun 30, 2020 Enjoyable and productive job! Varsity Tutors is a very enjoyable and rewarding job. As for my experience, I enjoy helping advance students on the online platform. It's very convenient and I feel a sense of accomplishment seeing the growth of my students. The review materials are readily available for use and practice for tutoring students. The different challenge levels are awesome because it helps me as well as my students to gauge progress. ProsReadilly available tutoring materials and resources ConsOk pay 4.0 Tutor | Mesa, AZ | May 28, 2019 Flexible Schedule/Contract work Working as a tutor is very flexible in that you can create your own schedule and work as little or as much as you want. However, the majority of the jobs are early-late afternoon. It's a great part-time job for students or any qualified individual looking for some extra cash. You get paid within a few days of tutoring. The down side is they do not pay certified teachers very well. Teachers should be compensated more for the knowledge and experience they have in their field. ProsYou can create your own schedule/great part-time work ConsYou don't get paid very much as a tutor; even if you are a certified teacher in your subject area 4.0 Technical Support Specialist | Tempe, AZ | Apr 4, 2020 The company is small, but growing Just be ready for the realization that you are a part of a very large and growing company. It may feel like a smaller company due to the sparseness of employees working remote across the country, but it is very much still a fast growing company that has leadership at the executive level that you will likely never interact with. Small feel, big company. 3.0 Educator | Clayton, MO | Aug 6, 2019 Competitive, fast paced environment Very fast paced sales environment. Large scale call center. Good company but very much still a start up. Lots of change, and not always good change. Growth feels too fast.
