they take advantage of temp workers From the get go, they gave me a lot of misinformation as to what my job actually entailed. I was told my position was going to be IT oriented and computer oriented, I came to find on my first day I was a glorified envelope filler. All I did was sit there, fill envelopes, and that was it. Later on they tell me I have to switch to first shift off of second which is what I was hired for if I want to receive training and move any further working for them. I accepted begrudgingly, go on first shift to get trained to find out I operate a machine that barely functions for longer than a minute or two without breaking down that fills envelopes. If I had known that this was going to be my job role, I would have turned the offer down. Many other workers from temp agencies experienced the same idea as me, told one thing got another. The morale on the work floor was extremely low, I rarely heard a good thing about the place. On top of all this, some workers have been temporary there for a year and a half or more despite doing their jobs no problem, but then they pick someone with attendance issues to become full hire when they've been there for 6 months, which shows clearly there is favor going on. I more or less figured out the reason they keep people temps for so long, is that then the company can get away without having to give employees pay raises or benefits if they keep them temps for as long as possible. One employee I worked with on first shift had been there for over 2 years ...more ProsAn insane amount of overtime if you want, you could practically live there if you wanted to. ConsManagement, non-transparency, short breaks, the machines and tools they give you to work with barely function if at all, stressful environment, toxic employees 3.0 Human Resources Specialist | Arlington, VA | Dec 20, 2013 Has the right idea, but implementation of anything seems impossible Thales is a huge multi-national French company. It can be a great place to work, but it does not welcome creativity and innovation they way they profess, at least not in USA. For a high tech organization all of they systems are rather outdated. It was just this year that a paperless system was put into place for expense reports. All projects within the function areas (HR, Legal, Communications, Finance, Operations) are complex and require level after level of review and approval. This is what happens when you acquire small companies and don't take the time to introduce them to the rest of the family properly. What is the saying...united we stand, divided we fall... yes that is the one. If a person is up for the challenge why not get the great experience, you won't know a good job until you experienced a bad one. There is a big difference between working in the USA for this company vs other countries. Thales Group seems to care a lot for their employees and wants to be a great place to work and strives for that success, however it seems that the morale and energy dies out when it crosses any ocean. As much as we are part of the \"Group\" there is definitely that step-child feeling. I think this is absolutely the right type of company for certain people, but lacks a lot for our Gen Y. They are putting in idea rooms, try to encourage mind mapping, but they can't even update their own social media sites on a regular because those sites are blocked. Oh yeah they put in a...more ProsYou learn to adapt to quick change and agility is key ConsConstant change and not always good changes 4.0 Technical Project Manager | Fullerton, CA | Jul 31, 2012 Professional, ethically strong, defense contractor This is the most professional company I have worked for in my career. Most co-workers and staff are easy to work with. Since it serves the defense industry both domestic and international, it has extensive processes in place. Most projects are very large, taking two or more years to implement. Some technologies used are cutting edge, depending on the project, but because of the long duration of projects, many tools and software technologies used are lagging behind industry standards. Projects are often highly aggressive with all staff working long hours to meet deadlines and budgets. Projects are usually well planned out, but due to the comfortness in following established waterfall processes, accommodating changes to requirements can be cumbersome and slow. Front line managers as well as the development staff support one another well. Senior management tend to be distance from the technology and rely on reports, charts, and numbers to run projects without spending the time and effort to know the staff. Good place to work for people who are looking to work with established *safe* technologies that take years to complete. Prosprofessional employees, starting to embrace agile processes. Consfew people get to work with latest innovative technologies, rigid organizational structure, process heavy, not nimble. 4.0 Bid Manager | Irvine, CA | Oct 9, 2013 Good Place to work with challenge and reward, with good benefits, wrong location Manage the bid preparation of engineering non recurring tasks, and hardware bills of material for custom in flight entertainment systems on large commercial aircraft, broadband connectivity solutions, cost benefit analysis, task detail summaries, schedules, bid kickoff meetings for commercial clients and global field sales support efforts. Audio/video, state of the art software, hardware development, systems, customer installation and support, test and certification engineering, tech pubs bid management and approvals through the Director of Engineering. Detail research and analysis on large commercial aircraft seat layouts, wiring and component design involved in the bid process that was then fed to finance for bid and proposal pricing and completion. Management is too concerned about corporate level concerns and thus not concerned about the employee. Co-workers are very self centered and not team players. Too many cultures to deal with so the hardest part of the job is dealings within my own department. The Engineering employees are very normal and team players. The most enjoyable part of my job is winning a proposal! ProsGreat Benefits ConsCultures of long lasting ethnic groups of employess 5.0 Logistics Associate | Jamaica, NY | Dec 7, 2016 Great environment where all everyone helps support eachother. A typical day at work would consist of me working alongside other logistic coordinators across the US to move spare parts to other bases to ensure units are available for replacement. I also manage the stock room for several customers and the vehicle fleet at the base. I receive and ship out numerous parts in a day for repair or for increasing stock levels. I learned how to read spare levels and learn to predict where parts may need to be sent to supply other bases. I learned the in flight entertainment system and how to remove and replace various units on airplanes. Management works closely with staff and provide an open door policy. They are willing to help clear any roadblocks when performing your daily duties. My co workers are very helpful, they are willing to help and share their knowledge of the in flight entertainment systems. The hardest part of my job would have to be doing a monthly inventory count of over 500+ parts and ensuring by part number and serial number that is matches our Servo system. The most enjoyable part about my job would have to be the environment, all of the staff coexist really well. ProsClose to home Consschedule changes, very few holidays off 3.0 Assembler | Phoenix, AZ | Feb 8, 2020 My supervisors were awesome. Some long term employees were very territorial, and inappropriately so, but their hidded compaints mattered. My direct supervisors are great and effective leaders. They maintained a high-morale environment. Senior management was out of touch. I experienced reverse discrimination that was not addressed at all. If I had done the same, I would have been fired. White, middle-aged males are now the most-discriminated, least employable demographic in the country, yet open discrimination against them by other minorities is not addressed. I also experienced a recent emigre touting the virtues of his own country and culture while excoriating things and personnel that are American. Why was he not disciplined. Why is such an unpatriotic person working for the sixth-largest defense contractor in the US (L3/Thales)? Those of us who put our lives on the line for this country should be heard in regards to this kind of unprofessional conduct. In my humble opinion, that particular employee, not only should have been fired, but his resident status should have been revoked as a hostile foreign national openly admitting so on our soil. 5.0 Software Engineer | Irvine, CA | Nov 14, 2016 Transformation of specification requirements and other documents into viable system architecture, requirements description, and then developed softwar Responsibilities: \u2022 Developed embedded test software for avionics equipment using Embedded C, Green Hills Integrity RTOS and Assembly. \u2022 Created test cases for database that was a leading factor for helping designers fix defects and update specifications. \u2022 Work closely with product test team to verify hardware test covered customer specifications. \u2022 Resolve software and hardware defects by working closely with other engineers to investigate, assign, and resolve defects, which put project back on schedule. \u2022 Implemented test procedures that verified and hardware and systems for video/audio router module without in-depth documentation that was adopted by project manager. \u2022 Develop firmware specifications from product requirements documents that help hardware engineers debug initial prototypes 4.0 SMT Operator | Clarksburg, MD | Jun 11, 2012 productive,educational and fun place to work with year around activity from Thales recreational club like Thales Potlock,summer cookout, chili contest A typical day starts from 7 am to 3.30 PM on first shift , second shift from 3.30 PM to 12 mid night.One tea/coffee brake for 15 minutes and lunch for 45 minutes.I was started as assembler in 2001 may working on battery cassette line on various steps on building battery cassette.At the time of reduction in force my last position was SMT operator. Through out my 11 years of experience at Thales, I had been through various positions as assembler,test technicians,team lead,supervisor & SMT operator. It's been fun,Teamwork, & challing to work with co workers and management team throughout the manufacturing floor.Most challenging part of my job is rejection from Q.A. The most enjoyable part of the job is to get the job done on time and delivered on time to our customer. Proshealthy food on every wednesday bagel and fruit, and complementary tea & coffee 3.0 Clerical Support | Irvine, CA | Jul 16, 2018 Decent pay, little chance to advance, company is very short-sighted. Thales pays pretty well, which makes it harder to leave for better pay. Virtually no promotions from within. Very short-sighted management, constantly reinventing and reorganizing. Too much flying by the seat of the pants, and a do it wrong, fix it later mentality across the company. Management does not like to be wrong, or challenged, and they will retaliate. Thales touts a one team philosophy, but the reality is different. More like the NFL, many teams fighting each other. I like the people I work with. I am encouraged to work independently, as long as my job is done. My hours are flexible, and PTO is usually approved without question. Overall, it's not the worst place to work, just don't expect to race up the company ladder. The job you start with will be yours for a while. ProsDecent pay, good experience, flexible hours when needed. ConsPoor long-range planning, not much advancement possible, cross-department teamwork sorely lacking. 5.0 Order Picker | Clarksburg, MD | Jul 31, 2017 A fun place to work .With a club to join and chance to when prises. It was always a great day. I knew what was expected of me .I was very well adjusted and enjoyed my job. I was able to succeed in meeting the deadlines. I learned to always to be a great team player and co-worker. My manager was always on top of the work schedule and kept us on top of production. Management was always there and would help to solve any and all difficult situations. It was a great work environment. Where everyone treated each other with respect. . I don't believe anything was very hard. I enjoyed working for a great manager and with excellent co-workers. We were a great team. I loved my job!!! If I were to be called back to work for this company. I must definitely would returned. I would have to say this has been a very rewarding job. I believe other employees would have to agree. ProsGreat Pay, Insurance, 401K, Bonus checks, Vacation time ConsI can't think of any at this time. Questions And Answers about Thales How often do raises occur at Thales?
