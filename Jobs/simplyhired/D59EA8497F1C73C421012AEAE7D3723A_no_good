Its definitely not the place that it used. to be. The hours were long with no compensation. Lots of givebacks. A lot expected of support staff. They lure you in with the promise of bonuses and travel, but you rarely make enough or can get the time to do so. Instead of promoting from within, they often get people from the major European carriers as for some reason. Most days are miserably stressful and the saving grace in the health insurance which has gone up over the last few years. Be wary, they must not be doing well at all. Emirates just let go of a good 80% of its US based workforce and thousand more world wide. For the best airline in the world, I wouldn't expect that the first asset they would dump would be loyal employees. Proshealth insurance, international travel Conslong hours, rarely can take a lunch, poor moral 4.0 Customer Service Representative | Seattle, WA | Mar 10, 2014 glamorous I did like this airline however it was just the environment. 3.0 Flight Attendant | Headquarters, WA | May 12, 2013 Managing a part of performance Because of the nature of the role (ensure support and care is given to some needed staff), I have to be very flexible yet displaying care and compassion. As a senior in the department, I act also as a mentor to my colleagues, who are junior. The role is also to ensure rules and policies are applied. Proposing new ideas to implement and giving suggestions to improve is part of our objectives, and is only possible by ensuring a good team work. The hardest part of the job is to handle very sensitive cases throughout (severe sickness), with no real solution, but only support to offert. The most enjoyable has been the recognition for going the extra mile to make someone's day. By creating the department and contributing to its improvement, it gave me the opportunity to understand business needs and requirements, a high degree of quality of service, with a deep sense of attention to details. I am now ready to take a new turn in my career, sharing some new experiences, and applying my organizing skills for a more positve outcome. ProsDevelop a lot of soft skills, as well a creative ideas to improve current processes ConsNegative environement due to the nature of the role (handling sickness) 5.0 Area Supervisor | Terminal, UT | Feb 28, 2017 Multicultural workplace I have been working on one of the busiest airport in the world. One thing that I have learned is how to interact and be a cosmopolitan leader with the different cultures in the workplace and promote teamwork among them. Different culture because of the different nationalities that comprise our company. It was amazing on how we have accomplish our daily task on Airport operations with different nationalities and cultures involved in the working environment. I have learned also their beliefs and discipline which helped me how to have respect and adjust to the cultural differences. One thing I enjoyed are the foods, from spicy to sweet and simple to make one to the traditional food of their own. I am lucky also winning friends from from different countries, I call it my global friends.
