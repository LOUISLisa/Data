I manage to work by myself. I go to different places in metro Manila. The hardest part of the job is the traffic and waiting to long for passengers. 3.0 Deputy Director | Vietnam, PR | Nov 1, 2018 Much office politics at work Grab Vietnam is a start-up with HQ located in Malaysia and business grown in all south-east Asia. The nature of my work as Vertical Head at Country level is to build new product and service with high appreciation of local culture and people. I did enjoy much my time with Grab as I have been able to build such a dynamic team and trustful brand in Vietnam in a very short time. what I didn't like most is the politics in working environment. This made non-politic people feel tired and over stressed. ProsOpen for talent ConsPolitics 5.0 Executive | Empire City, OK | Dec 12, 2019 Downsizing The company was downsizing. There was some racial issue going on at the office but I persevered effectively. Anyhow the company was going through downsizing and I have to apply for other jobs 4.0 Back End Developer | Singapur, PR | Jan 4, 2017 Good place Usually the work is very well organized. Management needs to be more certain with a better roadmap. Switch locations within the company should be more flexible. Pros100$ worth taxi rides per week 2.0 | United States | Sep 21, 2017 Great paid company but very poor management Great company values that get lost at the top of the house. This is a very large company but the Vietnam side is run like very independent and undisciplined company. The issues within the operations do not get a chance to talk with another much and when that get improved then there will be some really great advancement to the company. Your work is really determined by the type of job you have and is really tied to your boss and what they allow. If you have a forward thinking boss then you can do almost anything within the company. Worst part of the job is that there a lot of really bad bosses. They promote not based on technical skill and people skills so some bosses might be smart and some might be not, thus they only interact in public to save their lives. These people seem to also shield you from the rest of the company. Overall a good place to get paid but not a good environment to work. If you want to find a good management team here, please try to move out quickly. ProsGood place to get paid ConsCulture and mid management team need to improve 5.0 Driver | View, TX | Jul 3, 2017 must work hard to enjoy the incentives > must have a target to achieve every week > keep a healthy body and mind > improve on communication skills and driving skills > share experiences of road block, traffic jams due to accidents with other drivers on the road > work smart to balance life and family Prosgood incentives in the beginning Constoo many drivers on board 3.0 Driver | Mobile, AL | Jun 14, 2020 No Comments Grab is a Good social company that cares for its drivers partners and the general public.Its staffs is competent just like its CEO.. Grab is a good and profitable company 4.0 Intern | Singapur, PR | Jan 30, 2020 Good but competitive environment So a typical workday would be going into office, checking all emails, going for meetings. People are friendly, management listens to you and you get to express your ideas. Working environment is good too 5.0 Busines | Marina, CA | Apr 7, 2020 Great Working Environment A typical day at work: Meetings What you learned: Too many Management: Good Workplace culture: Fast The hardest part of the job: Getting things done on time The most enjoyable part of the job: The whole experience 3.0 Driver | View, TX | Dec 18, 2016 Tech firm evolving Free lance grab driver, lots of area need fine tuning with their app. Many innovation ideas to capture market share from Uber. Up and coming in south east Asia. ProsNew ideas ConsLong hours Questions And Answers about Grab How do you feel about going to work each day at Grab?
