Poor management, abuse of power & bottlenecking. Promotion is not for proficient employees, it is for the employees that they like (regardless of efficiency) and to employees that may get subcontractor kickbacks. 1.0 Housekeeper/Laundry | Montgomery, AL | Jan 10, 2020 Not a very good environment to work in always drama with employee and customer They was not organized they hire people who don't know what to do they seek for workers who needs place to stay so they don't have to pay as much like as $50 for a week 1.0 Business Development Manager | Memphis, TN | May 27, 2020 Unstable Management, No Direction I was contacted by OYO via LinkedIn. The premise was great and I could see them fitting into the US market. The management however lacks a basic understanding of the US hospitality market and is quickly losing the trust of US hotel owners. The company direction and policy changes with the wind. In addition to this, the company cannot be trusted to fulfill its contractual promises to hotel owners. This makes the product nearly impossible to sell due to its poor reputation in the market. The company hires and fires regularly with no rhyme or reason. I would not recommend this company to anyone looking for a stable career. 1.0 Business Development Manager | Texas | May 16, 2020 Run fast and far Company is on the decline. Does not live up to promises, deals are always a moving target, does not appreciate its employees. Run fast and far from this company. 1.0 Business Development Manager | Kennewick, WA | Apr 30, 2020 An absolute dumpster fire I don't really need to say much, just know that when you're doing your research and you run into all of the negative articles and reviews, it is 100% true. This is an awful place to work and regardless of what they offer you, just know that it won't last too long as they will more than likely lay you off as soon as they they are having any financial troubles. It is really unstable. 1.0 Business Development Manager | San Francisco Bay Area, CA | Apr 30, 2020 Company was a total waste of time Company laid off almost entire sales team after rapid hire to fire churn and burn method. The sales director very high up in Bay Area Ca that was fired was arrested for child pornography and the company hired him and didint screen. Managers did not know what they were doing. Structure was set up to fail. Nobody survived. 1.0 Business Development Manager | Nebraska | Apr 12, 2020 Regretting I learned quite a bit and met some great people. As for the company and the way it is managed, poor in almost every way. Great idea but horrible execution and awful treatment of partners and employees. 5.0 Business Development Manager | West Virginia | Mar 27, 2020 Wish job security was a little more stable OYO is an excellent place to work, the culture is amazing and the people really make the company. They truly want to deliver a great value to clients and they are always making changes to better the company. I've been with the company over a year now in the US I have had opportunities to transfer two different territories to create more job security for myself. Our management team is truly amazing they are always there for support 1.0 Business Development Manager | Orlando, FL | Mar 3, 2020 Terrible work culture and company management Stay far far away. This company has been a failure and a let down from day one back from \"training.\" They hire way to many people to saturate the market, and fire everyone after 2-3 months unless you have multiple sales. Which is impossible with their current territory setup. Not to mention 90% of the hotel / motel owners completely hate OYO and their bad reputation. 3.0 Business Development Manager | Spokane, WA | Feb 15, 2020 Better hit the ground running The job I worked was fully remote and very fliexible. It's very hard to convince hotel owners to convert to a franchise they've never heard of. It's nearly impossible. Proshigh pay and schedule flexibility ConsIf you don't close a hotel in 3 months, you'll be let go Questions And Answers about OYO Rooms What is the best part of working at OYO? Asked Mar 16, 2020 Nothing because they were fake and they didnt do right so I wouldn't tell nobody about this job Answered Jun 1, 2020 OYO is not a stable company. The best part is controlling the day to day planning. Otherwise change is constant and reimbursement is sometimes slow for things such as mileage or client lunches and marketing materials. Answered Apr 16, 2020 If you were in charge, what would you do to make OYO a better place to work? Asked Mar 3, 2020 Everyone and everything Answered Jun 1, 2020 OYO has not adjusted well to the US market. They constantly change client contracts and have a poor attitude towards hotel owners and gaining their trust. Answered Apr 16, 2020 What is the interview process like at OYO? Asked Sep 12, 2019 They give you an offer, follow up the offer sending you emails addressed to someone else, call you 2 days before you start to say they are rescinding due to business plan changes. Do not quit your job in hopes that they actually have a job for you Answered Jan 2, 2020 Easy. They hire in mass numbers Answered Oct 19, 2019 How are the working hours at OYO? Asked Jul 11, 2019 Flexible and easy to work with. Answered Jan 24, 2020 It may seem flexible but the micro managing means calls morning and evening, plus more WhatsApp chat groups than you want to handle, there is nothing spectacular about this company. It\u2019s all a dog and pony show for SoftBank, whose the only real audience. Answered Oct 23, 2019 What questions did they ask during your interview at OYO?
