Questions And Answers about Gucci What tips or advice would you give to someone interviewing at Gucci? Asked Aug 26, 2017 Dont apply not a good work environment Answered Nov 24, 2019 Do your best job. Customers service and if you are sales person be the best Answered Jan 10, 2019 What advice would you give the CEO of Gucci about how to improve it? Asked Jan 30, 2017 Here's a brilliant idea... show your BoH staff some appreciation. How is it that the people that do the most, and have the most potential for your company, are the most under paid? Sales get fat commissions, management gets a bonus if the store does well, and your BoH staff gets more stress, more to do during the day, and the same pay. Example: Have all of your BoH staff not show up one day and see how well your store does. Next, have your sales staff not show up on a different day and compare sales. I bet the day the sales staff doesnt show up is the day that has better sales. The reason for this is because sales associates have become reliant on everyone else doing all the work for them. At the same time, there isn't anyone else to do the job of the BoH staff. But they can just as easily go to the floor and smile while they say, \"Hello, welcome to Gucci, what size do you need?\" Mind you, most companies are the same in the regard that they act like the BoH is the core of the company while doing absolutely nothing to make them feel like their work is as equal as that of a sales associate. But I have never felt the divide between the value of a sales associate and a BoH person so much as I did during my time here. Answered Jun 20, 2019 Improve work life balance. We are humans not robots. Answered Mar 18, 2019 What are some tips for doing well in the interview? Asked Mar 30, 2017 Eyes to Eyes Contacts , deep knowledge about the products and welcome the customer, with a smile and available and create a relationship so that you always come back to Gucci. Answered Aug 8, 2018 Eye to eye contact, respond frankly, smile, be calmed, shake hands firmly. Answered Jan 6, 2018 What is the typical pay of a Sales Assistant? Asked Jun 18, 2018 15or18 per hour and commission on sales and goals achieved Answered Aug 8, 2018 $15 per hour or minimum wage for the position. Gucci uses their name to lure potential employees and pays the least amount possible. Answered Jun 25, 2018 Do you have uniform Asked Apr 30, 2018 Yes you receive a full uniform. Answered Feb 8, 2020 No uniforms are needed as they want you to style yourself in the workplace. Answered Oct 16, 2019"
