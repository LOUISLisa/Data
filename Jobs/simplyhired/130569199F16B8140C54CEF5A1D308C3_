What educational background do you need to land a job in Chattanooga? There are no college educational requirements for many entry-level part-time jobs in Chattanooga. A high school diploma or GED will be enough. Mid-level and upper-level positions may call for an associate or bachelor's degree, even though they are part-time. Working within a large company, you may be required to communicate with others, and a company may be seeking a candidate with a college education. Other positions may require experience in the employer's field, although some training may be available. Often, a combination of experience and education is required to land jobs at this level. You will not need an M.A. or Ph.D. for most part-time jobs, unless you work in a highly specialized field such as education. Industrial training programs within the state of Tennessee, such as FastTrack, prepare workers for specialized fields where part-time work may eventually be provided. How can I land a part-time job in Chattanooga? You'll need to prepare a resume that stands out above the rest. Highlight any part-time or full-time employment that relates to the type of job you seek. For entry-level jobs, if you do not a large amount of relevant work experience, make sure to include academic accomplishments and extracurricular activities as well as volunteer projects that demonstrate your work ethic. You can also state the number of hours you are available to work. Your cover letter can also highlight what is in your resume and what you can offer the company. Be sure that your resume and cover letter state that you are seeking part-time work, so that will be clear from the beginning. Interviews may be conducted by video or telephone as well as in person. Practice answering common questions before the actual interview. Your enthusiasm and passion are your greatest assets in landing that part-time job. You want to position yourself as the optimal candidate in a competitive field. Whether the interview is by phone, video or in-person, you'll want your confidence to come across; moreover, you'll want the hiring manager to feel confident that you are the right person to hire. Be ready to demonstrate your knowledge of the company and ask a few questions that show how interested you are in joining its team. For a phone interview, take the call in a place that's free of background noise and where interruptions are unlikely. For a video or in-person interview, dress a little better than you would need to on the job, and let your voice and body language convey your energy and enthusiasm. You might find that networking at local business Meetups can be very helpful while expanding your circle of friends and associates. What are common jobs in this area? Part-time jobs at the entry level with flexible hours in the Chattanooga area include those of sales associate, merchandiser, mover, warehouse assistant, brand ambassador, customer-care associate, senior helper, driver, shift assistant, greeter and front-desk associate. Mid-level part-time jobs may be available in bookselling, medical transportation and news production. Other roles include those of brand representative, office assistant, receptionist, cook and museum educator. Manufacturing and construction are other industries to check for part-time jobs if you have experience as a factory worker or are a skilled carpenter, plumber or electrician. You might find a senior-level part-time position as an audiologist, fire door inspector, sonographer, or employee in military intelligence. Travel may be required for some advanced part-time jobs. According to our guide to part-time jobs in Chattanooga, some positions state that part-time work may lead to full-time employment if that is what you desire. What are the biggest industries for part-time jobs in Chattanooga? Chattanooga, at the crossroads of Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee, is a thriving region for manufacturing, natural resources and tourism, all of which may feature part-time positions. The city also has a designation as a Foreign Trade Zone, so associated part-time jobs may be available. Health services is another sector with a large presence in this city and could offer part-time work. Petroleum, processed foods, iron and steel products, furniture, machinery, pharmaceuticals, paper and textiles are more industries in Chattanooga that could provide part-time jobs. The city government in Chattanooga is another resource for part-time jobs. What kind of shifts can I work part-time in Chattanooga? If you are working as a driver, you may need to work evening shifts as well as weekends. Food services, restaurants and retail outlets may require flexible schedules that include working weekends, evenings, or holidays. Entry-level retail requires a flexible schedule that could include mornings if merchandising is involved. Mid-level part-time jobs in business, such as those in an office, will probably have you working daytime hours on weekdays. You may have more control over your part-time schedule if you're a professional like a doctor, lawyer or teacher. External resources It's a good idea to keep abreast of business developments and opportunities by reading publications like Chattanooga Trend, from the city's Chamber of Commerce, or the local newspaper, the Chattanooga Times Free Press. Part-time workers may qualify to join a trade union that is active in Chattanooga, such as the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) or the United Auto Workers (UAW). You might attend some of the events that are part of the Chattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce to meet more business people who may be hiring part-time employees. The University of Tennessee in Chattanooga offers internships, bachelor's and advanced degrees plus professional and noncredit courses that might help you find part-time work.
