Most employees with the skills to manage the more complicated logistics of cinema management are relegated to relatively low status while the \"faces\" of the company are put on track for regular promotion. If you are good at what you do, your job is fairly secure, but the work/life balance is pretty bad, thanks both to the nature of the business and the company's extremely (emotionally) detached management method. Unfortunately that is the only case in which management is hands off - because most managers in the company did not undergo any kind of formalized training, they fail to learn new skills and instead fall back on micromanaging specific areas of the business to the detriment of everything else. 3.0 Ticket Sales Representative | Jupiter, FL | May 5, 2018 bad management the management is not good and neither is the pay, good for highs coolers who need job, no advancement, no one does their job, can be fun sometimes since their a lot of people from your school. Prosdiscounts and free movie tickets Consmanagement and staff 5.0 Floor Supervisor | Rancho Santa Margarita, CA | Sep 5, 2015 Cinepolis had a great work atmosphere and a lot of advancement in the company When I started at Cinepolis I was hired as a runner, but i worked hard and quickly moved up the ladder. Within a week I became a member of the concessions team, then a server, and after sometime as a server I was promoted to Floor Supervisor. Although the work was stressful I learned many useful job and people skills working there and would recommend it to many people who can handle the stress. 3.0 Brand Ambassador | California | Oct 1, 2018 average entry level place to work Fun to work with other people, built some friendships. Management was not very good. not many opportunities to be promoted. Not very regulated. some perks, like seeing movies for free. 3.0 Actor | Laguna Niguel, CA | Nov 11, 2018 Fun work environment but loosely managed At Cinepolis everyone is encouraging and friendly. I greatly improved my barista skills and customer service abilities. Being a high end movie theater meant there was a pushed importance for satisfied costumers and a clean work environment. Being able to be scheduled in different departments including food running, concessions, and cleaning I was able to improve my work ethic and abilities in many more ways than if I had one set list of tasks every shift. The management was a bit rough at some times as there were many different supervisors and managers all with different standards and ideas of what was necessary. It was difficult to plan my weeks and weekends as well as they release the work schedule on Thursday. Overall I learned a lot of new skills and tasks to bring into my next jobs as well as how to communicate and work with management to create the best work environment. ProsFriendly coworkers, clear tasks, easy to stay busy ConsScheduling released late in week, too many managers with opposing ideas 3.0 Floor Supervisor | La Costa, CA | Nov 12, 2017 Great if your location has good management, terrible corporate managment The company as a whole has no appreciation for it's employees. Corporate heads cut employee of the month awards when they found out our GM was giving a $25 gift card to the employee of the month. Under paid employees with higher expectations for luxury theaters. Individual locations may have better management that makes the world of a difference, to an extent. Working at a restaurant/bar/theater has its own unique perks and feel. ProsFree movies and fun enviroment ConsDon't expect much appreciation or support from above 5.0 Customer Service Representative | Zona, WV | Feb 24, 2020 Super competitive. The schedule is variable and change every single week and you only have one day off. But the food is super good and the candy popcorn are amazing, and you get them for free as an employee. 1.0 Inventory Manager | Carlsbad, CA | Jul 17, 2019 Corrupt and immoral corporate Favors saving money and convenience over food/product quality, staff and guest safety, and sanitation. Malfunctioning equipment and severe lack of tools/items to correctly perform each job leads to further degradation and unsanitary results. (Ie: spoiled/uncooked food, no cleaning products to clean the bathrooms with regularly.) HR plays favorites and bullies. BBB please investigate. 3.0 Human Resources Business Partner | Carlsbad, CA | May 14, 2019 reviewd The company has come a long way but has a long way to go still. The company culture really needs to be improved on every level. I did have a great boss. Unfortunately the leadership has had very high turnover and everything has to be approved through Mexico before things can actually get done. 4.0 Event Coordinator | Laguna Niguel, CA | Sep 18, 2017 Enjoyable workplace I thoroughly enjoyed the clients I encountered on a daily basis. I was extremely excited to build relationships with our guests and my co-workers and in that sense it was always a joy to be at work. The culture of Cinepolis was fast paced and stressful, but always satisfying. ProsFree movies!
