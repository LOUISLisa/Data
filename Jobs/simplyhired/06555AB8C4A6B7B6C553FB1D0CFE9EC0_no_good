It was a rewarding time to work with our youth and provide uniforms and information to them. Helping the Captain out with forms and collecting money, completing the tasks that needed and must be completed. Stepped up in a leadership Role to Cover for the Captain and put in charge to run a smooth evening at cadets which was a pleasure. It was a passion that I loved and helping the youth embrace the opportunities at there finger tips. Being part of the training camps and trips was exciting. It was more a Volunteer position then a paid position. But it was a position that you were appreciated and valued by all. 5.0 Technician | Oak Harbor, WA | Apr 15, 2016 Overview of military service I have learned about the essential need for a team environment, mentoring and strong leadership. A good two way communication line is imperative. The diversity of the co-workers I've worked with has made the job as personally satisfying as I can hope for. I feel the hardest part of the job is being away from loved one in a uniquely challenging environment, not found anywhere else...this also serves as the most enjoyable part of the job in that there is no job that asks as much while developing such incredible skillsets.

This is an amazing place to learn valuable skills you will keep with you for life. It can be physically demanding, but very rewarding. It's an excellent place to meet friends for life, but be prepared to have no social life if you want to progress. It's also a difficult place to raise a family. But there are many opportunities you won't get with any other employer. Prosexcellent training, learning Consit can affect your personal life. 2.0 Supply Technician | The Country, NC | Jan 6, 2020 Slow to change and very set in the ways of the old culture.
