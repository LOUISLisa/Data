Representative | Phoenix, AZ | Aug 11, 2019 Top Company to work for I am a new hire at USAA and wanted to add my two cents. I worked a prior career in another profession and did employee advocacy for years. I recently retired and got a job with USAA with the goal of working a few years more. I have no insurance experience but wanted to work here and am eager to learn new things. AZ is not known for being en employee friendly state so many reviews on here are from people who have no experience working anywhere else. They would run back with their tail between their legs if they only knew. USAA is a very employee friendly company with amazing benefits. Pros- The facility is gorgeous! Spa, Gym, TV Rooms, Relaxation Room, Energy Room, break rooms, nice views! Beautiful Restaurants with not bad food, food discounts for healthy choices, and a Starbucks. Training- no experience, no problem. They pay you to pass your licensing test three times and you get 15 college credits while you are paid trained to work. Amazing quit frankly. If you are young it is worth it to work here just for the college benefits. Benefits- amazing- 10K for college, all benefits included and are good. 401 is one of the best in America.

When I first started there, I loved my job, and what I did for the customer. It was more of a customer service job. Back then Usaa cared more about the \"customer\", back in 1997-98. As time went on, and after Y2K and other significant events transpired, Usaa had to take a hard look at their finances because they weren't really taking good care of them, but suddenly they had to, because of world events, so then Usaa totally changed. They became more like other companies, & then everything just became about money, money, money, & numbers, numbers, numbers. They stopped caring about their customers, (the members), and their employees, and now they are just like every other corporation. Over time, my job just turned into a sales job, and I was trained to be this \"annoying\" sales person, who was constantly shoving 20 products down a member's throat every time they called in, whether they liked it or not. And believe me, the members cannot stand it. Most people I talk to nowadays can't stand Usaa. They think very little of Usaa. They do not think highly of Usaa, like they once did. As time went on, I noticed that the \"higher ups\" made it harder & harder for the regular employees to get approved for the annual bonuses too, as if to purposely do this, so that the men at the top, making the most money could get even bigger bonuses.

The office buildings and onsite amenities, especially at the home office in San Antonio, are top notch. That being said, a lot of these 5 star ratings must be from individuals that are either brand new to USAA and have recently drank the Kool-Aid, or are not on the phone and possibly in management. Your overall job satisfaction really depends on what you do there. I\u2019ll give it 3 stars to show some balance because your experience differs greatly from member contact to non-member contact, and management. First off, USAA is just like anywhere else. It\u2019s not so much what you know but who you know. A degree may help in some cases, but there were plenty of individuals in leadership positions without one. I also saw a lot nepotism over the years. Managers, directors, and even higher level executive management often hired their friends or colleagues from previous jobs and insulated themselves. A lot of the time it just comes down to who the hiring manager wants and the interviews were just a formality. That\u2019s nothing unique to USAA. As for being a member contact employee, I would say it\u2019s not as good as it used to be. It\u2019s more about metrics as opposed to actually helping the member.

If you start out a \"process-manager\" instead of a \"people-manager\" you're bound to have a less crazy-making experience, but most of those positions and departments are located in San Antonio. Promotion and mobility here are not based on merit. They can't measure merit because, roughly every quarter, they change the way they measure and evaluate performance. Therefore promotions are essentially based on an interview process wherein the applicant sells themselves in the correct format. This is a place that, in all earnest, encourages its employees to \"drink the kool-aid,\" which I find to be a pretty harrowing reference to an event that resulted in the deaths of almost 1000 people. They continue to wave this banner even after that fact has been brought to their attention. I moved through a member-contact call center position, to a \"supervisor\" position, to management in the course of 2 years, which is not common. I think I managed to avoid a large amount of brainwashing by moving so quickly and that's why I couldn't make a career out of this place. Getting to management is \"the dream\" for most call center employees, and once there I certainly learned a lot. You have autonomy and are tied to a desk less.

Very nice, newly renovated campus. Benefits are stellar, culture is decent (there is a group for EVERYTHING as they are trying to get onto Diversity and Inclusion radar). Loved my coworkers, love USAA as a company and I'll be keeping my products, but would NOT recommend working in the claims department to my worst enemy. Everything is very disorganized. Before I left, people started to figure out that the new hires (with 0 experience) were making more than current, tenured employees. After everyone became outraged, management came out and said everyone's pay is getting reviewed and has been for a while (they decided to start with the new people AND not tell anyone this was happening) and that this happens at every single company, we are lucky they are telling us; oh by the way, please don't jump ship. This is a common theme, there were huge issues with IT. After decisions were made, employees would find out later (already outraged with all of the issues) with no communication. Otherwise the job and expectations of you are inconsistent. It is an inbound call center. You are expected to maintain 70% adherence by taking non stop inbound calls (you are the \"catch all\" so there are lots of transfers you take and make), complete THOROUGH investigations of claims (the fun part, really), make outbound calls on your new claims and pending list, and manage your desktop/diary.

My entry level position was grueling. Non-stop inbound calls and claim handling. I was able to advance into injury, where work was lighter and more analytical. However, due to various changes in company structure, new responsibilities were placed and micromanagement on meeting phone stats, and numbers was a priority. Not a bad place to work if you enjoy the benefits, flexibility and time off. Apparently, it's the best place to work in claims. However, I wouldn't recommend a career in front-facing claims for very long. I've applied various times and landed several interviews in their more interesting departments: IT, Marketing, business, etc. However, there's either never enough positions, or they really want claims personnel to remain in claims. It's hard to get out of the department, or to land a position elsewhere, even if you have years of external experience in other areas. Company culture is great, and the mission-driven mentality is very notable. The volume of claims seems a bit high, although I do not have anything to compare it to as my prior experiences are in other industries. Hard to root yourself in a team or an environment for long. I've changed management about 5 times in 3 years. Not always a bad thing, but when you are asked to adhere to personal preferences in management styles rather than department wide protocols it can be daunting, especially when changes occur so frequently.

Years ago USAA was the company to be insured with and to work for. The truth of the matter is when they opened membership up they didn't anticipate growth on this level. It has ultimately destroyed their standard and quality of service. Basically just a call center where you are chained to your phone, you can expect to receive non-stop inbound calls all day and no opportunity to ever work your own files unless you work overtime. Biggest member complaint \"I can never reach my adjuster.\" They hire classes back to back to back because as soon as they get one on the floor another group is quitting. If you have prior claims experience working here will disappoint you as you cannot thoroughly adjust your own files due to the heavy inbound call volume. If you don't have prior claims handling experience you'll be devastated because this job will make you feel like a constant failure. It's sad to see so many people willing to quit their jobs, some even relocate to the area to work here only to find out this ugly truth when it's too late. The training is pathetic and truly will not equip you to be a quality claims adjuster...because they just need you to answer the phone and wing it. There is no real opportunities for growth. They don't promote the most qualified candidates. Also very \"clique\" orientated you even see this amongst the managers.

The whole empowering the employee is a nice thought but when mistakes are made and errors are completed that cause delays in the whole process. DONT FIX NOTHING IF YOUR NOT SUPPOST TO! DONT BE INVOLVED IF NOT YOUR ISSUE! THAT'S WHAT USAA AS A WHOLE IS SUPPOSED TO DO. Well when its broke and you see its broke, even if you should not of seen it, wouldn't fixing it be the right thing? Zero loyalty to employees that don't conform perfectly to the STANDARD and who look for solutions to issues. The hardest part is being told your dismissed for following the core values. Just remember apply the core values with USAA in the best light, not a member, employee or business partner. So not to think this is bitter employee ranting, its just that the same core values I'm supposed to follow would of been nice if it was extended in the same fashion. The most enjoyable part is helping and speaking with members, who mostly had no idea what to do or what to expect next in the claim process, hyper-service is great if people know what the steps are.

I thought that USAA would be a great company to work for because of their history and placement in the Fortune 500, but boy was I wrong. I left a better job because I thought this was a great opportunity. Claims adjusters are really just call center reps. You take non stop incoming calls all day and the majority of the calls deal with transfers to another department or questions about their rental car. You are assigned claims that you must complete investigations on, but the company does not allow you to do proper investigations because they want you playing telephone operator all day. You will get an instant message from management asking why you are not answering incoming calls if you spend more than 5 minutes investigating a claim. And when your weekly review comes up you will be asked why you haven't made more progress investigating your claims. If you have ever had to actually file a claim with USAA and you wonder why you've never heard from your adjuster or why there seems to be no progress with your claim it is because USAA would rather have their \"adjusters\" transferring calls and answering random questions from people calling in. That's no exaggeration. USAA contracts out all of the actual work involved in inspecting vehicles and taking pictures, so don't think that this is a traditional claims adjuster position, like I said, you are a call center rep.

ConsEverything Questions And Answers about USAA What is the work environment and culture like at USAA? Asked Jun 27, 2016 Horrible .. first i wasn\u2019t provided traditional training . Then my manager quit. I got thrown in with a very large and overwhelming pipeline immediately with no management support.. once my team got a manger, instead of training and helping, I was constantly micromanaged, questioned, and was basically told I wasn\u2019t doing good enough .. I logged in each day with fear and dread of what was to come ..you are told to work one loan at a time, meanwhile getting hammered constantly with phone calls, emails, Skype chats, all simultaneously with members or co workers wanting you to help them at the drop of the hat..I was never able to utilize my PTO due to having an overwhelming pipeline .. I was truly disappointed in the experience I had with USAA because I was led to believe differently Answered Jul 3, 2020 It\u2019s very corporate, competitive to an unhealthy degree, closed off and impersonal. No baby showers, no celebrations, no birthdays (unless you\u2019re management.) I think that\u2019s so strange. No one is immune from a lay-off, or a job \u201cre-mapping\u201d to a different position, especially the loyal folks with good institutional knowledge and experience, in my opinion. Thus, it\u2019s an eerie, unsettling place to be everyday. To be successful here: You do what you are told. You only provide feedback that confirms what leadership is already doing. Have an idea for improvement? Unless you\u2019re an executive, keep it to yourself and get back to work. You\u2019re a number, they\u2019ve got it, and eventually, it will be up. So...yeah. It\u2019s not good. Answered Feb 15, 2020 How are the working hours at USAA? Asked Jun 27, 2016 Monday thru Friday and lately, Saturdays. Answered Dec 6, 2017 It depends what department you work in. If you are one of the many who work in the call center, there is very little flexibility. Policy services department is like a revolving door-so you will quickly get a M-F schedule. Policy services is open 24 hours. New Member Solutions department you will have to work weekends for years until you earn enough tenure to bid for a different schedule. They are open from about 6:30am cst to 8pm cst. You will most likely get a schedule where you have 1 day off during the week and 1 day off on the weekend. You will most likely not have 2 consecutive days off.
