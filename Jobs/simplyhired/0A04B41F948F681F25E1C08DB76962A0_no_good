On multiple occasions I have had to complain to instacart about negligent business practices. The first being that instacart assigned me several shopping orders that had already been shopped. When assigning orders, the app gives you access to customer information such as their home address for delivery. On multiple occasions, they gave customer information to TWO different shoppers (one of which was completely unnecessary). If I would not have noticed that the app assigned this order to someone AGAIN, the customer would have been forced to pay for the order again and I would have showed up to their residence without them expecting me. Please note the danger this could pose for shoppers; these customers have every right to be fearful when someone is showing up unannounced on their property, especially at their door with bags of unknown items. A customer could have pulled a gun on me or called the police for trespassing. I voiced these concerns to instacart customer support and they refused to rectify the situation, they even refused to reimburse me for gas wasted going to the store for an already-shopped order. Instead, a customer service agent ended the chat prematurely and would not provide a phone number. Instacart does not have a phone number available to speak to customer service, they only offer chat. I let it go. Most recently, I referred a friend via instacart\u2019s $25 refers program. I did not receive the bonus. When I questioned this, they told me they had no knowledge ...more 1.0 Delivery Driver | Florida | May 14, 2020 A company that values profits above people, allowing unethical bots and dishonest customers to thrive. The work as an Instacart shopper could be very rewarding. You start your day at any time, work as many hours as you decide, interact with customers, and help them with their groceries. many customers are elderly people who could not leave their homes, and is rewarding to know you could help. However, there are a lot of unethical shoppers who use \"bots\", automated services, to give them an unfair advantage in receiving orders, and the company does nothing about that. So, it is common for the most ethical shoppers to spend hours waiting, while the unethical ones get the best jobs. It would be easy for the company to stop that, but there seems to be no incentive. As for the customers, unfortunately, there are dishonest customers who like to order items (sometimes expensive ones) and then complain they did not receive it, in which case the company just blames the shopper. There is no way for the shopper to contest other than repeating \"not true\" to deaf ears. The customer is always right... Furthermore, unethical customers often offer big tips only to attract shoppers, but then just remove the tip after the service is completed. What does the company do about that? *absolutely nothing*. In times of COVID-19, the shoppers are risking their lives to protect customers, and the company does not offer any respect to the shoppers. Recently they offered to send shoppers a \"care kit\" to protect them from COVD-19. Upon arrival, the \"kit\" was nothing but a 2 fl oz. bottle of hand ...more 2.0 Store Shopper | Bloomington, IN | Jul 9, 2020 Has gotten worse since COVID-19 The job was never great but dealing with sleazy and ungrateful customers has gotten worse since covid19. I\u2019ve been doing this for two years, I\u2019ve done it in big cities and small towns and when I first started it wasn\u2019t that bad, but since coronavirus started the customer base has gotten really annoying and dealing with ungrateful customers has almost made this job unbearable. On top of low base pay and fighting with other shoppers to grab good batches this job has become progressively worse since I started. When I started their was bonus pay and you could schedule hours and they would pick batches for you. Now the bonus pay is gone and you have to fight with other shoppers to grab batches. Not only does the new system have shoppers at each other\u2019s throat, it\u2019s a driving hazard because your always looking at your phone while driving to grab good batches before someone else does. Believe it or not this is actually one of the better gigs right now. The whole industry has reached a new low and has just become a hassle to even keep up with. Coronavirus has brought these jobs to a new low and shoppers are treated like dirt more than ever. The customer base used to be nice and patient now COVID has brought in so many new customers that just don\u2019t get how this works. I used to be against making these jobs w2 jobs but hiring a fleet of shoppers and giving them vans to drive and providing them gas, an hourly wage, and all the benefits of a w2 job starts to make more sense in the CO...more ProsWork when you want, usually tips are ok. ConsBase pay is low, dealing with the worst of humanity( Americans over consuming), stressful, lonely, you are treated like garbage by customers and company. 1.0 Store Shopper | Phoenix, AZ | May 14, 2020 Deactivated accounts,lied to by support agents, and treats you like blank* I was a shopper for instacart before and during the covid pandemic. Which we all know was dangerous to be a worker at this time and yet I/we as shoppers put ourselves out there. Well given the pandemic a lot of stores had changed their hours which in turn effected us shoppers as we'd end up having to cancel batches. With this already happening and then their shopper app giving me issues my cancellation rate increased above 15%. I had chatted with shopper support regarding these issues and was advised that our cancellation rate would no longer be a factor due to covid-19. Despite being told this I once again reached out to support regarding their app cancelling assignments sometimes even right after accepting one. At that time the ticket was supposedly being escalated and I was told I would receive a call from that team. Needless to say that team never called and once again batches were cancelling on there own, so I started to ignore the warning emails as I was instructed by their support cancellations wouldn't effect us at this time. Their support team is also not only lacking in the amount of agents they have (both shoppers and customers have had to wait over 5hrs at times to get help) but they are lacking in their training. I can can count more then a handful of times that I've had to teach one of their support techs something new I their own app.....the one they are supposed to be providing me help with!!! If you are looking for a company that doesn't care about you a...more 1.0 Contractor | Colorado Springs, CO | Jun 23, 2020 Contractor. Absolutely horrible do not waste your time First of all they require you to snap a picture of every single store item you pick. that literally wastes so much time. As a contractor they do not pay for your time driving, shopping, or delivery. yet they want to impose upon your time with requiring you to snap a photo of every single item picked. I would have been at least 33% to 40% more productive if I didn't have to waste so much time snapping pictures. I worked for them for 1 day. my first day was my last. I worked for 7 hrs and 54 minutes according to the app which was the time spent driving shopping and delivering for 5 orders on 4 batches. My compensation totaled $65.03 before expenses and fuel. I spent $15.00 on gas and 18 on equipment the grocery bags they require and a cooler. so after I subtracted expenses I made about $32.00 for nearly 8 hrs so I netted $ 4.00 an hour after expenses. Trust me you will regret ever having worked for them. I do not understand the people giving them 4 or 5 stars unless those people are just not even bothering to do the math. Instacart is GARBAGE!!! They use any tips you rarely get to use your tips to reduce what they pay you. ProsThere was nothing good about this job ConsThe company is literally a fraud. some people realize it and some don't 2.0 | Atlanta, GA | Jan 17, 2019 Great place to work if you are in upper management Pros: Free Healthcar for permanent employees Stocked kitchen Cool building Cons: Low pay, especially for the current cost of living. Poor communication about policies, processes, updates. New company so no structure. Last minute with important information if it is shared. No parking at the building for some employees so company gets parking far away which adds about 20-30 minutes to overall time each way. They don't tell you until you are starting but that should be said during the offer phase. Cut throat about lateness but office is in a high traffic area, in the city with the worst traffic so it's out of your control alot. You'd have to aim for an hour early to be there on time everyday despite traffic which would mean a 13 hour day depending on where you live. The pay isn't good so most don't live in midtown or the surrounding wealthy areas. They are bringing in mostly temps and I've temped before but they emphasize that temps are not a part of the team. So you feel unvalued. Some vagueness around what it takes to become perm. Management doesn't have people skills. There are 2 higher ups that are cordial. The others, unless you are important, your greeting in the hall goes unresponded to which feels Invisible. 3.0 Delivery Driver | San Francisco, CA | Jun 17, 2020 Mileage pay is non existant . A lot of wearcand tear is put on my vehicle and gas cost money, so consistent mileage pay needs to be implemented Y'all had said y'all going to pay $0.60 a mile in addition to what we were already getting paid however I have not seen that in a long time. Also y'all threaten to deactivate my account because of cancellations however the app is not working properly because it's been hacked and y'all haven't seemed to have done anything to fix the hacking so a lot of the orders are snacks off the screen before you can even see them so when there is a deeson order you have to hurry up and collect it so it won't get snatched away from you and sometimes the order does not show everything that it entails which means it has to be canceled so y'all should not cancel somebody's ability to pay the shop because they canceling order ProsWork flexibility and meeting different people. Also being anle to go to different cities to work. ConsNo mileage pay, Threatening to deactivate accounts for cancellations, App hacking situation, Subtracting from my pay for add on's, And subtracting from my pay for a fruit, vegetable, or meats being heavier that what the customer requested. 3.0 Delivery Driver | Pittsburgh, PA | Jun 23, 2020 its ok When i first started it was great. i was making 250-400 a week. Now i'm lucky if i make even 20 bucks on a given day. the batches don't pay well anymore. the system sucks . some are $7 for batch with a bad tip if any tip from customer that will make 100 changes while you shop. & be 12 miles away from the store it self. Not worth it half the time anymore. the only reason they're so successful is because most people working for the company are desperate for extra money. paying $7 bucks for a 56 item batch is not worth it. they changed how much you have to spend to even use the app which has definitely hurt how many people order now. it used to be $10 purchase minimum now its $35 . some of the customers are just not thankful ,some of them take advantage of you. ,or screw you on a tip after you delivered the items. It's impossible to get a hold of customer service anymore. this company/app had great potential . the way they're going now. its horrible i had to seek other options for a second job due to the lack of orders . you put all this wear & tear on your vehicle to not even be paid min wage in my state. ProsNothing. ConsUnder pay, badcustomers, underapperciaed, you're expected to beat up your vehicle for under minimum wage. 1.0 Store Shopper | Alexandria, VA | Jun 6, 2020 Absolutely terrible Instacart is not reliable in customer support. They have poor compensation for the workers. If anyone has noticed they pay just about minimum wage so the salary varies in each area. Secondly, they are very inaccurate to show whether it's an apartment or a house we are delivering to. Third, they are quick to deactivate accounts. My account got deactivated for not delivering groceries to a customers door. After having a hard time finding someone to contact because I couldn't go through the instacart app, I could only get an email. I'm still waiting for a reply. I was able to find another link to request a reactivation of my account where I explained that I delivered the groceries. I don't understand why they would do this when there is a pandemic going on. I had a 5.0 customer rating and I've had alot of comment saying what a great job I've done. So why would I steal groceries. I have a 5 month I have to support with instacart as my only available income. Now they have put us on the streets and that is why they have a 1 star. 1.0 Store Shopper | Phoenix, AZ | May 14, 2020 Worked as slaves I would hate to say it, but working here was like slave labor. First they only pay you $12 an hour. They say its a part time job, but they will schedule you everyday and not give you a day off. You can give great customer service and get your orders done, but they will still find something to nitpick at you about whatever its speed or something the driver does. One thing I hate is they wanted you to have fast speed, but when your checking out in line with other customers, it affects your speeds and therefore you get coached. Get so many coachings and your pretty much out the door. Your scheduled to work a 1pm to 9pm shift and then expected to get there to work 7am to 2pm because your manager sechules you however they feel like it. Your shift lead who you see everyday and knows you personally doesn't make the schedule but the area manger you may never see does. If you just want to be treated like a number and worked till your body hurts, this is the job for you. Questions And Answers about Instacart If you were to leave Instacart, what would be the reason? Asked Mar 16, 2017 I would leave because of the Bots the oversaturation of drivers and when all is said and done after the covid-19 is over instacart going to have to pay a big price or allowing undocumented workers to have accounts for allowing the Bots because they're going to lose a lot of delivery drivers and if not they're going to be so oversaturated that they'll start laying off drivers because they have too many but they will get their due it may not be today or tomorrow it will happen and it's all because of the unjust treatment that they have for their drivers and allowing all these things to happen on their platform cuz what goes around comes around because they are allowing these people Bots and undocumented workers with fake accounts that they are aware of they are allowing these people any spots to steal from the honest drivers that are only trying to make a living I believe they need to go back to the old way where they assign patches until they clear up this mess and investigate because again they are aware of it and they're not doing enough as much as they talk as much as they say we're doing this and we're doing that they're not doing anything because they're not the one being affected it's just shoppers out here that are being affected and because of the unjust and because what they allow the Bible says there's a price to pay for all those things so yeah they might be getting rich now we just wait see what happens Answered May 28, 2020 I would leave because of the bots. They are stealing all the batches and leaving the $10 and under. Not only that, my area is oversaturated with shoppers. I\u2019m averaging 2-3 batches a week. Answered May 21, 2020 How many hours do you have to work to get about $300? Asked Oct 25, 2016 They recorded for me about 32 hrs worked and I made about 600$ in a week. So let\u2019s say 4 to 5 hrs a week Answered Apr 24, 2020 I work 5-6 hours a day, 4-5 days a week, and am bringing in about $600 per week. Having said that, I live in a major city. It\u2019s important to understand that your location is important to this equation. Answered Apr 12, 2020 What would you suggest Instacart management do to prevent others from leaving? Asked Mar 16, 2017 Get rid of the BOTs Answered Jun 19, 2020 Allow customers to request a shopper. Had several customers ask if they can request me as their personal shopper and they can't. And give enough time to grab a batch without another shopper stealing it while your trying to accept it Answered May 28, 2020 How does instacart pay employees? A check or direct deposit? Do they get paid weekly? Asked May 9, 2016 They always when you first start won\u2019t allow you to cash out early until you complete your first 5 batches. They don\u2019t even tell you how many batches you have already done. So I have no idea if you do two orders in one if that counts as two or one. They also only let you cash out your instacart payment not your tips. :/ Answered Jun 1, 2020 For In-Store Shopper Is Direct Deposit and if there was an error with the deposit they send a check. In-Store Shoppers get paid every friday. For Full Service Shoppers is Direct Deposit with the option of cashing out anytime by linking your debit card to your account. Full Service shoppers get paid every Wednesday. For Shift Leads Is Direct Deposit and if there was an error with the deposit they send a check. Shift Leads get paid every two weeks on Fridays. Answered May 20, 2020 Can you bring your child(ren) with you when you go shopping and delivering? Asked Aug 18, 2017 This company treats us as if we were their employees I can\u2019t continue working for people like this who want control of my life like either way people are going to find the addresses so why make such a big deal out of someone helping out.This company really is begging to look like a .... Answered May 29, 2020 For the people saying that Instacart knew their kids were with them, this would only be possible if you were ONLY a shopper (and don\u2019t also deliver) and someone knew your first name and last name and turned you in. There are no supervisors at the stores babysitting us. I\u2019ve seen fellow shoppers with their kids working multiple times and I applaud them. We have to work and it teaches kids. No one else can access your app so they aren\u2019t working for you. Answered May 23, 2020"
