Lunch break. A 30-minute lunch break from 2-2:30pm. - Generally* nice customers. You're more likely you endure uppity entitlement than belligerence or nastiness. - Low volume. Most stores average ~ 500/week - Paid time off. You get 17 paid days off (PDOs). This is sick and vacation. However due to work schedules you don't have to actually take each day when you are on vacation.For example, I took a 9 day vacation and this cost me 4 PDOs. - Maternity leave (?). During one year that I worked there four pharmacists were out on leave for three months. Their absence did not result in chaos. I don't know the specific benefits available. - Health benefits. They have cigna which will offer a discount on premium for healthy behavior. This brought a $400/month plan down to $200/month. The company also has employee assistance benefits (EAP) which pays for 6 therapy sessions a year. If you visit a therapist once and they aren't a good fit that visit won't count toward your 6 sessions. This is nice because even with the most expensive plan the copay for a therapist is $30. -Profit sharing. Twice a year in September and March you receive a profit sharing check. For a pharmacist this brings home at least $1000 after taxes. THE BAD: -401k match. They match 50 cents to the dollar up to 4%. -Salary. Effective August 1 2018 full time is considered 32 hours. All staff and floater pharmacists will work 32 hours. (Pharmacy managers still work 40 hours a...more ProsLunch break, paid time off, lower stress then other retail chains ConsLow pay, management issues, pharmacy culture 2.0 Cashier | Chatham County, NC | Jan 6, 2016 Might as well have been invisible I was hired in January of 2015 to work as a full-time 3rd shift stock clerk. At the time I had just moved out on my own and was struggling to make ends meet with just one part-time job so I was forced to take on a second job. I was told upon being hired that I would not be full-time, despite being called in to interview for the full-time position, I would only be \"promoted\" if I showed I was a hard worker after 90 days of employment. For that 90 days I worked very hard stocking the shelves and pretty much was allowed free rein to roam around the store as I pleased. For the first week I was totally lost, no one spoke to me or approached me and I got the feeling everyone was too busy to train me so I just straightened shelves my first week there, having no idea what I was supposed to do. The staff was, for the most part, very unfriendly. I felt like if I missed a day they wouldn't even notice. Guess what, they didn't! The schedule was changed one week, I was not called and missed a day, no one called me, no one asked why I had not come in or asked if I was okay, my absence went completely unnoticed and I was not permitted to make up for the time I had lost and at this point I was living paycheck to paycheck and sometimes going two or three days without food ... I really needed the money! After about a month stocking shelves I was placed on register for a few nights and it was quickly noted that I was very good on the registers. Before I knew it that was all I was doing and d...more ProsPlenty to choose from at lunch time Conseverything else 2.0 Food Clerk | Newport News, VA | May 19, 2015 If you value your sanity, do not work here The typical work day: Since I started working here 4 years ago, I was expected to sink or swim. At one point I carried the whole bakery side by myself for 6-8 months, despite my pleas for a second decorator. I begged and begged for one but it took a bad day in front of corporate to get one. However, ONE single bad day got me banned from working as a cake decorator (I was asked how I was doing and I said \"ok\" and the person kept asking me \"why just ok\" and so I said that I wasn't feeling too well. Because I wasn't all smiles and unicorn rainbows, I got punished for it.) I worked anywhere from 7-9 day work weeks and half of the time I didn't even get a lunch break. Even after moving from bakery to EVERYWHERE else in the whole department (often doing the work of 3 or more people), I was still forced to work 7-10 day work weeks even though I complained about it to HR. I started getting sick because of stress at work and even ended up in the emergency room quite a few times due to exhaustion, sickness and dehydration. In the past 2 months alone 14 people have quit. If you counted back from January, the number would probably be in the 20's. I learned that the grass isn't always greener. Please don't be fooled by the smoke and mirrors. Management has their own agenda, and they don't care about anyone but themselves often scheduling themselves off during weekends, but they have a problem if someone else requests it. I learned that management would rather not schedule the proper ...more Proshigher pay than most grocery chains, bonus checks, paid vacation and personal time off, cross training Consextra long hours, often working without a lunch because of no ccoverage, management without effective communication skills or empathy, lots of expectations but not enough people to help fulfill it, extremely high turnover rate. 3.0 Produce Clerk | Nashville, TN | Jun 20, 2012 Fairly good place to work but many pros and cons As with many companies, Harris Teeter has a lot of pros and cons. In many ways it's a nice place to work with a good atmosphere and most of the employees are pretty nice, but the individual work loads are very high due to lack of employees and hours. Harris Teeter has some excellent store branded products and often has great sale items. Local management is given limited control and it seems most things are micro managed from corporate headquarters no matter what the local needs might be. Expectations are very high and corporate expects everything to get done no matter what the work load while local management is pushed to see that it happens. No matter what you do it seems it's never enough. One of the worst things is that when business slows down, they start cutting hours with no regard for the employees needs or the fact that the same amount of work still has to get done everyday by somebody!!! Benefits are really quite good if you are full time, but part timers don't get so much but do receive some things like bonus checks. Part timers also get mis-treated when it comes to work hours which can be quite erratic. Harris Teeter hates giving anyone overtime hours. In my department most workers are always on overload, at least the ones that care about the job at all and try to do a good, quality job. Constantly shifting schedules are annoying and it's a bit difficult to get holidays off although if you really need certain days off for appointments and such you can usually get t...more Prosprofit sharing 2 times per year, good benefits if ft Consvery demanding work load, not enough staff, micro managed by corporate office 2.0 Customer Service Associate / Cashier | Severna Park, MD | Apr 11, 2018 Fast paced with little incentive and poor management On most weekends, grocery stores have every singe line open and ready to receive customers. Not this store. Harris Teeter in Severna Park, MD, was abysmal. There were weekends where I was the only cashier, with a line wrapped around the entire store. The store owner himself had to cashier on more than one occasion. This was due to the inability to: A. schedule enough people. B. Fire people who repeatedly skipped or missed work. And C. Care, even a little bit. This resulted in my own breaks being pushed back several hours, and dealing with aggravated customers one after the other. My complaints on lack of management did not go through and I felt invisible here. I made decent money but I was working 10-12 hour shifts with little assistance. This was also a location that had the cashiers loading and unloading groceries from customer carts (there was no conveyor belt). This only added on to the burden of the job. While this practice helps speed the line up in the short term, in the longterm it kills productivity. I would usually work up to six or seven hours before my break and by this point I had unloaded and reloaded hundreds of carts. I was tired and tense from this. This killed my productivity and put a physical strain on my body. Another major issue was people constantly calling out and or flat out skipping work. There were people who had called out or skipped over five times without any penalty. This put all of the other cashiers in a difficult position. We we...more ProsReasonable pay ConsLong working periods, poor management 1.0 Produce Clerk | Virginia | Jun 30, 2019 Beware!! Hostile Work Environment/Bad Management All Around From a customers standpoint you would think Harris Teeter is an AWESOME place to work but sadly it couldn't be far for the truth. Produce department is an extremely fast-pased job because you are doing the work of 2-3 people by yourself with no help, as well as trying to provide outstanding customer service at the same time. You are required to acknowledge ever single customer who comes within 10 ft of you; which is not a problem because the customer are pretty great. The problem lies with the management. They give and impossible to do list and then they leave you scrambling non stop for hours while they're somewhere sitting in the office or hanging out in the breakroom. When they return, they constantly complaining about your lack of progress and the amount of work that's left to do. They'll then step in run a cart or 2 on the front tables, just so store management can see them working then they'll claim theyre hungry or tired and go and take another hour break. Meanwhile you've been there for 4 to 5 hours unloading a truck, pulling in pallets and working as fast as you can to stock the floor. The reprieve you'll receive is when the next person comes in. That is when you'll finally be able to go to lunch well into 6 hours of your shift. Harris Teeter is very strict on no one getting overtime (unless you're management of course). So when you come back from lunch, you have 2 hours left in your shift with AT LEAST 6 hours of work. You still have to down stack your section of t...more 2.0 Produce Clerk | Clayton, NC | Dec 8, 2019 Sucks!! I worked part time at the clayton harris teeter for almost 3 years. For the first year I was a cashier who got average pay, absolutely no respect,talked down on,rushed through everything, was not properly trained, got as many hours as I wanted but after the first year they stopped scheduling me as much so I started doing their 10hour overnight shift 4 to 5 days per week and it was awesomes because I needed as many hours possible to save up for a new car. I was 15 years old at this point breaking multiple labor laws, working 40+ hours per week and getting paid as if I was part time. I got tired of having so many hours and went to their produce department where I stayed for 1.5 years and at first I enjoyed the job much more than being a cashier but that is when I finally started to realize all of the problems within management and how many rules were being broken. I have just ended my job there but prior to leaving I had been begging for more hours for about 6 months because I was getting less than half of the hours I asked for. I couldn't hardly survive and get my bills paid during this time (18 years old) during the summer we received a new district manager who cut the h*** out of everyones hours and left many people unsatisfied and poorly treated/taken care of. Then they dropped me and almost all of the other par time employees down to 1 day per week so less than 6 hours a week. I was getting ready to quit but there was one assistant manager who told me that if there was an ...more 1.0 Produce Associate | Matthews, NC | Jun 27, 2019 Terrible management, and do not care about their in store employees. I worked at Harris Teeter, for over a decade. When I first started it was a great place to work. They always used to say that they hired only one percent of applicants. We used to have plenty of help, great management, and were allowed overtime, if that's what it took to get the job done. As time went by the turnover ratio became absolutely terrible. So bad that they started holding in store interviews every Tuesday, because they couldn't keep people there. Basically anybody who applied, and attended the interview got the job. It became hire anybody who wants to work for us. No matter if they knew how to do what they applied for, they were given the position. We had department leads in the store who had little or no knowledge of how to run a department. The people that had been there a while, and knew what they were doing, knew more than the department leads. This would lead to conflict and turmoil, and would bring the store down. That means that the other employees were having to stay, and get overtime to do the things that the leads were suppose to do. Well this would not set well with upper management, because they would go crazy, if anyone got overtime. They wanted you to get all of the work done, with little to no help, but never get overtime. If you did a great job and did get all of the work done, in the 40 hours, you can forget about ever getting a compliment. Loss Prevention would watch every employee to the point where it would be uncomfortable. Basically customers ...more 3.0 Food Manager | Virginia | Nov 8, 2018 Staffing and lack of support from upper mgmt make HT a difficult place to work Despite HT's growth rate in the competitive DC area, a lack of leadership from upper mgmt and an immense understaffing problem due to (I guess) the high income areas in which they are located has caused HT to become a workplace in which they make it almost impossible to succeed. The pay is marginally better than industry standards (think: Food Lion, Safeway, Weis, Giant, and even Wegmans) but not as exceptional as say Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, or even Aldi. Marginally better doesn't cut it for the amount of work required/expected as a store-level category manager. Hiring process is the most ridiculous I've ever seen, sometimes taking up to 2 months to hire for simple PT clerk jobs. Despite immense growth rates, poor staffing decisions will ultimately do this company in. I was essentially required to work 50+ hours on a week to week basis as labor hours were continuously cut from my schedule despite the store posting enormous proit lines year after year. WHat this company simply doesnt understand is sometimes more labor = more profits. Stocking,, prepping, and providing valuable customer service are all things that require PEOPLE do do them, not just one or two guys working 55 hours oweekly. It;s simply an unsustainable business practice that chases away FT employees that make you money rather than wasting it. And I'm not just talking about myself, as I have been more than loyal and patient to the company despite seeing so many good employees walk out the doors for the last ...more ProsCompetitive pay, career advancement, job security, can be a relaxed workplace at times ConsPoor life-work balance, Dysfunctional upper mgmt, doesnt react to change in industry quick enough, poor staffing decisions/policies 3.0 Cashier/Bagger | Wilmington, NC | Jul 10, 2016 Good employees, horrible management Depending on where you are, your experience with this company can be wonderful. The customers can be kind, understanding and the employees all have a positive outlook. But the management decisions and pressure applied to all lower rank employees is immense and my personal experiences with management led me to believe those above me didn't understand or care what working at a lower level was like. At Harris Teeter I was told advancement was easy and you could climb the ladder as you continued to work there. I, personally, received the opposite. In my time at Harris Teeter I was never permitted to apply for other positions as my managers claimed they didn't have the positions open and never let me know when positions were available. In addition to this I experienced constant blame for situations outside my control, such as taking the fall for my boss in front of the higher ups because my boss told me to do a task which required me to step away from my other duties. My inability to deal with the pressure only made matters with management worse as I was required to keep myself going despite rigorous conditions. I often was left to fend for myself on multiple tasks within short time spans, often being pulled from one job to another without the ability to finish what i start, leaving those jobs to grow worse the longer I was away. I received no real appreciation despite the numerous occasions that I was required to do a job meant for two people because management decided...more ProsMeeting new people frequently ConsHorrible management practices Questions And Answers about Harris Teeter If you were in charge, what would you do to make Harris Teeter a better place to work?

Asked Jul 5, 2016 Between my drug test and the call about coming and doing my onboarding, it was 2 weeks. Then after I was sent an email saying to come to do my new hire paperwork where the date given as the 21st (I received it on the 28th - a week later!) I went and was immediately met by a woman who informed me in a not so friendly way that I'm \"not supposed to be here\". (fun to hear from a 70-year-old who was talking like you would expect the mean cheerleaders in an early 2000's movie or like in Mean Girls with the \"You can't sit with us\"). It was not enjoyable, and onboarding was going to be \"in the next 3 weeks or so\". To sum it up, highly unenjoyable - at least at the location I applied at - and takes forever with there being so much drama that it isn't worth it.
