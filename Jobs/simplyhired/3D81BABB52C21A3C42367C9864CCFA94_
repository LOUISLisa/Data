About Us Blockchain technology is now widely viewed as the next breakthrough technology poised to change the world of commerce, business and elsewhere in our lives within the next ten years. It offers opportunities that optimize transactions and processes and cutting losses due to inefficiencies and fraud. But currently there isn\u2019t any solution regarding the opportunities available to address problems this innovative technology has such as the social-economic cost being currently ignored. World Open Network, Inc. (WON INC for short) believes that a global community should be one that is open, sustainable, encourages diversity, innovation and thrives as it reinforces positive values to the world as a whole. Blockchain has laid a technological foundation to make this vision a reality. We\u2019re committed to create such a community and name it the World Open Network (WON). We will build a global blockchain community which creates long-term value for the community and rewards positive actions that uphold the community\u2019s guidelines around social and economic responsibility a social/economic. The open-source 3rd generation blockchain software we\u2019re developing is just one part of our strategy to achieve this vision, along with the network and exchange but more importantly, the community we build that will support this vision. The new blockchain will have significant benefits that address the growing alarm that regulatory bodies rightly have as rogue crypto companies are taking advantage of unsophisticated (and even qualified) investors who don\u2019t want to miss out on the next Bitcoin and yet lose so much to a market that is behaving like the wild west. By focusing our blockchain to respect the community, to uphold strict policies around AML/KYC and enforcing that the community is protected by rewarding social-economic actions that benefit the world, we believe WON will set a new standard in the crypto space. We\u2019re at Series A funding and based in Menlo Park at the corner of the Dumbarton Bridge exit on Highway 101. Our team has significant strengths and successes in virtual currency trading, network security and game development and publishing with audiences over 100M. We\u2019ve a great vision for the blockchain, cryptocurrency, community and platform we\u2019re creating and how it will solve real issues to change cryptocurrency on a global scale.
