Processor | Pensacola, FL | Jul 9, 2020 Worst Job I Ever Had Mortgage Processor - Worst job I ever had in my life. Unrealistic expectations are set from day one on the floor. Then you get in trouble for not meeting expectations. They threaten to take away your end of year bonus every time they talk to you about your performance, which is every week. They say 10 of OT per week is mandatory, but to actually get the job done as expected you will worked 20-25 hours of OT each week. Yeah those paychecks were awesome but my work/life balance was non existent. No matter how much I asked for help I never received it. They told me to keep trying and it would get easier. They told me to seek out help from members of the team, but never actually helped me themselves. They will say all the right things to you when you voice your concerns but in the end they won't turn off the loan factory. That's the one thing that would help the struggling processor, and its the one thing they refuse to do. This job is insane. Really. My first week on the floor my Supervisor and MPS (another lower supervisor) took me and another new person into a conference room to speak with us about the job and expectations. During that meeting they told us that we would fail at this job, but it's ok because everyone fails at this job at first. They said we could use them as sound boards when we needed to vent. Then they told us that during the previous summer entire processor teams walked out on the job. I asked if they were kidding and they said it was true. ...more ProsCampus Amenities, Benefits ConsEverything Else 1.0 Call Center Supervisor | Winchester, VA | Feb 7, 2018 Overall mismanaged with focus on company and not the employee Human resources does not handle employee issues, instead employee relations does. They pretend to be a confidential and supportive group but they aren't. They are there to protect NFCU from litigation for breaking employment and labor laws. They do not completely investigation employee complaints from both sides but deal punishment without speaking too the employee being punished. They hurry up and implement disciplinary action right before bonus time just to take it from employees. If you run the ER department your boyfriend is allowed to act inappropriately to other employees and its not considered harassment because it didn't happen at work. Lies and slander are allowed because if the person didn't say it to your face, you're making it up. Management does not support supervisors, instead they are blamed for things like attrition and not \"coaching to success\". We are under our managements direction and have to follow orders but once that direction doesn't suit them they blame everyone else instead of taking ownership. Management does not \"walk the walk\" and is under so much stress from the VP management that they are only looking out for themselves. They have favorites and pit employees against each other. Assistant mangers are allowed to act inappropriately and without any recourse, instead they move them to another department where they cause more discourse when they should be demoted or fired (like they do to other employees who are without a title for less).

In the beginning, I was extremely excited to work for a place that really seemed and felt as though they had it all together. It's rated such a great place to work for and the offering pay was amazing. It was far more than I had ever made in my entire life. I was interviewed by an assistant manager and manager at the time and the interview was slightly intimidating but nothing I felt like I couldn't handle. Navy Federal has a really strict policy on what you are and are not allowed to wear. Tattoos need not be visible. If you have any facial piercings aside from earrings, you do need to take those out. Nails need not be a \"distracting\" color or length. Blazers/suits are HIGHLY recommended. Some branches vary on what they make you wear but to be on the safe side, assume business attire at all times. Once I actually got hired and started working there, the training courses were pretty great. I really felt like I learned a lot of vital information as a result of the training process. As an employee of Navy Federal, you are expected to know almost everything (bank teller side, loans, credit cards, etc). You are expected to be a universal employee and the one major downfall that I have found working with Navy Federal is that it isn't always black and white. There's room for a lot of gray areas depending on members situations and circumstances which can in turn lead you to have to make rather difficult situation...more ProsMember satisfaction, benefits, pay, training courses are very informative ConsNot a lot of support, gossip, favoritism, disrespectful people, consistently feeling like you don't have time outside of work if you're working full time 1.0 Representative | Vienna, VA | Mar 16, 2020 An Old Culture With No Idea What They Are Doing Let me start with what is currently going on at Navy Federal. They are completely ill-prepared for the Coronavirus. Their COVID FAQ's state that the virus can mainly be spread ONLY when you are showing symptoms and possibly when you're asymptomatic. Health officials have already advised that is not true and there may be more exposure from people showing no symptoms. As the largest US Credit Union, they do no have the infrastructure for fully remote telework and are currently only working to expand the infrastructure to about 60% of their workforce - although all indications are showing that this will get much worse before it gets better. The only way that you are allowed to telework is if your are an essential/critical employee. If you have underlying health issues and/or are elderly you CANNOT telework unless you're an essential/critical employee. If this doesn't tell you the company does not sincerely care about its employees then this may be the place for you. Working at the branch is horrible - they are not closing any branches and not establishing precautions to ensure the well-being of their employees. Branch employees cannot wear gloves when dealing with the money and there has been no reduction in hours or branch closures. The only reason why this place is in the top 100 is because most of the employees have been there for 10-40 years and don't know any better. That has to be who they have completing the reviews. Which brings me to another point - the employee...more 1.0 Member Services Representative | North Carolina | Oct 25, 2019 Poor Employee VALUE System--- I don't want a star sticker- I want to be PAID The whole environment fosters false hope of advancement. An extreme push for more rolls with responsibilities and increased work load. No advancement or promotions unless your in a click. The pay is not good all and the terminology about the employment in the company is feed to you and not real. Prior experience and education is not valued in anyway that benefits the employee AT ALL. You are micro managed unless you have been there over 10 years and can get away with anything including not working at all. Veterans are not valued as employees including experience in the military. I have seen veterans with degrees and experience including staying in the company for years and doing an amazing job and be passed up for promotions and discouraged to advance into leadership. These positions are hourly and your micro managed heavenly on your time. The stress is not worth what your being paid. They saying \"oh this job pays well\" hahha NO you have NO opportunity to grow above a Senior Member Service Representative and still do the same Job at a pay rate of non educated, experience- terrible job title extreme work load and never getting the opportunity you deserve. They have mastered the art of holding you down and preventing you from advancing, getting higher pay working less to reduce the cost of work on you and continue to feed you and everyone lies along with expecting you to complete surveys and expecting you to value the job and leadership like they are doing you a favor. ...more Proshopeful coworkers ConsLow pay, No advancement, Over worked, Underpaid 2.0 MSR II | Santa Ana, CA | Dec 25, 2019 2 time is a charm I enjoyed learning new skillsets in my role as an MSRll with this company Excellent benefits, higher pay than most credit unions. Now for the negative, when i got back from living in oregon i received a call to come in to an interview for this position. I was told it was laid back and was made to feel as if this would be a great plae to work for me, however after a week into the role i slowly started to realize i made a mistake. I believe i asked about the volume of the branch and staffing in the interview but i might not have in this case i cannot say however i let them know what i was looking for which basically wasnt high volume with low staff which ive dealt with and left with a prior institution. Everyday became a nightmare lines out the door, only me and one other person on the teller side or by myself. And commonly the lobby on platform is also full and understaffed. Did about a combined total of 2 weeks (1 week cash training ) 1 week platform basically both computer modules...cash i picked up very quickly because its second nature coming from a teller background already, they knew hiring me i had no loan experience ect and then had expected me to know and handle all of the grey area regarding loans clients have in a high volume independently with minimal help and if you ask for help your reprimanded. I was told i was going to be let go or have my bonus taken away for my par because my rating was too low and i told them i was planning on finding other work anyways, ...more 4.0 Assistant Supervisor | Vienna, VA | Jul 9, 2012 Its a Credit Union....not a Bank Working at NFCU was the first real job where I had healthcare, access to other wide benefits, a yearly salary, and a steady Monday through Friday kind of job. Being a assistant supervisor in consumer loan collections a typical day at work would be running reports in the morning checking over employee progress the day before, setting goals for that day along with continued goals for the week, then moving on to observing employees while motivating them to do their best and working on side projects. What I learned in my position was what the expectations of front line management wanted, how to coach employees, experience what it was like running a section of 8-12 employees working towards a common goal. I also learned what mistakes of managing employees to avoid how to effectively counsel and track employee performance, giving recognition & rewards when justified along with handling difficult employees and enforcing corrective actions. I learned that as a supervisor there are many different types of people, each with a different world view and personality that you must lead effectively and that as a supervisor you will take 90% of the blame & 10% of the praise. Management at NFCU was reachable but sometimes felt that the open door policy was not always too open. Having said that, they were supportive of general discussion on employee empowerment and did encourage supervisors to create projects/presentations on how we as a consumer loan collections branch could better ourselves...more Prosbenefits, federal holidays, workshops Conswork related stress, workplace 'siloing, ' or compartmentalizing, some management decisions 3.0 Member Services Representative | Virginia | Mar 23, 2020 Not a Progressive Organization One of the things you hear get thrown around a lot at Navy Federal is that we make the \u201cForbes Best Places To Work\u201d list quite frequently. After some time, you come to wonder why that is, and who\u2019s being paid to write that list. Navy Federal is a decent place to work, and executives pride themselves on the competitive benefits package and culture of the credit union. The culture is toxic and only benefits certain employees; and not the vast majority. The benefits are great, the pay however is not a living wage, and the culture is toxic. I\u2019ve worked at different branches and let me start by saying that the recruitment process is very stressful. They treat you as if you are an external hire if you are wanting to transfer within the company. If you are not a military spouse they make little, if any effort to accommodate you no matter how excellent your PAR is. I was overlooked for positions and told so because a military spouse, not necessarily better suited for the position, was moving and had preference (and some are transparent about this). There are little opportunities for growth and clear office politics. The branches function completely different, and several things in the policy and procedure are left to \u201cmanager\u2019s interpretation and discretion\u201d, which is the reason why there is so much inconsistency (this is a major complaint amongst members). It is such a disorganized organization. Members know that the culture is if they whine and complain enough they can virtually ge...more 1.0 Researcher | Vienna, VA | Jan 11, 2019 Favoritism, corrupt office politics, fear-driven leadership, and resistance to change. Lead by ex-military/ex-government management and executives, Navy Federal Credit Union is bureaucratic, resistant to change, micromanaged, and saturated with corrupt internal politics. \"This is the way we have always done things!\" is a popular mantra within Navy Federal, and it shows across the organizational culture. True talent and innovative contributions are seldom rewarded; instead, they are often punished and relationship building is favored to nepotistic extents. Career advancement and moving to other internal positions are a matter of who you know, how well you know them, and how much your manager likes or dislikes you. Business units and departments are siloed across the organization with communication barriers and no collaboration. In particular, employees below manager level (at least in Marketing and Communications) are forbidden from emailing senior leaders/managers without permission from their senior management. Navy Federal's technology infrastructure is vastly comprised of archaic, fragile, and unintuitive systems. The fact that we still use IBM Lotus Notes for email and calendar management speaks volumes alone. Again, \"this is the way things have always been!\" Working remotely or from home is \u201cfrowned upon\u201d across the organization, even though we have the means to do so (laptops, company cell phones, etc.). The \"we want to see you in your chair working at all times during business hours\" mentality comes from now-former CEO Vice Admiral Cutler Daw...more 3.0 Senior Technical Writer | Herndon, VA | Jul 15, 2017 Contractor - No Guidasnce on any of their products except from very busy PM I was hired to do Technical Writing on process changes for the NFCU Mainframe system upgrade. The project was slow to get started so I was occupied with reviewing, editing, and distributing many sets of meeting minutes for meetings conducted by 3 PMs. Then one day I was suddenly let go - yes, terminated - with no reasons given to me or to my Consulting firm which placed me there - the consulting firm I might add was and is very good to work with personnel-wise and all else e.g., responsiveness to issues. BUT absolutely no warnings were given to me prior to termination. And again, no reason was offered by NFCU for my sudden at- the- end-of-the-day termination. No prior notice was given. When I tried to contact NFCU managers I was told I was not allowed to call there anymore - in very certain terms. The people I worked with were very nice - management is a little different story - they are all so busy that they don't even have time to handle their own affairs much less pay attention an employee or contractor. The first place I sat (NFCU indeed had space issues and were hiring people like mad) was in a very chilly former computer room - I was in this room for about 3.5 months - I had a osteo-arthritis painful knee problem develop due to the constant chill. Finally I was moved to another location and worked in a normal work area - not a computer room. So I take issue with the fact that I thought I was doing just fine - but then was suddenly, without notice or r...more ProsFlexible hours ConsCommunication between, in my case, contractors and executive HR managers - not the PMs - they were great! Questions And Answers about Navy Federal Credit Union Do you have to have a certain credit rating, or have good credit to be hired at Navy Federal? Asked Sep 9, 2016 They do check your credit but I have awful credit from being out of work due to health issues, surgery and other unexpected stuff come up. They still offered me a position and I'm pretty sure I have over $6000 in debt. They haven't told me I need to make arrangements with them or even brought it up. I was more worried about it than them! It may be different in different states or different recruiters but don't give up! I didn't think I stood a chance with my credit even though they picked me for the job. Answered May 25, 2018 We do not check credit score. If you have over $6,000 in accounts in bad standing, we will work with you on payment arrangements. Keep in mind that your job offer is contingent and based off your ability to pass this check. Answered Feb 15, 2018 What are some tips for doing well in the interview? Asked Jun 30, 2017 When asked what you know about Navy Federal don\u2019t only know it\u2019s a great place to work (everyone knows that). DO YOUR RESEARCH! You should know at least one fact about the company you say you want to work for. That goes for the position too. You are interviewing for a position and opportunity to work there. Give an idea you have a clue on what you are trying out for. Answered Jul 6, 2019 The interview was frighteningly easy, two people one from Account Services and one from Credit Cards. Asked basic interview questions and then they assessed my computer skills which was super basic. Got the job. Answered Mar 6, 2019 If you were in charge, what would you do to make Navy Federal Credit Union a better place to work? Asked Feb 10, 2018 More of an open door policy and come out of the office and work in different locations for a week or 2 every year so you remember the front lines. Answered May 7, 2020 Holds policy needs to change. Membership eligibility needs to change. Answered Mar 16, 2020 Is there paid time off/vacation days? Asked Jan 25, 2017 Yes but it is earned per paycheck and if you are an MSR it is harder to take off you have to plan months in advance and race to get it in as soon as workforce management opens it up. If you work certain hours, days, in a certain branch, or if you take on more skills that you won\u2019t get compensated for it makes your pool smaller even though they claim it doesn\u2019t. All you have to do is compare your time off calendar availability to someone else on your team at the same time and you can clearly see it. They try to work with you for trade with business or switching days with another MSR but it\u2019s not vacation time it\u2019s just you jumping through hoops to get time off to live your life or and don\u2019t count on being able to respond to family emergencies without being it being counted as an unscheduled absence....it\u2019s most important to the company that a call is answered. Answered Mar 6, 2019 Oh yeah they offer s good amount of time off earned but good luck getting approved for it. You must schedule sick days 2 weeks in advance...hmmm who knows 2 weeks ahead of time if they are going to be sick Answered Feb 27, 2018 Are nose piercings allowed? Asked Aug 18, 2016 Only ear piercings are allowed for branch member service representatives. Answered Aug 27, 2018 Yes anything is really allowed as long as it does not become a distraction in the work place Answered Oct 4, 2017"
