This is a job for a newer graduate looking to get exposure to the healthcare field. The providers are all excellent and a pleasure to work with and form a professional relationship with. 5.0 Contractor | Milwaukee, WI | May 12, 2018 Zoom is an exceptional recruiter for Embedded Software Engineeer Typical day at the contract was early start and early end time. At this contract, I learned a new DSP. Management was very good to work for, was not overbearing. Workplace culture was very good, with lots of friendly people. Hardest part of the job was probably the site, getting to and from. Most enjoyable part of job was working with a previous lead who had recently started at the company. Prosflexible schedule, good working environment Conslocation 5.0 Warehouse Lead | Portland, OR | Aug 1, 2016 Innovative and Exciting This is the place to be within the healthcare field. ZOOM+ is innovating and reinventing the healthcare industry like none other. This requires open minded big picture thinkers and hard workers-- this place isn't for everyone. If you like change and implementing change, this could be a great place for you. ProsGrowth can be great for some! management is open to feedback and innovative Consgrowth can be difficult for some! 4.0 Office Manager | Palo Alto, CA | Jan 2, 2016 Work Environment These people were amazing to work for and I learned a lot. Unfortunately I was laid off in fiscal reorganization or I would still be there. ProsFlexiblity ConsWork load 4.0 Nurse | Portland, OR | May 31, 2017 A fun place to work. A fun place to work, hardest part of the job was keeping up with volume of work, it was very busy. Change happens fairly quickly here and sometimes that is not a good thing. A decision can sometimes be made without really thinking things through. ProsNurse Manager is amazing, provides guidance, great teacher, very positive, gives feedback on how to improve. ConsWork on holidays. 4.0 Sales Representative | Sacramento, CA | Nov 19, 2015 Offered independent work enviroment Researched and sourced prospects. Calling program and set appointments. Set personal goals based on monthly quotas Successful at communication and building client relationships Excellent follow up skills 4.0 Team Supervisor | Portland, OR | Mar 29, 2019 Growing Fun Company ZoomCare is a great place to get hands on experience in the medical field with no experience required. ZoomCare is a smaller company and feels like one in the way everyone is so connected to every department. A smaller company does mean more responsibilities for fewer people. If you are prepared to stick through the growing pains, there is potential for growth within the company. ProsGood field of work, transparency from upper management, trust that you can and will get the job done ConsHigh turn over. Starting pay largely contributes to turn over and quality of employees. 4.0 Customer Service Representative | Decatur, GA | Oct 5, 2016 productive very enjoyable work environment. Nice clean work place. easy to get along with co workers. management does their best to help out on busy days. no room for any growth potential. Proscoworkers and customers Consbenefits 3.0 Courier | Media, PA | Aug 22, 2016 Steady work Steady work during busy season. Jobs offered by dispatcher and able to make your own schedule. Paid by the mileage and size of job. 1.0 Billing Specialist | Portland, OR | May 10, 2018 Employees are Replaceable Pay is low. Waves of lay offs happen every couple of months. Management tries to cut corners all the time which gets them into legal trouble. My advice is to only accept employment if you're looking to gain some experience, otherwise, look somewhere else.
