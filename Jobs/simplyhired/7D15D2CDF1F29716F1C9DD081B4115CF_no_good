1.0 Customer Service Representative | Hampton, VA | May 29, 2013 BEWARE!!! For starters this company COULD be a great place to work. However I have to admit, it was one of the worst places I have ever worked. I have worked in customer service call centers for over 20 years and this place is awful. They are hiring just about anybody for starters. Out of the 30 people in my training class, only myself and one other person had any customer service or call center experience, so they are training people with basically ZERO skills. So they are really REACHING. Most of the people they do hire can barely get through a sentence without using incorrect grammar or slang. I heard \"What It do?\" and \"Let me AX you this\" used in actual customer calls and used by my instructor. The training was pretty bad too. The trainer I had was not very good with his use of the English language either. Lots of slang and bad grammar. 90% of the place talks like they are on the street corner. Unacceptable from any standpoint if you are trying to run a professional business. He could not keep control of his class, I came to work on time everyday, and everyday 3-5 people would come in late and nothing was done about it. Sometime 15-30 minutes late and getting paid a full day. If I have to get up at 5 in the morning to get there by 7AM, then everybody else should. CONSTANT outbursts throughout the day during class. No respect for the rest of the class that wanted to learn and no corrective action taken. Once or twice they were told to settle down, but there were fiv...more 2.0 Inbound Customer Service Representative | Beckley, WV | Jun 16, 2015 Stay Away if you can from the Poor Management, and always feeling like you can be written up for every little thing even if its out of your control. You first start this job in training at 10$ an hour, while your in training you get an hour lunch and get to learn about the products and services you will be selling for AT&T. That is the easy part of the job. Once you get out on to the floor your pay goes up to 11$ and your lunches go down to 30 mins and two paid 10 min breaks. When you come into work you have to come in at least 15 mins early unpaid just to get the slow computers up and running or else you will have the customers yelling at you as to why they are waiting after they have already been holding. And if you work Saturdays you have to fight for chairs and computers because of the lack of managers while they make you all sit in a small corner of the office that usually isn't yours. Also you get back to back calls all day long making it very difficult to sometimes finish notes on accounts and finish your call script without sounding dumb or getting into trouble for something you didn't say.This used to not be the case before the made my center combined billing so now we get everyone under the sun routed to us. Customers are usually very unruly and vulgar but there are a few you wish you didn't have to hang up on just so you wouldn't get cussed out by the next one. I wont even start to talk about the other reps that I've had the pleasure to talk to on the phone from other departments.

I have been with the company for 3 years and have watched the place go downhill. The site director has changed 3 times. There are several lines of business, each having their own senior operations manager. Those managers change constantly as well. I happen to work on the Apple Campaign. Our senior Operations Manager currently, is incompetent and a bully. I have witnessed him coming onto the production floor cussing and throwing temper tantrums when stats are sub par. His behavior is unprofessional. He has also sent home every Team manager claiming if they weren\u2019t doing their job, he would and could do it himself. This was the day before July 4th. Nice way to give all managers a paid day off! He threatens and bullies the management teams which then trickles down. The Operation Managers are puppets. They follow the leader and try to convince themselves all is right in the world of iBex. Team Managers are forced to do their dirty work. They have to sit through management meetings getting cussed at and having their jobs threatened.

Had a month of training for AT&T+DTV whom pulled out of this site, then poorly crash course trained for 2 weeks for Frontier tech Support (FiOS, Vantage, DSL, POTS), and soon to be Walmart Customer Service. Its a lackluster job at best, and pay is ok for the type of work. The people you meet and work with are pretty alright. Regardless of what your Supervisor tells you(you'll go threw at least 2 of then a year if not more.) they're not there for you or to assist you in any way with excelling unless you hangout with them on breaks and lunch and relate with them(kiss major but or blow them) you're gonna get the short end of the stick on everything, and have a very difficult time with in the company. Most of them haven't a clue on the basics of ledership or common knowledge of basic things in the company like dental and health plans and where to find that information, and just the job in general. The funniest thing is when you've got a legitimate concern on a customer account, the go to answer is \"just make them a ticket\". In order to get promoted within, you'll have to be friends with a large majority of the managment as its a favorites game here as they won't tell you that not only do you have to apply on the company website, but also apply threw paper copy collected from your Sup who has to get it from there OM.

Some days were quicker than others. after a little over a year I became a Quality Assurance Director listening to calls and grading them and then sitting one on one with the agent. after a while of that I was given the title of an Assistant Team Lead, This brought new objectives and goals which made work more enjoyable, and pushed me to be even better with more responsibility and needing to be an excellent example to others. I learned more about being a good customer service rep, being able to deal with difficult customers, being able to be a leader and an example to others. I was able to learn how to use multiple programs on the computer that I haven't used before. My great skill of Memorization came in quite handy with the survey script to be able to start multi tasking on the job and was able to use it for many of the years that I was there. The best boss I have ever had took me under his wing as an Assistant Team Lead, he saw my potential to get the job done and to be a good leader and example to other agents. My co-workers or the majority of them were all easy to work with. The hardest part was a while after the company turned it's contracts to TRG Customer Solutions Jobs started to dwindle, we lost good managers, and co-workers as time went on, we started to get less records to take surveys because TRG sent them to other companies in the united states and off shore.

I truly believe in the products and culture of the CLIENT. Now, I'm writing this for the big hats of companies that outsource and provide opportunities to other companies like the one I work for. After getting the contract permenantly, the energy for anyone not in upper management ( meaning the advisors that perform the hard work) began to dwindle and almost now obsolete! Why you are asking I'm sure, and as someone who is in the position to interact daily with all, the shows that are put on while \"the client\"is on site became that! Just shows!! Once the client leaves, the promises that are made, all the \"extra\" support. concern and coaching,contests and acts of appreciation disappear when the \"client\" leaves. Therefore leaving confused and disgruntled workers. And while the typical would say and agree that at least these people have a job, which is true,when you want people to \"buy in\" into \"the clients\" culture and beliefs, it's hard when the same skill set that is being pounded and taught isn't used for or with the ones who matter as well if not most importantly, the advisors. From lack of communication, system errors, incorrect information and no one wanting to take responsibility but rather put a band aide on wounds to temporarily fix things that simply bleed through or worse cause an infection!

IBEX Global is formerly TRG Customer Solutions but their reputation was so bad in the workplace they decided to re brand themselves and put in place four core values that they expect you to uphold but dont actually adhere to themselves.What does the acronym IBEX stand for? No one will tell the employees because it doesn't stand for anything. It's an animal that lives in Africa.

Working in the customer retention department for DirecTV was exciting, and every call was different, which made the days go by fast, and when I got to solve problems for customers, and saved them from leaving the company it was very rewarding. however, the management at this company (IBEX) was nothing short of horrible. there is sexual harassment on a daily basis, agents are treated so poorly, and the hours, or shifts that you are given are rarely what you will work. every day there was a threat about us losing our jobs, not for poor calls, or doing a bad job or anything related to the job. the threats were because of the insane mandatory overtime given to us. single parents were made to work hours that would be impossible, even if it wasn't their set shift. there was no working around it, no understanding, and no support by the upper management whatsoever. We were constantly degraded, afraid of losing our jobs, were never rewarded, and every day I walked in to that job, it was just like hell, which was very unfortunate because I really enjoyed what I was doing. I loved speaking with customers, even the ones that were angry, because 9 times out of 10, it would end well, which made me feel good. I even enjoyed the challenge of selling the programming, equipment, bundles, and meeting the numbers/quotas given to us.

IBEX Global in Spring Hill, TN is not only a toxic working environment, the place needs to be investigated. They just recently settled a lawsuit with previous employees where they cheated the employees out of money for time that they worked. Forget everything you see on their facebook page because they're sales people and that's all for show. In reality, they'd hype us all up for a fun day and when the day came, we'd slave away on the phones making their quotas while they went outside to enjoy the festivities. EMPLOYEES DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY OF THE PARTY EVENTS THEY CLAIM TAKE PLACE AT THIS SITE. In the event that said festivities are actually on the floor, they have a 10 min break and a 30min break to get some of whatever they're offering so it's not even a good time to socialize with coworkers because lunch breaks are staggered and you all go at different times. So, all of the pics on Facebook where everyone is having so much fun is the managers, training staff and team leaders. Employees are not promoted based on merit and performance.

Some supervisors are very high schoolish. They love drama and talk about you like you\u2019re worthless. Upper management think they are better then you.

Answered Feb 15, 2020 Very unprofessional and childish more like a club than a place of business. Answered Jul 25, 2019 What advice would you give the CEO of Ibex about how to improve it? Asked Feb 27, 2018 Fire the entire managment for nepotism and infidelity (they sleep with each other and give each other the bonuses the employees earn but are never told unless they are a favorite of the higher ups) Better breaks, counseling for people who get seriously stressed, a rehire status of good after a year, new office equipment (not just the lowest bidder) Consistent drug testing (more than once than at initial hire) If camaraderie is claimed, then show it better. Quit lying to the employees. If an employee has a drug problem, help with rehabilitation would give you a good person in the long run instead of looking only at the bottom line and how many seats are filled. Many good people(top level tech support agents) were lost due to stress and anxiety, which resulted in addiction. If you actually gave cares, you would assist in rehabilitation and give your own bottom line a stronger base of operations to excel than the dumpster fire you have now. Answered Jul 26, 2019 This is the 21 century Put money into your company and not your pocket. Equipment at Hampton Roads does not even have proper headset cushions for employees to use and equipment is shared by employees no cleaning supplies for employees to clean or wipe a desk, broken chairs and I got zapped with a keyboard in training that had frayed ends sticking out of keyboard. Employee rate turn over is high hiring staff is short and costing more money to constantly train new people who do not stay.

Answered Feb 12, 2019 If you were in charge, what would you do to make Ibex a better place to work? Asked Nov 6, 2019 Better training better management less favoritism less nepotism less school drama Answered Jul 11, 2020 Change the dress code. It is required to dress business casual except for fridays you could pay $2.00 and dress down. However, it is a call center and your job is to assist people over the phone, they can't see what you are wearing so I never understood why you had to dress up. For some people it is hard to purchase dress clothes, and it just causes them another burden trying to buy the clothing that the company requires. I mean most people work to pay their bills and provide for their family. So having to make purchases to buy clothing for a job where none of the customers ever see you is crazy. That money could've been used to buy food or pay a bill. Or I would stop the $2.00 dress down charge. The employee already bought the clothing to wear, why should they have to pay to wear it. They work hard 5 days a week for the company getting screamed at by angry customers on a daily basis over the phone. The agents help make the company a lot of money everyday let them have a free dress down day. Answered May 9, 2020"
