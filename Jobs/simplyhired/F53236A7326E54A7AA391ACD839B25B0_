    "Body": " Sr. Analyst, Threat Intelligence Coinbase - 4.4 San Francisco, CA Apply Now Job Details Full-timeEstimated: $100,000 - $140,000 a year Benefits Health Savings Account Health Insurance Commuter Assistance 401(k) Matching Dental Insurance Qualifications Blogging Presentation Skills Malware Analysis Python Full Job Description Coinbase has built the world's leading compliant cryptocurrency platform serving over 30 million accounts in more than 100 countries. With multiple successful products, and our vocal advocacy for blockchain technology, we have played a major part in mainstream awareness and adoption of cryptocurrency. We are proud to offer an entire suite of products that are helping build the cryptoeconomy, and increase economic freedom around the world. There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we assess whether a candidate demonstrates our values: Clear Communication, Positive Energy, Efficient Execution, and Continuous Learning. Second, we look for signals that a candidate will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, disrupt ourselves, and expect sustained high performance because we play as a championship team. Finally, we seek people with the desire and capacity to build and share expertise in the frontier technologies of crypto and blockchain, in whatever way is most relevant to their role. Read more about our values and culture here. Security is a primary competency at Coinbase, and the Security Operations team keeps a watchful eye over every aspect of it. Every day, we protect against some of the most sophisticated attackers in the world to protect billions of dollars worth of digital assets and ensure that our customers and employees can enjoy a safe, trusted experience. As Coinbase scales globally, our team is scaling along with it, using a blend of tooling, automation, and strategic team growth to ensure that we\u2019re well-equipped to protect the next billion users of crypto. What you\u2019ll be doing (ie. job duties): The Security Operations group is a multi-functional organization that includes our CSIRT, Trust & Safety, and Threat Intelligence. While no two days will end up looking the same, generally-speaking you\u2019ll be responsible for the following things: Tracking APTs and other threat actors targeting the crypto community and broader financial industry, and providing actionable intelligence to our CSIRT and security partners. Researching emerging attack trends, and uncovering attacker infrastructures and tools. Monitoring and investigating in-the-wild exploits and attacks against other crypto exchanges, determining attribution to a particular threat group, and working with our CSIRT to develop detections accordingly. Sharing your most interesting findings via the Coinbase blog, internal and external presentations, and threat reports. What we look for in you (ie. job requirements): Some security teams have strict requirements about certifications, degrees, years of experience, and things like that. Not us! We\u2019re more interested in the unique perspectives and expertise you\u2019ll bring to the team, rather than the acronyms on your resume. However, you\u2019ll be much more likely to be successful in this role if these bullet points seem like a good description of you: You\u2019ve been doing practical security things (detection and response, phishkit/malware/packet analysis, security research, etc) for a while now, probably in the realm of 5+ years You are comfortable doing malware analysis, in either static or dynamic environments, and have a favorite tool or set of tools you use to tear binaries apart You\u2019re familiar with Python and have used it for data analysis or to automate the task that made you bored when you were asked to do it more than three (or a thousand) times You regularly use OSINT or threat intelligence to better understand an attack or piece of malware. You effectively communicate your findings and analysis with the team. You\u2019re curious about how cyber actors operate, and you\u2019re determined to not let a broken dependency or sink-holed domain stop you from figuring it out. You aren\u2019t afraid to ask for help from your coworkers or network, but you know how to spot a rabbit hole before you\u2019ve gone too deep. Nice to haves: You would bring a diverse perspective to the team: for example, maybe you took an unconventional route to get into your current security career. Passing familiarity with blockchains and cryptocurrency. Working knowledge of ATT&CK framework. Experience presenting at conferences, blogging, or just talking to your friends about the security work you do.
