I traveled frequently, worked on large projects and had access to training funds. Unfortunately, business objectives change and the unit I was in ended up being eliminated. I had a fantastic manager and director. I believe that George Cope's vision for the company is solid. However, the internal day to day workings of Bell is chaotic. I liken it to being with a group of Alzheimer's patients - every day is new. Nothing you did yesterday applies. Some coworkers are great, most of them are less than mediocre. It's somewhat of a dog eat dog mentality. Everyone wants to save themselves (from being redundant). That is part of the chaos. Everyone's experience will be different depending on what part of the company you are in. Some have a terrible experience. Others, like myself, will have or have had a good manager that made showing up worth it. ProsWork from home, travel, training, good projects ConsLong hours traveling, frequent layoffs 4.0 Management Consultant | Chantilly, VA | Mar 11, 2013 A great place to work with opportunity to travel to several states throughout the USA, This was a consulting position working with start-up telecommunication companies in several states including Cleveland, Ohio; Denver, Colorado; Fayetville and Greensboro, North Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia; Landover, Maryland; Silver Spring, Washington DC. The position was varied which included writing technical documents for training of customer service representives; troubleshoot the timely processing of service order for connection of telephone service for business and residence. I enjoyed the job thoroughly. I worked in a team environment wich was quite enjoyable. Prosmet people from several states. 4.0 Recruiter | North York, PA | Mar 8, 2018 Rewarding and Collaborative Workplace From my experience at Bell so far, I have seen that the culture is one of learning, development, growth, hard-work (things move really quickly), and work-life balance. The leadership in my unit is positive and challenge each employee to see the broader business goals. My manager is excellent at understanding what additional responsibilities would help my overall career development and has helped me attain opportunities for more exposure to senior leadership. ProsCompensation package, growth opportunity, trust, collaboration ConsOffice location not easy to commute via transit, physical office not a lot of natural light 4.0 Telecommunicator | Arkansas | Oct 8, 2019 Great job, great people but lots of sacrifices Be prepared to always work on week-ends, thursday and friday nights to begin with, as most of the work hours are given at that time. The job is fun and diverse though, your get your car at home after a while and management is quite nice. Lots of autonomy but you need to be efficient enough and find creative ways to get the job done. It's a pain in the winter, but in the summer it's a real joy. Possibilities to grow in the company vary from time to time, it can be fast for someone and very long for others. Salary is cheap to begin if you don't have a diploma, but goes up quickly. I would definitely recommend it. 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Ontario, CA | Jun 19, 2019 Horrible and stressful I've been employed for almost 2 yrs. I had to beg the company to give me my vacation, the management is horrible, you're never getting a full 80 hours pay. The shift system is horrible, you would be at work and get marked absent. No fun at all just stare at your computer all day, can't even talk to your peers. Bell is all about gaining new customers and care less about their slaves (employees). ProsGood customers ConsHorrible shifts, short hours, unapproved vacation 5.0 Boucher (H/F) | Delaware | Sep 6, 2012 Entreprise tres favorable aux conditions de travail Une entreprise fiable,jai passÃ©s de super momment dans cette entreprise. rendement facile pour moi car je suis tres organisÃ©.Certains chef faisait du harcement et d autres etait vraiment sociable.collegues de travail (esprit d equipe)apres une rude journee de travail aller aider un autre atelier pour qu il puisse aussi rentrer plu ou moin a l heure. l ambiance de travail etait au rendez vous Proscondition de travail Consles humeurs des chefs 5.0 Substitute Teacher | New York State | Sep 6, 2018 I just had worked as a substitute teacher at this school. The school environment was warm like family and productive. I have learned a lot from this school such as classroom management, their academic contents, staff cooperation. It was really good experience for me. After those periods, I could work productively at different charter schools such as at Lighthouse Academy in Bronx, and Global Community Charter school in Manhattan. 1.0 Technical Support | Tempe, AZ | Jan 12, 2019 I hated working at Bell Working for Bell was bad. The pay was low, the call center was trashy. The chairs were practically falling when I worked there. They pushed sales very hard. So much so, even if you reseloved the customers issue and they loved you for it, if you didn't sell or get them to upgrade their service, they considered it a fail. I worked there for 3 months and I quit. ProsNone ConsForced sales, meat grinder call center 5.0 Account Manager | Ontario, CA | Jun 21, 2018 Good place to work at I have been working at Bell Canada full-time (More than 8 years) Pros Lots of room for growth. Strong executive leadership. Invest in their people continuously. Good benefits. Always challenged to be better and think different Cons The industry is always evolving and can be challenging to stay ahead of curve to beat the competition. Not enough hours in a day to get the work done, so sometimes need some overtime. 5.0 Network Specialist | Kentucky | Jul 11, 2018 Fun and Learn Bell mobility has a very professional environment at the same time, the team in the Atlantic region was most fun to work with. Apart from technical challenges all in all it was experience of a lifetime at Bell that I will never forget. The utmost respect and support I received from my peers and leaders is second to none.
