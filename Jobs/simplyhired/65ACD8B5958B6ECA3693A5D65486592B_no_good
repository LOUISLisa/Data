My commute from Tampa to Clearwater was anywhere from 2 to 4 hours round trip, and I was originally only working 6 hours. Getting my schedule changed to full time was a nightmare, and when that was finally changed I had been there long enough and been jerked around long enough that I was done. Balancing my home life and work life was difficult, as I spent the majority of my day commuting to work and being at work. The time I spent at home was long enough to eat and go to bed. I did not go out on my days off, as those were spent catching up on household duties like laundry and dishes. The compensation was mediocre. For the first 30 days, I was paid minimum wage, then $9/hr during the second month, and from the third month onward I was making $10/hr. The level of education did not matter, and the only way to get a raise was to get a promotion, and even then the most I'd heard of a pay increase was $2. I wish I could say the benefits made up for that, but those fell short as well. In order to take advantage of my employee discount for the campaign I represented, I had to meet or exceed the minimum stat requirements for my calls, and I firmly believed in delivering customer service, not delivering an excellent call to Quality Assurance. The fact that I had to meet expectations in order to use my employee discount was incredibly frustrating, and one of the factors that led to me leaving the company. The co...more Pros2 half hour breaks Cons9 hour shifts (including the 2 breaks), but they want 12 hour availability, benefits not worth the time 2.0 Operations Manager | Aurora, CO | Oct 6, 2019 Poor support for good managers. Unethical leadership. Worked here for 4 years and developed great skills. As a front line agent, I was successful. I came to work on time, did my job well, avoided interaction with office drama and went home. I performed well, learned something new everyday, adjusted to change (sometimes unfair and/or inconvenient) but observed and retained tips and tricks for dealing with software/hardware/seating/scheduling issues. I never received a write-up as an agent (which is absolutely unheard of within this company's overall culture), but found myself terminated within months of my first write-up. At the time of my termination I had dedicated myself to the company for 4 years, and was a respected Operations Manager, with a team successfully meeting or exceeding client exepections. Promotions are available to those who will accept additonal responsibilities without complaint and have the ability to appear to perform said responsibilities effectively. New managers must be able to perform without significant supervision, mentoring or meaningful support from superiors. Most Team Leaders and Operations Managers are ill-equipped to deal respectfully with people from all walks of life and have wrong-minded motivation for wanting to manage. Few managers take the responsibility they have to those below them seriously, to ensure employees are supported in making their work smoothly coexist with their life. The company will recognize and use skills of those equipped to manage people, but ...more ProsGood place to learn how to work under pressure, Some managers are supportive (against the overall grain of the organization) ConsHeavy-handed attendance policies, Poorly mentored managers, Unethical business practices 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Mesa, AZ | Dec 17, 2018 Job is effortless So the job culture depends on your location and which department you are in. Some departments are more strict/relaxed. Some departments pay more than others and the hours vary. The atmosphere is relaxed dress is casual. Mesa says there is a dress code but I've seen people in the shortest of shorts and dirty/unprofessional outfits. I'm sure it just depends on your department and management Most people stay because it is really easy. Its not a hard job and it doesn't take much to excel. The egos in management need to calm down I mean alot of them are young and they should be proud of themselves for moving up but the ego is what causes they spread of out of date information because you believe you know everything. The hiring process is super relaxed they just mass hire and hope the terrible people quit but this job is easy and in Mesa the pay is much better than what other places pay even though it doesn't match the cost of living. And the probationary pay is insulting especially to those with experience. Unfortunately some training groups aren't as good as others so you may spend some time fixing new hire mistakes it can be frustrating. I've worked some shifts were non of the TLs answer questions that can be annoying. I've worked some shifts were there weren't available computers and I was expected to wait around but because I can't clock in without a computer I don't really get paid.

Yes there are days where there are limited number of tickets to work on but still they want you to reach your daily quota (80 tickers for a whole shift for 200 agents and you are expexted to solve 4/hour) Management really like to SHOUT, be it good and specially when something bad happens. In training you will learn alot but not with the account you will handle but with the \"PINs, TAGs, Company events then they cram you on the last fews days of training after training they expect you to know everything already. Also training materials are out dated dosnt even have sample accounts. Then you have the SME some are very knowledgeable but most are crazy rude even when you just finish training they'll just ask you did you learn this during training? But since training is outdated you end up asking them... Some TLs are inexperience and lacks leadership skills and acts very BOSSY (ALL WAYS CAPSLOCK) even on your rest days you'll feel the stress since they send you msgs. You rarely get to see managers but when you do be carefull not the friendliest or approchable. And when they are around you will fill the tension and pressure also from the other agents. HR lacks personnel thus alot of paper works are delayed some got their atm on their 2 to 3rd month of working. The company also lacks proper monetary compensation... Rather they will give ...more ProsPros-akit ng ulo ConsDont work here 3.0 Customer Service Representative | Aurora, CO | Jun 28, 2016 You can meet some fun people but... I was generally disappointed by my experiences working for this company. I was initially contacted by a recruiter regarding a position that paid $15/hr. When I called back for more information they told me the only campaign hiring started at $8 and if I made it 90 days I could get up to $9. They called again a few days later offering a position at $12. I went in for one of the shortest interview processes of my life then went into three weeks of training at $8/hr. Once training completed, the pay went to $12. My biggest complaint was with scheduling. I went from working midday, to early morning, then to afternoons, to nights. The evening to night change was given with almost no notice. My next biggest complaint is around pay and promotions. The campaign I worked on had different levels of support for the phone agents, but there is no increase in pay for doing the extra training and taking on the more difficult cases. Then when the campaign expanded to include other tiers, with higher pay, existing agents were excluded from applying for those positions, the were only offered to new hires and people applying from other campaigns. Multiple promotions were handed out for SDs and TLs based not off of any interview process, or qualifications, but the fact that the person was \"good friends\" with or dating someone management liked. The working environment wasn't terrible, but this is a company more concerned with who you know as opposed to what you know. ProsSome of my coworkers, some of the customers I worked with, especially internationally ConsFavoritism, nepotism, no holiday pay, next to impossible to earn/use PTO, never received campaign benefits 2.0 Customer Service Representative | Aurora, CO | Aug 6, 2019 Cheap Canadian Company Cheap Canadian company that doesn't even honor the most basic American corporate culture, such as paying you for Christmas and Thanksgiving off, even though they are closed. No Memorial or Labor days off, that's for sure! You start earning ETO vacation time from the day you start, but it is not released to you to use til your yearly anniversary date each year, and vacation time will never increase over time, like most companies. It also is not paid out to you if you leave job, or are laid off, before your anniversary date. I had about 40 hours accrued, but left 3 months before anniversary date, so didn't see a dime of it. This is unethical and should be illegal. They get by with it because they are out of Canada. Not moving there any time soon! No incremental pay increases for performance, no matter how long you're there, or how well you do. Have to be willing to go into management for pay raises. Have to sit at a different desk everyday, so can't customize your computer to remember passwords etc.This also spreads germs quickly. Never buy a pizza or lunch for you like most call centers do, to show appreciation. Instead do cheap things for morale, like give you an ice cream bar, or popcorn. BENEFITS: Not great. The most minimum they can get by with. Offer no benefits unless full 40 hours, though most American companies offer them at 32 hours. This is not a long term company to work for, but is by light rail, is a decent in-between job position, or starter...more 1.0 Call Center Representative | Altamonte Springs, FL | Jun 19, 2019 Great job it\u2019s just the company and the people who runs it. It\u2019s a really laxed job, I worked on the Lyft account. The job itself is easy, minus the few angry callers you get which comes with the territory. The Team leads are not really there to help like they should be. They are more worried about you eating and drinking on the floor and being on your phone then ensuring you are being helped properly. The options they have for help when you don\u2019t know the answer to something is Slak, which is useless because you are on the phone and need an answer within an certain amount of time and they will take over 5 minutes to respond while you have someone on the phone,which will then be counted against you because your handling time will be longer. They updated the policies and then expect us to meet the same requirements on the phone when your telling people no for money when they just completed an entire ride and not give a real explanation, causing you to get a bad reviews and then they will count that against you. Customers using the surveys at the end of the call for the experience with the agent is used against you because they will use the survey to express their negative feelings for the company instead of you, you\u2019d think they would not count it because you can see the customer clearly talking about the company itself and not you but they don\u2019t it still will count against you. After so many write ups your fired . Only think enjoyable is you get to listen to music on the computer during your shift. Don\u2019t even think about getting sick ...more 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Mesa, AZ | Aug 16, 2018 Total waste of time Bad Management, no consideration for work/life balance, no rest breaks to use the bathroom, sometimes worked up to 4 hours before a break, threatened with write-ups for using the bathroom more than 6 minutes over a 9 hour day. Management failed to give feedback when passing over people for promotions, usually only want YES people in supervisory position, promotes people based off numbers instead of quality of their work. Fires people for petty things that are insignificant and then labels it as un-rehireable making it impossible for former employees to find future employment, will not consider issues such as transportation and childcare in scheduling, changes schedules without notice arbitrarily. There is little enjoyment to be found working in a contact center, clients do not provide functioning tools to do expected work competently. Hardest part of the job was keeping your cool when being talked to with little to no regard for respect or dignity, supervisors will talk about subordinates in front of other agents who then use it as a way to bully and put down co-workers. All in all, this was the worst work experience I have ever had. I would not suggest any of my family members to work here, ever. In fact I dissuaded people from coming to work there once I realized what the environment was like. I left in good standing, found a new job with better pay and benefits. Worked out my 2 week notice and they still labeled me as terminated. Work here at your own r...more ProsNone ConsInconsistent schedule changes, No flexibility, no annual reviews or raises. 3.0 Customer Service Representative | Aurora, CO | May 21, 2017 Great Coworkers and management There are not too many calls during early morning shifts. They pick up around noon. You get two breaks, usually spaced out. One about 2-3 hours after your shift begins, your lunch, then your last break about 2 hours before the end of your shift. Management(team leads) will talk to you throughout the week regarding the quality of your calls. They will work with you on things that need improvement. Sometimes they keep you on the same target goal for a while. The hardest parts of the job include dealing with difficult or confused customers and dealing with receiving \"no\"s on your survey. The survey is in general asking about the customer's experience with Netflix. So even if you do give them great customer service, they may or may not take that into account when taking the survey. However, any no's that you are given, reflect on your work. Your team leads will listen to these \"no\" calls and find what could have possibly gone wrong with your phone call. Something worth mentioning is that it's VERY difficult to get a day you need off for emergencies. They're very strict with schedules and will stick to them 100%. So if you don't have PTO, VTO or it's your day off, good luck. They also have a very strict tardy policy. You can't be a few min late (we're talking less than 5 here) or it counts against you. After a couple of tardies, you could face some serious consequences. Most terminations are actually due to tardiness or absences. Prosgreat people, very streamlined workflow, some down time Consstrict tardy and time off policies, survey, difficult customers 3.0 Customer Service Representative | Mesa, AZ | Feb 2, 2019 I loved it at first, but they have become very careless I loved this job, I would have had no complaints a year ago. After awhile, they started making changes, the turn over rate started increasing and they stopped caring about the well-being and lives of their employees. Maybe the client we worked for became more strict or just all the management they fired. They would work with a schedule for you, at least something consistent. Nowadays, its like employees are expendable. They claim that you will have a set schedule, but now it changes weekly and your days off and hours change without notice. I have tried to work with them and get my previous hours back, but they said it didn't matter and they can change my hours whenever. I tried changing to a better department, but they never let me for a year even though they claim you can. They say they never have enough people and you cant change over to a better department until then. Well its been a year and the turnover rate just gets progressively worse. I came back after a short leave and I didnt even recognize anyone who worked there. Everyone left, even supervisors and long time, dedicated employees left. I am sad to say I am going to leave because it used to be wonderful. I would only suggest this job if you are someone who likes to feel expendable or taken advantage of. Only apply if you need something temporarily till you find something better.

From the bottom to the top, everyone seems to care about each other's well being, and reports of harrassment are taken very seriously and always acted upon.

Asked Sep 22, 2016 Spent about 3 hours in the building testing and doing interviews. Made me late for another appointment I had. Sent me home with another test to do. The link in the email was a 404 error... They seem to interview people all day as there was a non-stop line of people being tested and interviewed. Probably had something to do with why it took so long. Lots of people ahead of me when I left and there were still people coming in as I was leaving. Tests are easy, scored high on all of them. Things like WPM, Grammar, English Comprehension, etc. They're easy. If you've been using the internet since 2004, you're probably gonna pass these tests. Answered Oct 19, 2019 I arrived to my interview on time. The first thing I did was fill out a sheet with my basic info, work experience, and availability. I completed it and gave it back to one of the ladies at the front desk. She looked at my availability and immediately rejected me because my school schedule wouldn't fit with their work schedule. First of all, why couldn't they tell me that before I wasted my time and came in? And second, it's a 24-hour company... How are there no hours for my availability???
