It was good pay, people and hours were good as well. There is always room to move up if you wanted to do something more like recruiting. 1.0 Insurance Agent | Tracy, CA | Sep 15, 2019 Stay away from this place Miserable place to work. Co workers will take advantage of u. Pay is garbage. Hours are garbage. Up-tight environment. No room for moving up. Stingy/Greedy management. ProsNothing Consbasically everything 4.0 Administration Manager | Tracy, CA | Dec 29, 2016 Great Place Great environment and Boss it the best. looking for a place that you want to be extremely successful this place is it. Going to miss this place and everyone here 4.0 Payroll Specialist | Atlanta, GA | Mar 16, 2012 Great Entry Level Job I enjoyed working for this company. I was trained on their software and I didn't feel rushed. I got all the help I needed. Small company, slow paced. Prossmall company, you get to know everyone. Consunattractive benefit, . dead end job, and hard work goes unnoticed. 1.0 Sales Representative | Modesto, CA | Oct 1, 2019 Do NOT Work Here They put their employees in very unsafe and uncomfortable situations. You are required to go to customer\u2019s homes at all hours of the night: 11pm, midnight, 1:30am! When I complained to a supervisor I was told \u201cI had to be at a customer\u2019s home at 12:30am and had no problems. If you don\u2019t like it you don\u2019t have to work here!\u201d This day in age, you never know if what kind of home you\u2019re walking into. When you are a female going to a married man\u2019s home at midnight and his wife comes out of the bedroom wondering why there\u2019s a females voice in the house that late at night, it\u2019s not a comfortable situation. ProsAnnual Sales meetings IF you sell certain amount of policies ConsGoing to customer\u2019s homes at all hours of the night 1.0 General Manager | Tracy, CA | Aug 12, 2018 Management does not follow through on committments What is promised and what is practiced are two separate entities. Some of the management is unethical. Professionalism has 2 sets of standards for men vs women. 5.0 Benefits Coordinator | Fremont, CA | Jul 17, 2018 Great Company & Great Opportunities I truly enjoy working for The Hart Group because I am able to help people and have substantial earnings that continue to grow. Also, I have never worked for a company that truly cared for its employees and created a great company culture before The Hart Group. ProsThe cause, The earnings 3.0 Benefits Coordinator | Tracy, CA | Dec 27, 2017 Unless your a sales person, this is not for you The Company (American Income Life) is a good company in general. The Agency that I worked at (The Hart Group) had good intentions but made some poor choices sometimes. I seems that the mangers at the hart Group favored women who wore hardly any clothing over anything else. Some mangers only paid for the women to get their insurance license while the men had to pay for it themselves. There were no office phones so we hand to use our own cell phones. Although it was nice to get free leads, often more or less, we would get recycled leads that would've already been called on. I was annoying to have to call the same numbers over and over again. If we didn't meet our quota, we had to stay till closing, which was from 9-9pm. We would've come in early the next day to get those last few appointment. Like mentioned earlier, it's not a bad company, it just wasn't for me! ProsUnlimited income, Rebewals Consno work/life balance, long hours, 100% commission 4.0 Physician Recruiter | Marietta, GA | Jul 9, 2020 Fast paced fun recruiting office They basically gave me my start in recruiting and continued to work with me for years off and on. They try to have you succeed and help in anyway they can. Would work there again. ProsEverything ConsNothing 3.0 Insurance Agent | Tracy, CA | Mar 27, 2018 potential for success potential for success. Friendly environment, culture. The staff was organized, the office was well kept and clean. The atmosphere was manageable. The manager was eccentric. Which is good I believe.
