It\u2019s not the worst place to work but they definitely have some improvement needed. The management only really cares about rate, they don\u2019t focus too much on who is working hard and who isn\u2019t picking up their own slack. I say this because I bust my ace everyday and the only recognition I get is a good job when they see the hourly rate so high. If they actually focus on making their employees feel comfortable and happy then they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about so many people leaving. They\u2019re constantly hiring people because most new hires or even temps will just drop the ball, it\u2019s mind numbing work, tedious and same thing everyday. The pay isn\u2019t bad at all depending on the shift you work but the thing is, you hardly get a raise and when you do it seems to be the same as everyone else gets, they don\u2019t keep track of your performances unless you mess up and pass a bad part, it\u2019s the end of the world, even if it\u2019s not your fault most likely you get blamed for things you didn\u2019t do. Some of the team leaders don\u2019t deserve their positions, just hanging out talking to people nothing work related and sometimes you really need your leader to help you with something but they will be no where to be found or on their phone texting which is totally frowned upon if you\u2019re just an ordinary team member.. management could use some tweaking. Not only that they play favorites ALOT, like if you wanna come in early for OT instead of sta...more ProsA lot of nice people to vibe with. ConsShort Breaks, No consideration, Bad Management 1.0 Assembler | Alto, MI | Mar 1, 2019 Bad Workplace The management is poor. Honestly, all you really need to know is that Magna Mirrors does not care about their employers. All they really care about are making parts. Making rate and hitting your number. You can only miss four days a year. Takes six months to forgive a day that you've missed. The attendance policy is very confusing, it goes by a percentage. I do not understand the attendance policy, even people that have been working there longer than I have, don't understand it. I have been there for almost a year and never have been to an orientation. You would think that you'd have an orientation the day before you start? I guess not that doesn't apply to Magna Mirrors. A typical work day, is very stressful. You never have an material you need to build the car mirrors that are on the schedule. The machines tend to not work. So you'll have hours of downtime. It's difficult to hit number when you don't have the items you need. One line that I was on, always had bad paint. Normally it'll be one tote of bad paint, I was sending back four to five totes a night because of bad paint. It was the packer's fault if you went down for paint. I had a PA yell at me, several times, that it was MY fault that I was down, due to having bad paint. How is it my fault that the Magna Mirrors in Newago was giving me bad paint. All I learned was that this workplace is not worth it. The only thing that would be worth it, is the pay and benefits. Other than that, I would not recommend this job to...more ProsGood pay, good benefits ConsShort breaks, poor management. 1.0 IT Technician | Battle Creek, MI | Aug 13, 2019 Poor management and they all treat you terribly So i got in as an IT Help Desk Technician with experience from the State of Michigan. Not once did they have any training for me other than having me be the lap dog following my co worker to work on things case by case, but only after a few days of that, and they expect you to be able to do everything, even if you've never had experience in that task before. The hot environment is bad, but i wasn't so concerned about that. However, i was concerned at how poorly workers were being treated by the higher up management staff. Maintenance techs who are terribly under staffed, and horribly over worked are being yelled at and even degraded on the floor. But with my experience, my biggest issue personally was the management. My IT manager would not help me to learn about new tasks that i had no experience in, so i would ask my co worker. My co worker was honestly was the only good part of this company. He would help me out as much as possible, then once his knowledge went dry, i was forced to ask the manager, who 1. Just shouts out the solution to it instead of showing you what to do for it 2. talks down to you as if you're stupid 3. makes comments about you not doing work when researching how to do the tasks he gave you I was constantly spoken down to. I had issues originally with Zebra printer troubleshooting because i had no prior experience. After working with them on multiple occasions, i learned how to use them and fix them. But when delving out tasks, he made a ...more 3.0 Team Supervisor | Georgia | Jan 9, 2020 Good pay and benefits, not much else. The pay and benefits are very good. Some hourly employees make more than office and management personnel, especially the skilled trades, and the HR staff is openly resentful about it. Management is very sneaky and backhanded. They'll make promises that they wont keep. They'll treat you like a subhuman imbecile if you're not an engineer or working in the office. HR actually had a man fired on a technicality because one of the generalists didnt like him from an argument she had with him years prior at another completely unrelated job. She actually lied to legal so he would be terminated. The general manager is a crook. He makes the worst possible financial decisions and places the burden of dealing with it on our shoulders by doing things like cutting off air conditioning in the summer months as well as keeping entire departments critically understaffed for months on end. He had a new cafeteria installed which is run by 5 star foods and has demanded that no outside food be brought into the facility. If you want to eat, you'd better eat from the cafeteria which is no better than gas station food and is ridiculously overpriced. The safety staff is a joke. They're so desperate to prove themselves relevant that they'll intentionally cause safety issues like spilling chemichals or opening flammable cabinets so they can take pictures of it and get credit for corrective action. Emphasis on metrics and short term goals is becoming the norm. Management is woefully inept at handling and ...more 3.0 Maintenance Administrator | Plymouth, MI | Mar 19, 2019 Open door policy? to bully you? And intentionally disagree with you? YES! I leaned some things while working at Magna! A lot of those in production, are new to this country and actually are very nice people! I will always speak well of them! Other than that, there are a FEW, I hope, I won't have to work with their types, that I worked with there with the likes of... extreme passive- aggressive behavior, and the one that says she never would throw anyone under a bus and.... that is all she does! And a boss that played games with me! How toxic! I can't get over how openly rotten people can be in a work place! And they are under their best behavior at work? My first week there, some lady from corporate was training me and the bus lady, and this woman relished in treating me like a fool.....because a was new and I was male? The open door policy might sound good but, don't ask these people for any help, that involves anything other than anything very basic! It will just frustrate you! The bright side is if you come to work and not expect much from managers and associates, you would be better off! The pay is decent! The company has some good attributes about it though, free coffee, frequent free food, good benefits and pay! Shift changes are chaotic, with many employees! The shop gets very hot even if it's in the mid 70s! It can be very cold in the shop in late Fall- through, late Spring! ProsGood pay & benefits, free coffee and sometimes free food! nice people! ConsA lacking open door policy! Some Toxic associates & management 4.0 Assembler | Plymouth, MI | Dec 29, 2018 So far so okay Not a bad place to work but could definitely use some improvement with their organization and placement of employees. There is a noticeable language barrier, which there\u2019s no problem with having a mixed culture, but when it causes confusion within the work place it can complicate a lot! Noticeable favoritism and competitiveness within workplace, brought on by fellow coworkers between the tail light vs head lamp areas, and it makes an apparent divide where there should be a solid team effort. Lack of communication, which can create chaos during work and cause things to slow down due to misunderstandings of requirements. I haven\u2019t been here long enough to observe an accurate judgement of management but from what I\u2019ve seen so far is that there could definitely be more organization, as I\u2019ve stated. Pretty laidback workplace, despite some of these minor issues. However, if you don\u2019t do well with working under pressure, then some of these issues could become major. This job isn\u2019t for everyone but it seems to be a good fit for me, being that I\u2019m used to jobs like this and can luckily figure things out pretty quickly on my own and adapt. If you can\u2019t adapt, then this job may not be for you ????????????????????????????????????????????????\u200d???????????????????????????????????? ProsPaid breaks, paid holidays, good hourly wages, good benefits ConsLack of communication, often on 6 day schedule, disorganization, miscommunication, favoritism 2.0 Operator | Holland, MI | Mar 14, 2019 They consistantly drop the top out pay rate and cut wages from hard workers. When i first started, they advertised that the top out rate was $17.00 after 4 years. After a year went by, they made it $17.00 after 5 years. After another year went by, they dropped it to $16.50 after 5 years. Then, they decided to take away the .50 cents and hour for people who earned certified packer pay, and .50 cents for people who earned certified trainer pay. They hold \"yearly benefit meetings\" to inform us thar our benefits are getting better and better, while they are actually getting worse and worse. In a world which the cost of living is rising, Magna thinks decreasing our pay and making us work harder is the right thing to do. Also... they dont pay attention to what kind of people they hire in. I find myself not only teaching people the job, but also teaching them basic math and people skills. If you are the type of worker who wants to take the easy route and not pull your own weight, this is the perfect place for you, because the senior employees working for retirment will always pick up your slack, due to supervisors and team leaders not holding people accountable. ProsFree pop and coffee ConsEverything else 4.0 Freight Team Associate | Lansing, MI | Mar 19, 2019 My Magna There are hundreds of Magna plants in the u.s. so I can only speak for my plant. I began working there when it opened and I feel it's always easier when you're there in the beginning. Management was much stricter about processes and rules. Management was so so but probably by today's standards that's at least average. If you want to maintain privacy this may not be the place for you, managers who wanted to feel like a member of the gang often joined in childish and inappropriate behavior. The original employees that were hired at opening were extremely dedicated so the strong foundation is unfortunately mostly on one shift. Our plant had very good benefits as well as profit sharing including company stocks. The pay rate was okay but it's not rising quickly enough and if an organization expects U2 work overtime two or three times a week they have to pay you enough to make it worth you losing time with your family or paying child care. ProsBenefits ConsManagement unwilling 2 make timely changes to building and production processes, Lack of forethought in terms of squashing concerns before they became problems. 2.0 Quality Engineer | Troy, MI | Jan 9, 2019 Supplier Quality Engineer - Troy Office My supervisor was knowledgeable, Global Director of Program Mgt and Quality. I felt I knew more technically supplier quality wise. He ran administrative issues Globally for program mgt and Quality Department. The problem with Magna is they are decentralized meaning every plant did what they wanted to meet Start of Production instead of one way of doing business in terms of Quality Mgt System. Every plant had there own way of doing procedures in getting to SOP. He was very hands off but did help when questions came around. He mentioned to me that the company growth was flat or Ascending not as Magna wanted. I offered up a lot for a Supplier Kick off Documents and Supplier Readiness for the PDP system. Prodruct Development Process. They loved my ideas about documents for kick off. He mentioned he would write me a letter of recommendation in my exit interview. The company never gave me a chance to fulfill my potential as a Supplier Quality Engineer. Prosgood benefits, pay Consjob security because of company performance in the market. 2.0 Team Leader | Moore, SC | Aug 7, 2019 A place of no organization Ever since I started working here , it was all good in the beginning but as time went on they have messed up paychecks by shorting people with hours . I had a referee that I could of got paid for referring them and they lost her application so I couldn\u2019t get paid . I have to got to leadership classes EVERY week at 6 am or top of working a 12hour shift . That means I am working 13-14 hours once a week . Management is NEVER on the same page . Nothing it never good enough . When you start hitting your numbers they up it . MPS doesn\u2019t care about ergonomic rotations . They only care about how many jobs they can cut to save the company money . We never can keep materials in the building . We are also suppose to have all employee meetings 11 times a year, I\u2019ve only been to ONE this year . HR can\u2019t keep up with who has how many points so getting the bad employees out of the building is nearly impossible. It makes the jobs of leadership hard because they think they can walk all over you with no consequences. I do no recommend anyone working for Magna Seating .
