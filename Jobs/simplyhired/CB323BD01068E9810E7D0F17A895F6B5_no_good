I star by having breakfast at the cafeteria, we were really spoiled, having everything we may want for breakfast. it doesn' t take long though, but it delights our day. I start the day by going over my emails and my boss s ones, organize, archive some answer or dispatch some. I follow up very closely the calendar, which is an important task to do. organize meetings that may include dozens of people fro different countries with different time zones and try to find a suitable time for everyone which can be impossible sometimes, but we make it happen. I also organize marketing events starting by the invitations, the catering and also the venue. it s so rewarding when a marketing event meets big success. I had wonderful boss, hard working, serious organized, and knows exactly what he wants and on the top of that very human. I really enjoyed working at BCG. Prosvery good trainings, free meals, nice team building trips Consmanaging 3 to 4 people at a time. 5.0 Senior Compensation Analyst | Boston, MA | May 27, 2015 An excellent work experience I really loved working at BCG.
