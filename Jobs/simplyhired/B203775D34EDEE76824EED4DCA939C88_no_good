No respect for drivers,dirt for pay,poor home time!!Don't say you were not warned google them before ruining your life!! ProsNone ConsEverything 2.0 Independent Contractor | Kenly, NC | Mar 21, 2017 I do not recommend While I was able to get my CDL through this company, the pay while I was there caused me to loose everything. I ended up homeless! The management/dispatchers were lousy. They didn't give the miles they said we would get, It was just not a good experience at all. 1.0 Over the Road Truck Driver | Cedar Rapids, IA | Jul 7, 2020 Not what I expected You'll have steady freight for the first couple months, maybe depending on you your dm, but after that your slowed down and constantly sitting days at time. 1.0 Over the Road Truck Driver | Cedar Rapids, IA | Aug 14, 2019 Not a place for advancement I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. The best thing I can say about them is they'll give you a chance to start your driving career, but they'll take advantage of you by under paying you. ProsThey'll give you a chance to start your career. ConsNot a job you want to retire from. 1.0 Over the Road Truck Driver | Cedar Rapids, IA | Aug 6, 2019 If like not working,this is the job for you Became a truck driver to make a comfortable living. Unfortunately you spend more time waiting for work than actually working. You'll deliver a load and sit multiple days, which you don't get paid for and spending your own money to eat 4.0 Truck Driver | Austin, TX | Jun 26, 2017 Great Beginner Company Because I had a 3 year hiatus as a professional driver, CRST had a refresher course which was beneficial to both me and other motorists. The Driving School environment is excellent, and pay isn't horrible, considering you are paying for the schooling. Once schooling and on the job training is complete (1 year over the road). I suggest looking for a better paying employer. They do not expect any more from you, nor will they do anything to retain you. ProsGreat first OTR employer, Conditions you for lifestyle ConsPoor pay, poor benefits, poor hometime 2.0 Over the Road Truck Driver | Cedar Rapids, IA | Jun 8, 2015 constant workflow a great team mate Drop and hook loads OTR over the road trucking CRST was my first trucking company i learned how to use a log book while driving i had a great team mate and co driver the hardest part of the job was being away from my family months at a time. but on the other hand i did enjoy seeing america. Prosexperiencing and learning more about the trucking field hands on ConsNot enough home time. 3.0 Professional Driver | Cedar Rapids, IA | May 14, 2013 Plenty of opportunity There is a lot of opportunity but sometimes being too good makes you an asset and your dispatcher wont want to let you advance. Each dispatch gets a commision off your loads so if you prove valuable to their weekly bonuses no matter how much you are approved for advancement they will not do it (they have final say). Most enjoyable part was travel and meeting new people. Typical day is east coast this morning west coast tonight. Hardest part is backing the truck and dealing with your codriver's schedule effecting yours. If you dont like to share or are unclean then your codriver and you may not get along to well. I've been lucky enough to have clean and helpful codrivers that were about business but maintaining my level of professionalism set the tone for how my career went. ProsYou can make great money if you wanna sacrifice family time or personal life ConsDispatchers are forceful and have never driven a truck so they are very unempatheic to home time. 3.0 Owner Operator Driver | Cedar Rapids, IA | Jul 12, 2019 Stay away You've been warned. If your seeking out this company because you want to get your CDL I would go to a different company. Go to Knight Transportation after you get your CDL. Also get your CDL on your own. 4.0 Over the Road Truck Driver | Cedar Rapids, IA | Apr 2, 2018 Driving There were too many times I'd wake up and the other driver was not in the truck; if we were in a gambling state, that's where I would find him. He also didn't eat for his diabetes and it would affect his ability to drive. ProsMake as much money as you want by driving. ConsIf you have a partner, your check can be destroyed by that person's actions. Questions And Answers about CRST Expedited Does crst pay for tolls Asked Feb 4, 2017 Dont work for this company.
