Generally, I'll have to watch through several videos and annotate how users respond to the interface when navigating through the assigned tasks in the usability study. My research assistant manager is very helpful and understanding; he'll help me if I have any questions and will respond relatively quickly. Co-workers at UserTesting are very nice and there is generally a relaxed company culture. Sometimes, watching videos over and over again can be a little repetitive. I am well compensated for my time at UserTesting so I can't complain about this aspect. The flexible hours allow me to pickup projects when I am most available, and if I'm not I can decide not to do so. ProsGet compensated well for an RA, and very flexible hours ConsSometimes it is slow so there won't be any projects available to pick up 3.0 Sales Representative | San Francisco, CA | Oct 30, 2015 Sales office was rocky - but overall good company The sales office had a lot of turbulence during a vast growing period, but overall great company to work for. They did have free lunches twice a week! 5.0 Independent Consultant | Remote | Jul 16, 2018 UserTesting is a side gig This is not a stable income. Testers like myself only get paid for the number of tests we take. Moreover, not all tests will be available to all. However, it isn't a scam of any kind. You do get paid the amount indicated within the timeframe given. Overall, you set the atmosphere from wherever you are and you get a chance to learn of new things ahead of time. Prostests can be short as 15 minutes and the pay remains the same Constests are not always available 4.0 Business Development Manager | San Francisco, CA | Jun 8, 2015 fun with ping pong table Great work life balance and the culture is fun. Management kind of all over the place. Really good first job and sales training is good too. 4.0 Tester | United States | Feb 22, 2018 Good for a side gig. It is a great way to make extra income, just not something to rely on to pay all of the bills. There are many tests available to try for, but this does not mean you qualify for all of them. Its a great gig if you're going to be on your computer all day anyway, seeing as you'll hear a 'ding' when a new test is available to try for. I like to use it while searching for other jobs. You are paid fairly, about $10 per twenty minute review, it's just you may only get one an hour or every hour and a half. You can always come back to it if you have been gone from it for awhile, just review the tutorial and you'll be on your way, meaning the job security is spot on, but I don't see how you would advance in the company. Overall a great site to check out if you need to supplement your income or have extra time after work, but not the job you need to support your life (most likely). Also, I find recording the reviews to be a lot of fun and the time goes by very quickly. I'm thankful for UserTesting. ProsMake your own schedule, Fair payment ConsNot reliable, No benefits 5.0 Recruiter | Mountain View, CA | Dec 23, 2016 Awesome culture, great company, and fun people to work with! UserTesting is on track to IPO in 2-3 years, and it feels great to be a part of the growth of the company! Although we're making moves to increase our salaries to industry standards (in the Silicon Valley), you do get stock options, which will be quite valuable in a few years! There's a ping pong table and foozball table, we have offices in Mountain View, San Francisco, and Atlanta, and, if you have the time, you can get a massage every week! It's challenging work, but it's fun! ProsFree catered lunches on Tues/Thurs, free weekly massages, ping pong table, free weekly happy hours on Fridays, great culture, constant upgrades to facilities, etc. ConsLower salary than industry standard for most positions, but that's offset by the stock options/great benefits you get 4.0 Customer Success Manager | Mountain View, CA | Jun 6, 2016 Great Work Environment Very flexible schedule and great colleagues to work with. Must be able to balance and multitask, as things can get very hectic. 4.0 Social Media Specialist | Fredericksburg, VA | May 20, 2020 Good for a little extra income Enjoy using this site for extra few dollars a week, but not even really as a part time job, the tests you qualify to take are too far between for this to be a reliable part time income. The site is easy to use and seems to be a valuable resource for its clients. 5.0 Independent Contractor | Remote | Jul 21, 2019 Work when you want to Very \u201cgig economy\u201d friendly. Work whenever you decide you have the time to do a good job and need the money. Download a screen/voice recording app and perform specific tasks while you speak out loud about your experience using the site or app. 5.0 Tester | Indianapolis, IN | Apr 17, 2018 Just a side job just reviewed websites and apps. it's a good side job because you can just log on and do it whenever you want, but there is some frustration when you repeatedly don't qualify for tests. Proscan do whenever you want Consdisqualified for many tests Questions And Answers about UserTesting What is the interview process like at UserTesting? Asked Aug 26, 2019 Just an online application process and a sample test to take. Answered May 13, 2020 A sample video must be submitted in order to qualify as a web tester. You are asked to complete a series of tasks while thinking aloud throughout the process. It is then reviewed by their team, who offers great feedback and insight on how to improve your performance. Answered Aug 26, 2019 If you were to leave UserTesting, what would be the reason? Asked Aug 23, 2019 Can't support myself with the little work/pay I'm able to get through this site. They need to drop the demographic screening entirely and convert all their 4-star or higher contract workers to full time salaried and fully benefited employees with flexible schedules. They also need to fix their NDA so that their clients won't have permission to do things that can be used to hurt the reputations of their testers. Answered Jul 10, 2020 Not getting qualified for that many tests. Answered Aug 23, 2019 What advice would you give the CEO of UserTesting about how to improve it? Asked Jan 30, 2019 It can be frustrating when clients cancel live interviews with less than a 24 hr notice. After arranging my schedule to meet with them, it is very disappointing to not be compensated (at least in part) for the inconvenience. It feels unfair that testers are warned very directly warned that they will be penalized for last minute cancellations, but test administrators are not. Answered Aug 26, 2019 Change how screening works. Also For people who are Students AND work it doesn't have a way to indicate both. It is just one way or the other. The screener questions are often structured the same way. Answered Jul 30, 2019 What is the most stressful part about working at UserTesting? Asked Jan 16, 2018 Not having reliable income. Answered Feb 22, 2018 Answering screener questions to not be qualified for a single test. Don't we already give UserTesting our demographics and basic information to help us weed out questions like \"Do you live in France?\" or \"What's your current employment status?\" Answered Jan 16, 2018 How are the working hours at UserTesting? Asked Jul 10, 2020 Excellent! You don't have to keep a schedule. You can come and go as you please, and it's all online, so no commute, no vending machines, no stale coffee, and you get to have your Birthday YOUR WAY! Also, private bathroom and home cooked meals! Can't get better than that! Answered Jul 10, 2020"
