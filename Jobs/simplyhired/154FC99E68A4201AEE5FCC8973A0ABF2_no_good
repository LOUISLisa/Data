The interaction with bankers and other professionals across the region provided an opportunity to enhance my skills overall in training and development of resources in relation to their respective capabilities toward the achievement of overall organizational goals and strategies. A very well developed and globally strong management - For the most recent project undertaken, co-workers included a team of bankers/other professionals from 17 countries within the Caribbean region. These individuals and other staff have all been very supportive of the 'teamwork' concept toward achievement of our goals. I would comment that the most challenging part of the job was to ensure that all participants received and understood the same message toward achievement of the overall goals and the strategy and effort from all concerned to meet the daily output requirements to a high standard of quality. It was also necessary to always have an alternative strategies to mitigate unforeseen/unplanned emergencies. It was most enjoyable to work with individuals from across the Caribbean and Canada and to have been able to complete a very challenging regional task successfully. ProsMeeting and working with individuals from numerous countries ConsMany management/team meetings daily to monitor progess/train of develop plans 5.0 Registered Representative | New York, NY | Feb 25, 2018 Fast paced, commission based salary and compensation, competitive A typical day at CIBC began at 7am each day. I reviewed and reconciled all trade activity from the previous day which included extensive documentation according to the by laws of FINRA. I worked as a 5th Team Member specializing in Options, Munie Bonds, Gov't Bonds, Equities, Margin, LLC's, Research on Investment Strategies for Clients and facilitating Managed Accounts for Qualified investors. After a \"Team Meeting\" each morning, in which we discussed and researched Investment Strategies best suited for our Client base, we began interfacing with Clients and Traders. The job was fast paced and required the ability to assess and re assess Client Investment Strategies according to market fluctuations. A working knowledge of market fluctuations in relation to the Equity Market VS the Bond Market was essential. The challenges of Market Fluctuation was both rewarding and stressful, depending on the day, and brought out the best of each team player and our area of expertise. The most enjoyable part of the day was making money for our Clients, as per our Fiduciary Responsibilities, the guideline of both CIBC and FINRA. The most difficult part of any day, would be large movement in either the Equity Market or the Bond Market and adjusting our trade accordingly, while answering Client concerns. ProsMaking Money for both the Team and Clients ConsLossing Money for both the Team and Clients 2.0 Associate Director | Chicago, IL | Sep 5, 2019 Great benefits -poor finance group dynamics Benefits are great as far as medical, dental, bank holidays and vacation time. No formal employee development, ongoing feedback is absent and team dynamics overall is poor All levels of salaried employees should receive ongoing feedback and have the opportunity to work with managers on his/her own employee development. Being left in the dark until the day of receiving annual merit increases via direct deposit isn\u2019t fair for all parties, starting with senior management on down down. When management decides he/she is leaving after working 8 hours during a paid holiday, then punish their employees for doing the same, this really sets a poor work environment. Employees should feel there\u2019s an open door policy. When errors are discovered and brought to management\u2019s attention, they shouldn\u2019t be told to cover it up. Or to ignore it. Employees should also feel empowered to be able to go to senior management in situations as mentioned here without worry of being fired. Benefits are great, medical phenomenal, 401K standard but the company they use to for their investments is one of the best in the country. Work perks are great, including free onsite gym at both Chicago locations, free coffee/lattes, carbonated drinks, great employee lounge. ConsPoor management, no feedback or development, no guidance or support. Hiding accounting errors. 4.0 Investigator | Nassau, NY | Sep 13, 2017 competitive proof officer , I would get the checks from the previous day, and run them through NCR machine, get the total and then send the total to the supervisor. I would sort the check in numerical order and hand them over to my co-worker for filing. If there is a difference an investigation would have to be done to make sure the customer doesn't loose and money. We usually would get check companies come in so we can review the encoding on the check to make sure the customer checks are protected. Management was hard, but after a few years we had a great working relationship. the hardest part of the job is making sure all of the thousand checks are balanced as well as all of the encoding are correct. The most enjoyable part is the race the staff would have to see if we can beat our time.

The property housed many of the Ambassadors and high Commissioners along with Industry leaders. Being responsible for the Real Estate I learned the art of selling to the very wealthy by creating a really impressive lifestyle environment. I was on my own but reported to the local Director and the banks. There was not much of a culture per se since I was mostly on my own with a small staff. I really enjoyed training the staff, however. The hardest part of the job was the Real Estate sales as there was only the indigenous market which presented a huge challenge. I enjoyed meeting some very interesting people and also selling the apartments.

The experience has taught me alot as you interact with a myriad of personalities. It enables you to be tolerant of different persons who you don't normally see on a daily basis. Over time you learn computer skills, even when you thought you knew it all. Speaking to costumers in person or via telephone and assisting them with their differences was an awesome experience. The bank has taught me to be punctual, efficient and productive. I would recommend persons to get an experience as it enables self-growth.
