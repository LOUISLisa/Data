We make efforts to adapt new technologies and methodologies that can help us optimize our time, and we expect you to collaborate on these efforts if you're an expert on any of those fields.

What's Your Name, Again? Our name is easy. Just say \"A.\" The [A] brackets represent markup, microdata, content intelligence. The letter \"[A]\" represents the start, initiation, beginning of change. We are going to help change the world with intelligent content. Learn more about [A] at simplea.com. If this sounds like you, then write up a cover letter letting [A] know why you want to work at [A], what you do best, and what inspires you.
