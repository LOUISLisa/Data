The Vehicle Test Engineer role is an excellent opportunity for an accomplished automotive test engineer looking for an opportunity to build a deeper understanding of automated driving technology, at a young, rapidly growing company, offering the excitement of a fast-moving start-up, while having the financial backing and trust of one of the largest and most successful automakers in the world. You The Vehicle Test Engineer will have a significant opportunity to influence TRI\u2019s emergent AD testing strategy, development & operation of TRI proving grounds, develop and verify new test methods, equipment, processes, procedures, and policies. We are looking for an experienced test engineer who is passionate about developing and deploying technology that will improve the safety, accessibility, convenience, and efficiency of mobility solutions affecting millions of consumers. The Vehicle Test Engineer will work closely with TRI\u2019s Field Operations personnel who do most of the driving/operation of TRI\u2019s prototype AD vehicles. They will also work with Systems Engineering and Simulation teams on verification strategies. They will also work closely with Program Managers, on getting good test and demonstration plans in place, and helping the team execute them. Test track personnel and test equipment suppliers will be critical supplier partners for the Vehicle Test Engineer. The position will initially report to TRI\u2019s Test Engineering Manager. Some domestic overnight travel required (<25%) with potentially significant local travel to regional test tracks (including Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, Fowlerville, Ottawa Lake). Responsibilities: Build knowledge of TRI\u2019s vehicle testing needs, alternative testing facilities, state-of-the-art AD testing methods, and test equipment. Evaluate, select, install, and become an expert operator and trouble-shooter of test tools and software. This includes a variety of \u201csoft targets\u201d and mobility mechanisms to operate within simulated traffic scenarios. Maintain awareness of the latest test technology in this fast-moving product space, continually growing TRI\u2019s testing proficiency. Assist in the design, development, and operationalization of TRI test tracks. Develop closed-course layouts and specify temporary roadside furniture for simulated urban and highway driving scenarios that exercise as much AD functionality in constrained track spaces. Collaborate with Systems Engineering and Simulation teams in creating structured testing to verify the requirements of the Automated Driving Systems. Develop and execute the full-vehicle proving ground procedures. Ensure test measurement variation (Gauge R&R) is understood and minimized. Participate in industry conferences and committees with other experts in this area to gain expertise and support TRI\u2019s interests. Potentially influence the development of industry standards. Support the AD Team in articulating testing objectives and developing realistic work plans that complete needed testing as timely and efficiently as possible. Serve as technical liaison with any outside testing services needed by the AD Team. Ensure proper vehicle systems obtained for testing, along with proper test equipment configured for needed testing. Attention to detail is critical to ensure valid test conditions and vehicle configuration prior to test initiation. Support algorithm development personnel in completing Scrum-based sprints.
