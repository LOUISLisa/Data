Your first day will consist of the night manager giving you a 10 minute orientation and from there, will drive you in a cart to place you with all the other temps. There are probably only about 7 temps at that work the night shift. Temps and permanents do not work together. Temps will work with temps, and permanents, will work with permanents. However if temps are behind on work, they will bring a few permanents to help out. Temps will always be behind from time to time due to the high turn over rate so help will always be needed. The job task at the beginning of the work shift for temps will consists of unloading bubble wraps from a trailer. These bubble wraps are not heavy, but theyre wide, and you can still injure yourself if you don\u2019t use the proper lifting technique. Unloading bubble wraps on the night shift is usually a job task that takes about 30-45 minutes. The thing is, unloading bubble wraps is not your primary job and it was never your job task, they only give it to the temps because its something for you to do until what you signed up for is available at 9pm. Your main job task as a temp is to cut pallets of boxes. The fork lift drivers will line up pallets, and pallets upon pallets of boxes and your job task, depending on how the other temps have the system set up, is to remove paper work from the pallet, cut the card...more ProsThe Supervisor who overlooked the temps was a great guy Consnot given the proper tools 1.0 Warehouse Worker | Coppell, TX | Mar 27, 2015 Worst Managed Company Award In all my years of working this is by far the worst managed company ever. Sure they're a million dollar business., the pay and benefits are good but at what cost? If you ever have to wake up in the morning and think what's the worst that can happen, then my friend you have thought of Uline. Management is poor, they talk to you like they are just way better than you, nobody has a back bone in that company cause every answer you get is, \"that's what corporate said\". If you have a good idea you can forget it. They don't care what you have to say, think, do, or feel unless it's the Uline way. Management told me Work was more important than family and it took me everything in my will to keep from cursing or punching him in the face. You aren't allowed to be sick cause if if you are it counts against your attendance, who cares that your lying in the hospital, you better well hit your production numbers no if's, and's or but's. God forbid if it snows and you can't leave your house due to ice, even though the schools in the area are shut down too, confirming its unsafe for kids to go to school, you better make sure u rent a snow sled and somehow make it to work.

I'm coming up on my 1 year anniversary as a Customer Service Representative at Uline. I'm in my late 20's and this is my 3rd \"Adult\" job. HANDS DOWN, this is the best place I've been a part of and the place I can confidently call my career. The culture is unlike any I've ever seen in a work place. The positivity flows from the management all the way down to the newest employee. Speaking of being a new employee, the training program works wonders! You spend just about 4 weeks in a classroom setting learning products and procedures from the most knowledgeable trainers you could ask for. Mix in a little side by side coaching where you get to sit and watch more tenured reps take live calls and you're ready by the time it's your turn to provide the best Customer Service in the industry. The resources don't stop there. Once you're on your own taking live calls, you have a safety blanket of a team of more tenured reps available to help you in seconds. The only way to fail here is if you WANT to fail. Managers and supervisors are all available and very much approachable. Everyone is willing to help and teach along the way. It's been less than a year and I've already earned some more responsibilities and new job functions. You don't have to get \"stuck\" here. Endless resources have set me up for success here and I couldn't be happier. Well I guess if I was CEO I probably would be a little bit happier....

Uline is a fast paced and rapidly growing organization. Being part of this success is an honor. The environment is intense, and staff are held to the highest level of professionalism and quality. I like that! The Customer Service team in the Hudson branch are some of the nicest and hardest working people I have ever met! Everyone arrives to work ready for their day. There is no drama, and there are no \"back room antics\". Employee expectations are clearly defined during the interview process, and the onboarding process. After initial training, all staff understand their role and expectations. There are no hidden agendas! It is simple: come to work, do your job and go home to family & friends. OT is available, but NEVER mandatory. Holiday staffing is shared by all - including upper Management, and rotates from year to year. It is very fair! Uline's Customer Service system technology is state of the art. We use dual screens, and our phone system is tied into our computer system. Calls / emails come in, and accounts automatically pop onto our screens. We are constantly offered product and procedure training, and Management wants to hear our ideas! I have worked for a handful of Customer Service organizations, and this is, by far, the most organized and supportive group! For a mature and hard working employee, this environment refreshing!!

I don't know, don't understand cause they never tell me nothing about it, I am a bilingual in Spanish business developer with 4 years of college in my country ( colombia ) not related to the jobs I have applied for, but I need to work, I need to pay my bills, with a very clean background and driving record, with more than 10 years of experience in the field of sales, however these guys at ULINE are very unprofessional , they don't care about you, about your applications, about the importance of giving a short and courteous response to all the applicants and maybe a brief explanation about the reason they found for disqualifying you from any type of job at that company. If they are not hiring, that is understandable, but why they keep on running those jib ads all year around on all the major internet sites like career builder, indeed, monster, etc...why? Some companies like this one are taking advantage of the actual crisis in usa to play their own games very dirty with no scrupulous at all, they are mean people, please avoid them, don't apply there, it tells a lot about the lack of people skills from those peers working there in the recruiting department... That sucks....they should treat all the applicants with respect and professionalism... ProsNothing. ConsEverything. 2.0 Warehouse Worker | Ontario, CA | Aug 8, 2018 It's a job not a career I am currently a freight stock picker. The job is great if you are able to keep to yourself and keep and smile on in front of management. The pay, for what the job entails, is very good. If you enjoy being able to keep interactions to a minimum and focus on your work, then it is a great job. You are merely. Not your employee number, but your productivity and accuracy for that day. It does not matter if you are able to exceed numbers on a daily basis. If you have one bad day, or one error outside of your control, then that is all you become to your management. The old adage of \"what have you done for me lately,\" is very apt here. Any sense of identity and individuality is thrown out of the window here. You must conform to their set of standards otherwise you are seen as a problem. Lack of career advancement is non-existent, unless you assimilate. From my experience, you have to excel above and beyond all goals in place to be even considered. Only then THEY will place you where they like. If you request to learn other responsibilities, then it becomes a constant barrage of misleading or leading on. There were many empty promises made that lead to nowhere. It is a good job if you are able to fit their mold, but disagree or speak your voice on any issue, you become a nuisance. All that is required of you is to keep your head down and focus on the task at hand and you can excel here. It could be an excellent career if not for the management. Otherwise,...more ProsPay and Benefits ConsManagement 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Kenosha, WI | Jun 14, 2019 The \"Great Company\" vibe wears off I started my job search here, just like you are right now. I read the bad reviews. I ignored them. I thought they were disgruntled employees who were not good workers. I was wrong. I ignored the reviews and I found myself in a very miserable state every day. I worked at Uline for over two years and at the beginning thought it was great. They pay, benefits, bonuses and free food often were all nice perks. It was what was hiding behind these perks that ruined everything. Inside these four walls, you will witness hardworking people losing their souls. Management will pick their favorites and not care about any one else. You are replaceable. I would walk into work every day wondering if I was going to get fired, even though I was one of the hardest working members on my team. Everyone pretends to like the company, but everyone is afraid to speak up because they know if they do, they will be fired. Everything at Uline is on a report. Right down to how many times you go to the bathroom a day, if you are in CS. I escaped CS about a year into working here and I thought I was going to be fine. Nope. I was wrong. Even outside of CS, it is still miserable. Managers encourage you to talk to them and express any concerns, but once you do, they ignore you and treat you as if you are the problem. Leaving this company was the best thing I have ever done. I did not realize how depressing this place was until I got out. ProsFree food, good pay, benefits, bonuses Consstrict dress code, management, customers, coworkers 1.0 Packer | Pleasant Prairie, WI | May 21, 2019 Horrible place to work. Management is horrible. Team leads and managers favor favoritism and really have no idea how to manage a warehouse. Most act like big shots when they are alone but as soon as their boss is around they act like personal assistants saying yes sir. It's like they get people from the homeless shelters as team leads and managers. Work was easy but physical. Just pack boxes all day. No room for advancement. 3 warehouse departments. No pay raises for advancing in departments. Just more work for same pay. Some overtime which is pretty good. Owners are good people. But they should really change their whole management. The only reason why the company keeps growing is because of more locations being opened and they are able to sell and deliver to more customers in farther areas. It has nothing to do with their management. Management is WAY stronger in other companies. HIGH employee turnover rates. Worked there almost a year and seen about 16 people quit and 8 new people get hired. Seen about 3 people get fired. Only a few employees have been there years and that's because management loves to use them as examples to people that come see how the warehouse works. Overall waste of time to work here. Only reason why people work here is because the pay is decent. Notice how I said decent. It's not worth it though. You can literally make the same or more at other warehouses if you really try. ProsGood insurance. Pay is alright. Free water. lol ConsManagement sucks. 5.0 Customer Service Representative | Allentown, PA | Aug 15, 2017 I love working at Uline I have been working here for a little over a year. I was very nervous starting here because I had made a career change, and I'm in my late 30s. The only regret I have is that I didn't do this sooner. This is a great place to work. My coworkers are amazing and management is approachable and always willing to help. I ran a very busy office in my previous job, so it was hard for me to \"start over\" somewhere else. The training here is top notch. They give all new reps the tools they need to succeed and are with you every step of the way. My team lead is amazing and continued where the trainers left off. In the little time that I have been here, I have been moving up and learning new functions. So there is opportunity to move and learn and grow. I have had bad jobs in my life, and this is definitely not one of them. They have family activities for our families and really make me feel like I'm not just a number and that all us \"little people\" really matter. They go out of their way to make sure we feel appreciated. I actually don't mind getting up and coming into work every day and I don't mind working over time. How many people can say that???? Hands down, this is the best employer I have ever had, and unless they make me leave, I'm not going anywhere! Prosgreat work environment, amazing coworkers and management, opportunity to move up, bonuses, employees are appreciated ConsThere are no cons to working here, and that's the honest truth. Questions And Answers about Uline What is the interview process like at Uline? Asked Jul 20, 2016 The interview process begins with 4 assessment tests taken at home: 1st one is a word association. You are given a list of 30 - 40 groups of 4 words, you choose which most and which least describes your work style. Examples are: respectful, pioneering, optimist, helpful; and expressive, conscientious, dominant, responsive. Assessment 2 consists of 70 questions about yourself, i.e. \"you enjoy having a wide range of acquaintances,\" and \"you are almost never late for appointments, and \"you remain unbiased even if it means damaging good relations with people.\" Assessment 3 is 50 questions on salesmanship i.e. \"after giving a demonstration, the customer inquires, \"do you have a box?' You know you have several. You should reply...\" You choose the best out of four possible answers. The fourth home assessment is a writing exercise. You are given a sample text and you must condense and rewrite it into the Uline writing style for email. You are given an example to help you along. At the interview, you receive two more assessments, each timed 4 minutes. One tests your ability to identify number patterns, i.e. 2, 8, 3, 8, 4, 8, __, __ (answer should be 5, 8). The second you are given 2 sets of numbers, and you check each pair that is identical as quickly as you can. For example: 90210, 90210 â 10034, 10043 â. The interviewer asked pretty basic questions, 'where do you see yourself in 5 years?\" What are your strengths? What do you need help with? How would your former boss describe you?\" The question also came up about the company's dress code, if I'd have any problem with it. I answered, \"I am resilient and adaptable. I wouldn't let a dress code impede me from moving forward.\" They also ask for a salary range which I researched the night before and answered a cool 80 - 85K. Second interviews are with the team to get the 'day in the life at Uline,\" but I didn't make it that far. I was notified one week after interview #1.
