My career as a Diesel Motor Mechanic began on the 23rd Dec 2004 when I attained my Engineering apprenticeship. The qualifications I attained Included: Fully UK Driving licence (Heavy goods Vehicles / crane licence / Engineering Mechanical NVQ 3 / Installation, commissioning and maintenance (City and Guilds) LVL 3, Engineering Environment Awareness / Engineering Techniques / Maintenance Safety Practices / Fitting and Assembling Techniques and Technology. A typical day would involve repairing, replacement, adjustment of worn defective assemblies. Realignment / adjustment of steering, tracking , wheel bearing adjustment. Replacement of power steering pumps. Testing heating, water systems and replacing defective coolant assemblies(replacement of Radiators, water pumps). Fuel fault finding, fuel pump injector timing and replacement. Removal of Engines, gearboxes, Drive trains. I had a close relationship with the management. Ensuring urgently required spares and repair decisions where made efficiently for the best repair technique. One of the most challenging, but enjoyable parts of the job is working in sometimes isolated locations. Having to improvise and think on my feet to get the repair done and the vehicle fixed, fit for task. I enjoyed working with a close knit team. Having a support network behind me and also be part of that network. Supporting other Mechanics and trades and offering them mechanical support / help when required. Prosworking worldwide. Conshaving to adapt repair techniques depending on location in the world, but adapting was part of the learning / experience. 4.0 Transport Manager | Remote | Mar 31, 2015 Diverse Career A typical day at work would perhaps include a Squadron/Company muster parade, Physical training, Trade work dependant on your role and dependant on the unit role further training may take place for operational roles. Training and working within in the British Army makes you a self motivated versatile and very adaptable individual. My career gave me the opportunity to participate in various roles ranging from Transport management, IT subject matter expert, Close protection and also being a member of the boxing team. Management within the British Army is generally good and with your own motivation you can gain management skills and have the ability to rise through the ranks the only limitation would be yourself. Co-workers within the British Army are probably some of the most loyal and reliable people that I have worked with everyone comes from different backgrounds but goes through the same rigorous process to get into the Army so everyone from the lowest to highest rank has experienced the same basic training. You certainly make friends for life. I would say the hardest part of the job would be leaving loved ones when going on operational tours but there is an awful lot of background support for the soldier and families left behind. The most enjoyable part of the job would be for me travel experience of new places and cultures the friends you make sports and adventure training that you can participate in. ProsTravel, diversity, ability to carry out different roles whether trade related or not and sports. Consnone i can think of. 3.0 Soldier | Driver, AR | Aug 21, 2019 Great for young singles and kickstarting your career. I had a excellent time whilst serving. I met new people from all different backgrounds that was a education in its self by understanding all the different cultures. Excellent opportunities to play sports. Not that much going on in the world now tours are far few and in between. Which is where you learn hands on your trade and gain them valuable skills. Once you settle down and start to build your family that's where the army let's you down you may be on a quarter with your family but always away on conyinus training and somehow once you become married and have young children you always seem to be top of the list to deploy on pointless exercises which no one wants to take part in while the single living in bods get the time off with welfare to go home and see there family. But but this is no good for the married accompanied with kids because you gain from seeing your family every day. Further to this the public sector has failed to keep the pay in line with in flation they say the offer a pay rise which is all well and good but then they increase the cost of the poor accommodation depending on the location you are posted to and increase the food in the cook house which I can only describe as microwave un healthy food since they have reduced the Chef trades. Which has led to overweight and healthy soldiers cant be good considering the army marches on their stomach. 5.0 Fabricator/Welder | National, WV | Sep 7, 2012 very productice but a high pressure place to work In my time time in the British Army a typical day at work would consist of at least one session of physical training plus six to eight hours work in my welders bay. if i wasn't at work in the regiment i was away training towards my job as a welder or bomb disposal so i gained my NVQ level 3 as listed in my qualifications on top of these qualifications i gained a lot of in house qualifications pertinent to the Army. Also due to promotion courses i learned how to manage people and i was also responsible for writing reports on people and job requirements. And due to the ever changing nature of the job i learned to be adaptable to not only tasks but environment. During my time time served in the Army i have met and worked with a very diverse bunch of people ranging from the extremely intelligent to the other end of the scale and over time I've learned to communicate with every one from high ranks to low. and due to the ethos of the forces we all shared the work was enjoyable. the hardest part of my job without doubt was loosing friends due to the nature of the job. the most enjoyable part of the job was the team spirit. Prosall your bills are taken care of before you see your wages, plus thirty days leave a year plus bank holidays Conslong hours, long deployments to different places, being on call twenty four seven every day of the year 5.0 i was on an insight course | Folkstone, NC | Dec 14, 2012 very hard but rewardable I only went for a 5 day insight course and was not actually part of the British army but during my time there we had mixed activities both mentally and physically hard as well as enjoyable. i improved my team work skills, leadership skills and came away with better people skills. the whole week there was hard but it was all also enjoyable. this was a course that lasted a week, days and nights. I had to follow orders quickly and precisely. On the first day we had an introduction and fitness assessment (1.5 mile run, sit ups, push ups). The second day we did command tasks which involve leadership and teamwork skills and mountain biking. Day 3 we prepared for and started a 24 hour exercise where we had to carry out a reconnaissance patrol, use our initiative to use our surroundings to accomplish tasks, practice firing under contact and concentrate when we are sleep deprived. Day 4 we got back and packed up after the 24 hour exercise. Day 5 we were debriefed, given certificates for completing the course, I won an award for the best endeavour, then travelled home. Prosfree lunches and very rewardable Conscompletely draining and worked all day and sometimes over night 5.0 Store Manager | Maine | May 1, 2018 Heck of a roller coaster ride Get through your first two years, get promoted. Start learning to be a leader, look towards your next promotion. Learn to be a leader at this level. Continue for the next 24 years. Along the way you'll have quite a bit of time away from home, you'll make some life long friends who will become family. You'll learn skills that will come naturally to you, skills that civilians pay a lot of money to gain but don't come naturally to them. You'll be terrified some of the time, you'll learn to call some pretty horrible places home for a while. You civilian friends will think your strange and you've changed, and they definitely won't get you new sense of humour. You'll get adventure training holidays or expeditions free or heavily subsidised. You'll have the potential to play sports and go on tours to any country. You'll get free medical, dental, physio care as and when and for as long as you require it. You'll have a lot of ups and downs, but when you get to the end you'll look back and wonder what all the fuss was about. ProsFree, medical, subsidised accomodation, free gym menbership, full pay when sick. ConsCan be long hours and short notice moves 4.0 Chef | Remote | Oct 29, 2013 challenging and rewarding daily as a production supervisor it was my responsibility to check the cleanliness of the kitchen prior to the shift starting then i would have to brief the team of the tasks for the day this included normal meals, late meals and early mealsthis the briefing also included the daily routine and any specific tasks for example any traing or extra cleaning tasks within the department i was answerable to ht e senior caterers in the department but at times i was able to advise them on some aspects due to my experiance in certain areas for example in the use of the field catering equipment the hardest part of the job was training the junior chefs for deployment but not being able to make them fully comprehend the rigours of what was required during these peiods away the most enjoyable was seeing the soldiers happy after being out on patrol coming back in and getting a freshly cooked hot meal Prosjob security and advancement Conslong periods away from home 5.0 Communication Specialist | Remote | Jul 26, 2015 Amazing and Challenging \" Established the communication system of a training exercise using the radio spectrum and various antenna systems. \" Delivered lessons of the classified BOWMAN system to new recruits and graduated Officers. \" Maintained safety checks and audit the equipment for the organisations fleet of BOWMAN Landrovers ready for deployment worldwide. \" Responsible for distribution and shipping of BOWMAN stores and equipment ensuring goods are delivered within agreed time lines and in a serviceable condition. \" Responsible for prioritising of delivery schedule on a daily bases to insure goods and equipment are dispatched in a timely manner. \" Identified and methodically rectified failures in equipment. \" Completed general administrative duties. \" Represented the British Army and upheld a high level of pride in appearance and manner. 5.0 Electronics Technician | Remote | Mar 3, 2014 Challenging and exciting I have had a great 5 years within the British army, the people I have met within the forces will always be a large part of my life and made uncomfortable working conditions bearable. within the army i was employed as an electronics technician and was responsible for the first line repair for a wide variety of military equipment. when not on exercises or working there is always the oppertunity to play sports or go on adventure training which can vary from rock climbing in Wales to Skiing in canada. the hardest part of working within the army was the fact that you were never off the clock which made it very difficult to plan ahead things such as holidays. the best part of the job was the chance to travel to various parts of the world with some amazing people.
