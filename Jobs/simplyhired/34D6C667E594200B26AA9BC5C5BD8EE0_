The Protein Research team evaluates, purifies, and characterizes novel plant proteins along with investigating ways to enhance their functionality within food systems. Additionally, we are working on developing methods to characterize and prototype unique plant-based products. This role will be responsible for advancing our in-house expertise in plant protein gelling and thermoreversible gels for new product research and prototyping around plant-based cheese. We are looking for someone who can generate ideas and convert them into successful experiments; someone who can master existing technologies and build on it using a variety of food science, biophysics, chemistry, biochemistry, and engineering approaches. A candidate should be knowledgeable in understanding physical and chemical properties of proteins within food systems. Some topics of demonstrated research from this candidate should include characterizing and understanding structure/function properties of plant proteins, biopolymers, and other ingredients within complex food systems at the molecular, microscopic, and mesoscopic scale. Additionally, the candidate should have understanding of thermal and rheological properties of plant proteins, fatty acids for the development of thermoreversible gels for use in analog cheese systems. Finally, to be successful this candidate will need to actively collaborate with product development, process engineering, and analytics. Responsibilities The Scientist will be an integral member of the R&D team. They will work with researchers to answer scientific questions and will be responsible for a broad range of tasks, including: Planning, managing, and executing protein research from bench to pilot scale with the goal of improving plant protein functionality within model food systems Bottom up design of thermoreversible plant protein gels and subsequent development of food model systems for non-dairy applications (e.g. cheese, yogurt) Developing methods to characterize protein functionality within model food systems for a variety of plant protein sources Data visualization and statistical analysis of experimental results as well as interpreting and communicating the findings to R&D teams Review and apply learnings from academic literature, patent filings and public domain information, to long and short-term in-house research, on an ongoing basis Proactively apply learnings towards advancing Ripples IP portfolio Collaborate with cross-functional teams (Pilot Plant, Analytical, Manufacturing, Product Development) to execute and manage timely completion of projects Serve as a subject matter expert in protein research that can mentor and help develop internal talent Requirements This position requires a candidate with the following experience: PhD in food science, biochemistry, chemistry, biology or a related field. Alternatively, a Master\u2019s degree in the above fields, with 5+ years of relevant food industry experience Deep understanding of the structure-function properties for proteins, polysaccharides, and fats within complex food systems such as hydrocolloids, emulsions, foams, gels, etc. Experience formulating plant protein gels and subsequent understanding of their structure-function properties Knowledgeable in methods to characterize plant protein gels and food systems using instrumentation such as rheometer, texture analyzer, particle size analyzer, etc. Ability to interpret protein characterization data from techniques such as proteomics, SDS-PAGE, CD, and/or DSC Understanding of non-dairy & dairy food systems (e.g. milk, cheese, yogurt), along with subsequent processing equipment (separators, driers, homogenizers, cookers, extruders, etc.) Ability to manage and organize multi-disciplinary projects and see them through from initial planning to execution and reporting Experience working with data visualization software (Excel, JMP, Spotfire) Effective and direct communication skills; ability to present research findings to scientists and non-technical audiences ** Bonus Points** Experience with dairy or non-dairy cheese systems, processing & manufacturing Ability to execute statistical design of experiments, including selection and analysis Knowledge of plant-based food systems and the industry Utilizing enzymes or chemicals to manipulate protein, oil, and polysaccharide systems Understanding of microbial growth within protein and food materials Familiarity with sensory properties and molecular mechanisms of taste and smell "
