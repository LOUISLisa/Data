Was apart of the US expansion team where we took NYC for the summer, literally going from restaurant to restaurant connecting with business owners. 1.0 Associate | Dallas, TX | Jan 8, 2020 yep is sucks I would not work here. The company lacks organization, and management has no idea what they're doing. The company overpaid temps and over-hired, before they even had a product to sell. They had to lay off their entire U.S. office due to poor planning and fiscal projection. 5.0 Regional Sales Manager | Delhi, CA | Nov 28, 2017 A brilliantly motivated and passionate company to work for Starting from the founder and all the way to an intern - everyone was very passionate to get Zomato where it is today. The mantra of \"1% done\" made us all work towards the long term goal everyday. I looked forward to go to work in the morning and enjoyed my day since no one reminded you of what work needed to be done that day. The sense of ownership each of us had made us balance our work day. ProsFriendly environment, free lunches Consmedical benefits 3.0 Associate | San Francisco, CA | Jun 8, 2017 productive and fun workplace I started my professional career with this company. There was some issue with the management team, but overall I learned a lot and I was able to build my resume. 2.0 Associate | New York, NY | Oct 26, 2015 Decent Culture, Terrible Leadership I was a part of the mass layoff in the US, so clearly I'm appalled at the massive screw up from the leadership. That being said, the best thing about that job were the people on my local team. Friendly, effective, and passionate people were drawn to the team and I enjoyed being there greatly. ProsGreat people, free beer, the sense of progress ConsThey laid off 300 people because the company spent too much money without a plan, Really messed up people's lives because of irresponsibility. 1.0 Associate | Austin, TX | Oct 23, 2015 Fun company but terrible planning They had no fore-sight with their decision to move into the US market. No communication between higher ups. Eventually fired everyone in the US at the same time very unexpectedly due to poor planning. 5.0 Associate | Dallas, TX | Jun 17, 2015 Zomato Amazing company. the people there are awesome and very nice and helpful. Zomato just acquired urban spoon and took the app to a whole new level. 5.0 Warehouse Lead | San Francisco, CA | Mar 22, 2016 Productive and fun workplace with a great startup culture and some brilliant minds to work with. A typical day at work consisted of planning out tasks for my teams. Following up on their previous tasks and checking for mistakes or errors. Reading their daily reports and asking relevant questions. Also, providing them training to improve certain skills. It also consisted of holding meetings and trying to solve issues which were holding us back to perform certain tasks. I learned a great deal about data analysis, people management, content strategy, data planning, task planning, time management, custom content creation etc. I would say that the hardest part of the job was the commute to and from office. The most enjoyable part of the was the culture and the people that made up that culture. We had some brilliant minds to work with and experience in general was amazing. ProsGrowth Opportunities 4.0 Research Intern | New York, NY | Jan 8, 2019 Interesting and Fun The job required getting information on food establishments for public domain use, while also encorporating a social media format. The staff were extremely friendly and very diverse. 2.0 Operations Associate | Dallas, TX | Feb 8, 2017 Lazy management No vision, inability to execute, lazy upper management with a heavy clique culture at the E-team level. There could be much more done to identify team's capabilities and leverage those. Managers are often incompetent and unable to manage maturely.
