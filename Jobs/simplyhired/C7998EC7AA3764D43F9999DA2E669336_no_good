Reviews at Rover.com 4.0 Operations Associate | Seattle, WA | May 25, 2020 Great place to work, but expect a lot of organization changes. I spent nearly 4 years at Rover on various teams on the operations side of the business. Here's a few things to note before applying to a position at Rover: You will be in a VERY distracting work environment. There are a lot of dogs in the office. While the dogs are generally well behaved, dogs will be dogs. They'll play around constantly, steal your chairs (lol), and have accidents in your area. It takes a lot effort to stay focused with so many distractions in your immediate area. Rover changes A LOT. It is essential that you can work independently and provide your own autonomously. You may not be able to rely on support of your manager, as you could be reporting to a new person before your project needs to be delivered. The pay structure is not as rewarding as it should be. However, they have a good benefits package to supplement. ------- If you are interviewing for a position at Rover, please expect for a longer interview process that still manages to move quickly. When initially contacted back by Rover, I was proved a written exam to test your customer focus and your ability to research solutions for customer problems (bonus points from my experience if you are able to look at their current process/policies and provide constructive feedback). After my exam was submitted, I heard back from someone within 24 hours to schedule my first phone screen with the hiring manager. This phone screen wasn't a formal interview, rather, they were getting to know me as ...more 2.0 Pet Sitter | Dayton, OH | May 8, 2019 Great concept, awful execution Getting paid to hang out with dogs sounds like a total dream come true. It's as simple as downloading an app, right? Ehhh not exactly. Upon signing up, you are forced to pay $25 for a \"background check\", which is never mentioned up until its time to pay. Never in any of my other work experiences have I needed to pay for a background check, but who knows, maybe it's just so the app can make a little bit of extra profit. So once you cough up $25 and make your account, it should be as easy as setting up your schedule, pay rates, and profile description. My favorite thing about the app by far is how customizable everything is. When you're available, how much you get paid, how many walks a day you can do, what kind of dogs you prefer, is all completely up to you. You can tailor your schedule around any other existing engagements you may have, and you can set your prices as low or as high as you wish, which is a total luxury compared to most other jobs. However, I have yet to receive a single appointment from a dog owner. And this is because of how the app is set up. I've got my entire profile filled out with my experience and preferences, mentioning my volunteering for rescues and 10+ years living with dogs. The radius I was willing to drive was about 12 miles out, and my availability was wide open every day of the week. My pay rates were lower than any of the top results for my area, and yet, I've had the app since January and haven't been contacted once. I realize this ma...more ProsFull control over schedule and pay rates, convenient app, easy work for dog lovers Cons$25 fee just to sign up, impossible to get customers as a newcomer 1.0 Independent Contractor | Seattle, WA | Dec 13, 2017 Terrible Experience! I was a long-time Rover walker who had built up a large client base over a long period of time. I was highly-rated (40+ 5-star reviews), reliable, hard-working, and successful, and - as long as they skimmed 20% of my income each week - the company was very happy with me. However, lately, because of the continued loss of income due to Rover's cuts, I decided to try working independently as a walker while keeping my Rover profile active for pet sitting only. My clients offered to stay with me when I told them I was no longer doing walks (only sits) through Rover. When Rover saw that a few of my clients were not booking through them any longer (they are like Big Brother, monitoring all of your messages with clients), they immediately terminated my account without any advance notice, stating I would never be allowed to work for them ever again... Their email was startling in its threatening, retaliatory tone - quite a transformation from their friendly, supportive, bubbly facade while you're working/making money for them. Extremely cold and unfeeling. I was speechless, just shocked. In addition, they refused to allow me access to a substantial library of photos I'd taken of my clients' dogs ( which I really wanted to keep) which I'd uploaded onto my profile. I begged them to at least give me my photos (as I had no backups of them) and they flatly refused, saying they were not my property and I had no rights to them. My profile that I worked so hard to build up suddenly, wit...more ProsIndependence ( somewhat) - can make one's own hours. Work outdoors. ConsRover doesn't care about you. 1.0 Dog Walker | Los Angeles, CA | May 14, 2016 A waste of time, energy, resources and not worth the hassle. There was little to gain working for Rover, customer service does not care about you and will be condescending in their correspondence. Despite, following their protocols my fees were deducted a substantial 80% from my earnings, leaving me with $10 for a week of dog sitting two stubborn Pomeranian dogs with limited manners and discipline. Not only that, you may have to deal with unreasonable, demanding pet parents with no manners, compassion or respect for your time, property or well-being. You as a sitter have to compete in a over-saturated market and have to set your rates low because everyone does it too. Despite, being told you have the opportunity and right to set your own rates, the free market dictates your fees, it's about supply and demand. In addition, as a sitter you are not expected to buy insurance, but have to anyway if you want to attract clients. Rover is a bait and switch game, one not worth playing. I had the displeasure of having my legs scratch up, my floors being defecated on twice by a stubborn dog that refuses to relieve itself on walks and bathroom breaks. You will lose sleep, you will slave away and receive no compassion from Rover or the dog owners. I never received my payment in full for the work I did in good faith and Rover.com does not care. The insurance plan does not cover anything and you will not be reimburse for any damages done to property, or any bodily damages a dog inflicts on you, it comes out of your paycheck. You can be compas...more Prosnone ConsRude management, property damage, no system to rate clients, dogs urinating and defecating on your floors, dogs causing bodily harm, low wages, high fees cut from your pay, no support for sitter, dishonest clients 1.0 Dog Walker | Stamford, CT | Mar 13, 2019 Rover closed my account with over 90, 5 star reviews. I was the top sitter in my area and worked for Rover around 3 years. Everything went well during all that time. Then one day someone booked an overnight stay for 4 nights. The guy came to my house to meet and greet and brought his dog, the owner was pleased and I met the dog, she was a rescued pitbull who at that moment seemed to be okay, just like a normal dog. Then the day of the stay came and I was watching the dog, and I realised that she was very, very nervous and anxious, she was shaking and I tried to calm her talking and hugging her, after like 10 minutes she was a little better. . I was watching other dogs at my home and she looked to be more comfortable around the dogs than around people so I decided to take her to a friend's home, to play with other dogs because my friend has a huge fenced backyard, that was bigger than the local dog's park. I had the authorization of the owner to take her dog to dogs parks and runs. At the moment I arrived and I opened the car's door, the dog jumped and ran away so scared. The owner never told me that his dog was so extremely anxious and scared of people. Sadly the dog got lost and I looked for her over 14 hours straight, I didn't even went home to eat or anything, I was so worried about the dog, but I couldn't find her. The owner told me after that , that his dog was very shy and anxious, that he knew it was not my fault that it happened because he knew his dog, he even contacted Rover and explained to them that it was not my f...more Prosflexible hours and availability ConsRover can shut down your account 3.0 Dog Walker | New York, NY | Mar 27, 2018 Working as a dog sitter I have been a sitter on Rover for a while now and I have to say, the company really doesn\u2019t care about their sitters. I have had multiple instances where they blame me for basically \u201cnot knowing\u201d something instead of offering to help. One of my instances with Rover was when a couple I was sitting for had a cancelled flight so they asked me to stay an extra night at their place. I agreed and assumed that they would take care of the extra night of payment through Rover but when I didn\u2019t get compensated, I reached out to Rover. They told me that since I didn\u2019t contact them before agreeing to stay an extra night, I am at a loss and basically have to look at this as a learning mistake. They also sent me this long \u201cNot to do\u201d list and I felt like a child being scolded. I get that I should have contacted Rover to ensure payment but the fault shouldn\u2019t just be on me. The fault should be on the dog parents for not following the rules as well. A company that cares about both parties would reach out to the owners and ask them to pay for the extra night. If they didn\u2019t respond or said no, then at least they tried on my behalf. I recommend that if you start using them to be a dog sitter, you read every single last thing on their website and FAQs or else they will blame you for \u201cnot knowing\u201d. I also think the fees are a bit high. For a company that is just a middle person, they take a lot out of the pay of the sitter. Sometimes I decline jobs because I think it\u2019s just not worth the ...more ProsFlexbile hours ConsThey don't care about sitters 5.0 Pet Sitter | Lexington, KY | Jan 25, 2019 Great For Those Home Full Time Rover was wonderful for me because my other job allows me to work from home so I was able to provide full time care to pets left with me. Because you work as an independent contractor you are able to easily set your own prices, schedule and specifications of what kind of services you want to provide. You have the opportunity to meet lots of amazing people and adorable animals and create wonderful lasting friendships. The only thing really negative I can say is that they have a much higher concern for the clients than they do for their pet care providers. They encourage customers to contact multiple sitters at a time to gauge which one they would like to go with but then dock the performance scores for everyone who did not get the job which lowers your standing in the search rankings. They also dock scores any time you turn down any booking requests no matter if it was due to an unsafe or threatening person or animal which could very well be a safety hazard because it pressures sitters into accepting jobs they are uncomfortable with to avoid having their profile lowered in the results. Rover also takes 20% of all earnings for advertising and \"insurance\" which I would normally be completely fine with but do be warned that their insurance covers little to nothing for the sitter or the sitters property, only for the dog and owners home. For example if you are walking a dog and both of you get hit by a car, the dog would be covered but you would not and thet would most likely dock...more ProsFlexible Schedule ConsUnreasonable Scoring & No Insurance Or Benefits 5.0 Pet Sitter | Charlotte, NC | Apr 3, 2017 Best of both worlds Working with Rover has been an actual dream come true for me. I've always cared for Pets professionally but I was nervous about the liability of being responsible for such precious parts of a strangers life. I have cared for my friends and neighbors pets very regularly, but I never knew what to charge them and I hated discussing the money and the awkward exchange involved. I also was not capable of making an investment in self promotion and marketing to find these potential clients. The other option was to work FOR a dog sitting company that only gave me a small portion of each dog walk or drop in visit. That didn't seem to be quite worth the effort. Rover has given me the platform to be my own boss, set my own schedule and prices but promoted me and my skill set, verified my trustworthiness and offered me the free marketing tools I needed to promote myself! The insurance coverage for each stay gives me and my clients piece of mind and the fact that I so rarely have to discuss my prices and never exchange cash is such a relief because Rover makes that process seamless with my prices automatically calculated and deposited from their bank accounts into mine once the pet sitting service is completed! I just wish there was less competition on the website. Lots of less qualified pet sitters have sprung up on the site in the 4 years I've been working with Rover and they are given priority promotion in the search list for Dog owners to find potential sitters. This leaves me a lot lo...more Prosgreat support from corporate Consunpredictable income, inability to advance 4.0 Pet Sitter | Gainesville, FL | Jun 19, 2019 Low-stress side job, but I wishing for more protection for sitters My overall experience with Rover has been great and customer service is quick to respond to and resolve any questions or problems. Although it requires attention to detail and a strong sense of responsibility, it's a very laid back part-time job and I've met some truly wonderful clients who value me and respect my time. However, it feels like pet owners have many more tools available to them than sitters do (ex: they can request not to be sent a specific dog walker again, they can leave reviews for sitters) which leaves sitters more open to be taken advantage of. We cannot block problematic clients from contacting us, and we can't write reviews that may be helpful to other sitters. I've had clients with severe aggression that was never shared with me by the owner and which will probably not be disclosed to future sitters. One dog had such severe cage aggression that I couldn't let him in or out of his crate without him snarling violently and snapping at my fingers. It's the only time I've been worried about an animal fatally injuring me. Another pet owner is someone I did not meet through Rover, but who has a profile through the site and has harassed 3 sitters (myself included) out of some or all of their earnings. I don't have tools at my disposal to protect another sitter from potential injury from a dangerous dog or from being preyed upon by owners who will try anything to get free pet care. There are clients who don't leave enough pet food and I end up payin...more 4.0 Pet Sitter | Encinitas, CA | Apr 7, 2019 Best job if you love caring for pets! Flexible Schedule! I have been a dog boarder, house sitter, dog walker for Rover since Sept 2018. I live in an area where the demand is high for boarding and house sitting. I also provide 24/7 care at clients homes, in advance. Thus far, I make about 1000-1200 per month. I only board 3 dogs now, so I could increase my income if I board more dogs. I may increase the amount of dogs I accept in the future. I can accept requests or decline them. You show up higher in search results the more you accept requests. You also show up higher in search results if you are available on holidays and you update your availability every day. You can set your rates yourself.

I have enjoyed working with Rover and plan on continuing with them. A good bio on your account is what makes all the difference in securing clients. It is competitive, you have to answer your requests asap so that you can be chosen if a client has sent more than one request.

Why yes, you do! you can be fined or charged with a crime without one in Wake County. Answered Nov 12, 2018 Do you get paid alot if so how much? Asked Oct 14, 2016 You set your own rate. However..... the BIG caveat is that rover takes 20% and then you can\u2019t forget that you have to pay income tax on this money too. So a \u2018competitive\u2019 rate means you could end up barely making minimum wage in some states! This is especially the case for overnight stays where it\u2019s a flat rate covers all of the walks, playtime, and attention the pet needs. Answered Feb 18, 2018 You might get paid substantially if Rover didn't take such a big cut. Out of what it looks like you will get paid, Rocer takes 10% from you and 10% from the dog owner. I get the insurance and their \"service\" with this algorithm that assists you as a contractor but note, it appears to be built to simply make THEM money in the grand scheme. What you end up doing is worth way more than what you get paid for. Hopefully your bookers tip you well and are knowledgeable of these details. Good luck!
