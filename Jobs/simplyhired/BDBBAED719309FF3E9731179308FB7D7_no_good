Technology companies and event organisers. Last year we decided to lean our positioning/brand more towards the event sector (trade show and conference organisers). With the global pandemic, we have seen a drop in business from the event sector (no surprise there) but can happily report we have countered this reduction with an equal increase in business from our B2B Technology existing clients and some new logo. We need to reposition ourselves to lean more towards the B2B Technology market. We think the right person to help us do this will be a combination of creative director (for conceptualisation), positioning legend, and masterful wordsmith. I did say \u201cwe think\u201d. We are looking for someone that can help us find the beautiful interaction between our who, what, how, and why. Then to craft and execute our repositioning (branding, messaging, value propositions, offers, etc.). We are not looking for someone to come in to do tweaks, we are looking for a big, brave and bold creative thinker and writer. A snippet of our positioning move Our what (we do) is Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO) for B2B\u2019s (our WHO). We have a B2B CRO framework (our how ) which guarantees significant improvement in marketing performance. In other words, as the world falls into recession our B2B CRO framework will help B2B\u2019s to get a much better return on their marketing budgets. Who would say no to that? (that\u2019s what we need your help to do). Can you help us turn B2B CRO into the sexiest solution since sliced bread? REQUIREMENTS You have 6+ year experience working for a marketing agency You have deep agency knowledge/experience conceptualising and positioning products/services/companies/brands You have come up the ranks either as a copywriter or a brand/positioning strategist, and now combine these attributes You walk in the shoes of your target persona to get a deep understanding of their key motivators so your can craft amazing value propositions/offers You are a digital native (when we talk CPL, ABM, Intent, CRO, Attribution you get it) Apply Now South Africa United StatesCanada ArgentinaAustraliaBelgiÃ«BrasilDeutschlandEspaÃ±aFranceIndiaIrelandItaliaMÃ©xicoNederlandÃsterreichPortugalSchweizSouth AfricaSverigeUnited KingdomÐ Ð¾ÑÑÐ¸Ñíêµ­ä¸­å½æ¥æ¬ Â© 2020 SH Inc. | Privacy | TermsÂ |Â Privacy Center"
