They have free food in the office (you can pay for any food with your pass) Managers just ask you what you want to do and how many time it will take, nobody hurry up and don't tell you that you should work faster. Everything is really comfortable here except the salary rate.. ProsFree food, good office, cool engineers ConsLow salaries 5.0 Software Engineer | Moscow, ID | Aug 30, 2015 Best place to work in Moscow Fun work, smart engineers, advanced technologies, nice office located in the city center. The company provides a Mac Book pro for every developer. 5.0 Accountant | Moscow, ID | Apr 24, 2020 The company is full of young, smart and enthusiastic people. The corporate culture is really comfortable. The atmosphere is positive. And this encourages to find new solutions to solve problems, be more creative and organized. Pros- strong team - challenging tasks - nice office, good location and facilities - full range of benefits ConsOffice location 5.0 Assessor | Sultan, WA | May 10, 2020 Remote work as an assessor I have worked remotely for Yandex as a search engine assessor. We were paid for the amount of work we have completed. In my opinion, the salary was somewhat low. Especially in the beginning, when you cannot work fast. Quality of your work is strictly controlled. Several mistakes lead to suspension of your account. 4.0 Driver | Russia, OH | Sep 2, 2019 It's normal to work in this company I work in this company since 2015 as an driver, I allmost like this job, because it's wellpayed, and it's not hard. This is my second job and I can combine it with the main work."
