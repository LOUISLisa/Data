Then everything started going downhill. They cut pay from 26 paydays down to 24, paydays are the 7th and 22nd which makes no sense and makes it hard to pay bills. I have never gotten a raise, even after a year and a half, if you make a mistake you're put on a \"final\" and after that they can just fire you. We used to be able to have snacks in the call center, wear jackets when it was cold, etc., but no more. It's long days, low pay, and they are now taking away holiday pay. 1.0 Workforce Manager | Campbellsville, KY | Nov 15, 2019 Terrible place to work Too many young managers that do not know how to be a manager. No respect of managers. Unreasonable goals. Low pay. Health insurance is not affordable. Bathrooms not handicap accessible. Facilities are dirty, and not clean. 5.0 Customer Service/Sales Representative | Kentucky | Sep 13, 2018 Good work enviroment Intelenet is a good company to work for, but the staff is full of drama. Has a high turn over in employment. I loved the job, but some staff liked to cause drama and requesting time off was hard to get approved even after being there for a few years. Prosgood pay, good company, benefits Consdramatic staff, hard to get time off 1.0 Customer Service/Sales Representative | Fort Wayne, IN | Mar 31, 2017 Run away TERRIBLE PAY AND BENEFITS. Unprofessional 100% unorganized the management spent so much time gossiping and telling agents business to everyone! Run far away from this place commission is ABSOLUTE garbage !!! They teach you to be an unethical sales person they tell you to leave out certain things that cost the guest additionally prices never offer discounts don't try to help the customer save money unless they personally ask for it ProsNice team leads, met really good agents ConsPay, management, benefits, ethics 4.0 Interior Designer | West, TX | Nov 29, 2019 Good for Freshers It's related to interior designing but not exactly interior designing work, it is actually most of colour based work likr providing colour scheme to costumers. 4.0 Customer Service Representative | Fargo, ND | Feb 4, 2019 Nice company to work from home You take calls from card members to book or change travel. All your training is done from home on equipment they send you. Class is over phone and web conference. Cons are that if you need to get a hold of HR good luck because you will NEVER get in touch with them. Overall its not a bad company but id say they should have all trainers and supervisors and coaches on the same page. Pay should be higher for the type of stuff agents do. Its a bit confusing with all these codes and what not. Proswork from home ConsEvery trainer is on a different page and AHA have a harder time getting help quick 3.0 Customer Service/Sales Representative | Fort Wayne, IN | Aug 1, 2019 Intelenet When I worked there initially it was cool. Eventually it became overcrowded and ghetto. I\u2019ve heard since then (May 2017) it has calmed down a lot and they seem to screen their candidates it bit better, but you can never be too sure. I worked for Extended Stay America there and it was pretty easy. 2.0 Customer Service Representative | Fort Wayne, IN | Jul 28, 2017 Dont do it Management is terrible, attendance is a joke, they like to play with your money, meaning incentives and when you receive them, they basically lie in interview and training about schedules and compensation for sales, beware working here, and they dont gives raises ProsNone ConsLow pay 9.25, bad management, treat people like garbage 4.0 Customer Service Representative | Campbellsville, KY | Dec 19, 2013 help customers resolve problems with their newspaper On a typical day in between answering calls I enjoyed the chance to read the New York Times online, allowing me to learn a variety of things and expand my vocabulary Prosfrequent employee potlucks, get to read the New York Times on the job for free and work alongside friendly people Consnot much exercise makes employees vulnerable to weightgain 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Fort Wayne, IN | May 6, 2019 stay away lots of people constantly micromanaged endless phone calls and a very VERY noisy environment desk are filthy no one ever cleans the call center at the most the trash gets taking out and that's it. The janitorial person never cleans in the call center. I worked there for almost a year and the toilets and the floors in the mensroom are horrible doesn't look like they ever swept just mopped over the dirt and never wiped down the toilet seats. And the parking is stupid they have this big giant 1/4 mile parking lot and if your disabled good luck finding a parking space that's not a hundred feet to the front entrance.
