Overall Reviews at CSL Plasma 1.0 MSA | Rhode Island | Mar 27, 2020 Shows Their True Nature Corporate doesn't care about you. Ask any employee what it's like to work during this COVID-19 epidemic and they'll tell you. Refuses to give us actual masks, not plastic sheets covering our face. They claim that our donors are always forthcoming with information to determine suitability. They're not. Most people who come through, and make it through, are homeless/drug users/low-lives. They WILL lie if it means they can get $30. For Corporate to say something like that just proves they've NEVER been in any of their centers, or the ones that serves primarily low demographics. Pay is terrible. They'll claim that because you work in an \"area of production,\" that you're not actually healthcare workers. I must say though, that when this was mentioned during this COVID-19 crisis, all of a sudden we're essential and real healthcare workers. My pay hasn't changed to reflect that, nor will I (or anybody else) be receiving hazard pay. They want to cross-train everybody so they can do multiple jobs for the facility. Awesome for if you like to learn new things. What really happens, is that the schedule will be short-staffed, and they'll stick you doing 100 jobs, covering other people's breaks, and doing someone else's job. When people see that you come to floor to help with a long line, they'll just stop working because you're there and will do the work for them. It's asinine. And they get away with it because, everyone who works at CSL gets a million chances. Or if you're somebody's...more Pros1 alcoholic beverage is allowed during your lunch break ConsLow pay, terrible communication/management, CEO literally said they didn't care about employees, refuses to protect its staff with proper PPE 5.0 Center Manager | Durham, NC | Apr 14, 2013 Exciting and Challenging Company with Excellent Opportunities for Professional Growth I have worked with CSL Plasma for just under seven years. My time with the company has been an amazing experience. I have had the opportunity to grow significantly both personally and professionally and it is with a heavy heart that I have made the decision to begin seeking new opportunities outside of CSL. As a Center Manager for CSL Plasma, I have gained extensive experience in many different facets of business management. My responsibilities include hiring, training, and managing employees at the center. I also have responsibility for disciplining and terminating employees when necessary. I manage center finances, ordering supplies, and ensuring the overall quality of the product collected by the center. In all reviews, I have met and exceeded the expectations for my position. I have consistently sought efforts to improve my skills and effectiveness within the company. Most recently, I accepted my current position as the Center Manager for the company\u2019s new facility in Durham, NC. In my role as Center Manager, I was responsible for all decisions surrounding the initial setup of the Durham location. During the center\u2019s first year I have worked to hire all staff members, recruit donors, set up the facility for production, and prepare the business for pre-licensing audits from external agencies such as the FDA and GHA. In the centers first 12 months of operation, I have worked to develop a staff of approximately 50 employees. I have successfully completed all necessary qual...more Prosfast career growth, great support, no day is the same, challenging 2.0 Medical Receptionist | Toledo, OH | Jun 15, 2020 Ok entry-level job in phlebotomy and medical reception, easy part-time retirement job for nurses, but crazy hours I worked for CSL Plasma for a little over a month as a medical receptionist. Then I left because I had a health issue. While I was there, I was welcomed and I was given good training. The main reason why I chose not to go back was the scheduling. It made no sense. We were not scheduled for 1st, 2nd, or 3rd shift for a month or even for a week. Instead, a person\u2019s shift would change from day to day. So, for example, you could be scheduled for midday, opening, closing, opening again, and closing again, in a row, in one week. Or, some variation of that. There was no consistent scheduling of one shift per week. Also, we weren\u2019t given our schedules more than two weeks in advance. All told, the scheduling made it difficult to have a social life outside of work \u2013 which is kind of important if you have family and friends. Another thing to keep in mind: It\u2019s very repetitive work if you are in medical reception or phlebotomy. You follow a protocol, the same protocol, over and over and over again, with little variation, and with minimal interaction with the donors. It is like being a human cog in a machine. If you like variety, and especially if you like patient-focused health care, this is probably *not* the right job for you. Oh, and make sure you have 911 speed-dialed into your phone, in case any of the donors ODs or threatens violence. Most donors are well-behaved: they are simply poor people selling their plasma because they need the extra $30-35. However, there...more Prosentry-level job in phlebotomy or medical reception, easy part-time job for nurses Consrandom scheduling, sometimes sketchy donors 4.0 Desktop Support Technician | Sterling Heights, MI | Jul 3, 2018 Decent job, your coworkers are what makes it. First of all, this is not a bad place to work. Everyone that works here is really nice and we all get along and that is what really makes this job tolerable. Most of the donors are pretty nice too and you quickly establish casual work friendships. The overall atmosphere is really laid back, even when we get busy. The pay could be better, but, as I said, this is not a hard job and the center is not overly/constantly busy. I currently make $12.24 as donor support. I think reception makes about the same and phlebotomists make $13 and some change, so you won't get rich. However, it seems like management is more than willing to move you up and give you opportunities to better yourself if you are a hard and reliable worker. Now, for the things that I don't care for... I guess my biggest \"con\" would be that direct deposit takes longer than normal to set up. I have been there a month and received two paper checks, both of which were late because they come by FedEx. So, be warned, if you are in a tight spot or wanting a job that has a reliable and established direct deposit ASAP or hands you your check Friday morning, this might not be the job for you. Also, you cannot donate for the first 60 days when you start. However, when you can begin to donate again, you get a straight $50 every time (regardless of your weight) plus any end of the month bonuses. So, that is really nice. Secondly, when I started they were understaffed and beginning to get busy so I feel like I was rushe...more 1.0 Licensed Practical Nurse | Chattanooga, TN | Nov 4, 2014 Do not apply ! I was a Medical Staff Associate/ LPN for CSL Riverside Drive for a year and a half. This was a horrible environment to say at least. People line up in the cold or rain for up to 1 hour to sell their blood plasma. Some donors refuse to use the kiosk machine to answer their questionares.. A lot of the time the kiosk machines freeze and nothing as ever done about that. Then they may stand in line once inside the front area. They do this because a lot of the donors are homeless, unemployed on drugs (crack for example), just got out of jail. The donors are mostly all ugly hateful creatures some most evil monsters. The donors are mad at the world because they are there selling blood plasma. The needle to draw the plasma is huge and the process is painful. One donor died within 6 hours of donating. One donor urinated in the trash can during his donation. The manager 's wants every person to donate even though more than 50% should not donate plasma for their own health problems, examples are stroke, diabetes, or signs or symptoms of a disease. He will constantly groom all the staff to accept everyone against the FDA and CSL Plasma's own Medical Reference Guide. My co-workers were back stabbers. The techs are pay min wage or about that and most new employees are soon gone. Over 40 people came and went during my employement there. If a donor makes it to the medical screnning part 1/2 fail of the donors fail for high blood pressure, pulse or a temp of 99.7 or out of range HCT % or pro...more Prosits was horrible! Consmangement unethical FDA should get involved and go undercover 2.0 Phlebotomist | Gresham, OR | May 17, 2015 High Productive Environment, Low wages, Low Staffing, Uknown Time Release This place is a mess. Been working there for quite sometime that I don't even bother learning names of new employees. This place is a ridiculous revolving door that the amount of employees that work there which in my opinion should be enough for opening and closing the center I'm surprised were constantly under staffed. Too many people wanting to work mornings that they accommodate too many people to work mornings so were shorthanded at night. Some of the management act clueless to the unhappiness of their employees when it comes to the low wages and living paycheck to paycheck that I feel they don't try and initiate change in the wages. They reward the wrong people for the positions provided. You can get away with improper work policies if your friends with management they'll act like it never happened. If its not documented it never happened as they say. High traffic of people that are clearly on an unknown substance shouldn't donate but somehow manage to pass their vitals. Some of the co-workers are fun to work with but some just make it bad for others by gossiping too much and hardly work but collect a paycheck and try to leave early from work. Some days are good some are a bit over whelming that were all in a frenzy trying to do our best in a fast paced environment but in a timely manner with low amount of employees. Surprised there hasn't been a mass walk out with an employees strike attached to it. I've seen employees quit without notice by them grabbing their stuff o...more ProsFlexible schedule, learn new skills without going to school for it, Good job for anyone going to school, able to work their and donate ConsHigh demand with little pay, too many politics, can get away with just about anything without consequence if your friends with management, poor management, revolving door turnover rate, too favortism, unstable work environment, managment with secret agends 3.0 Phlebotomist | Spokane, WA | Mar 17, 2019 Good to start This company is a good place to start a career in the medical field but I didn't stay because of lack of competitive compensation and lack of ability to have a set schedule were a problem. We were constantly being short staffed and management had trouble with scheduling people to cover shifts properly as well as being scheduled to close and then open the next day- a lot. They almost never try to call people in early or to cover a shift- in the 8 months I was there, they called people maybe 3 times while we were constantly short staffed. Our end of the year numbers showed that lack of coverage in longer wait times for the donors against our sister center in Spokane Valley. I did move quickly from being an entry level receptionist, for which they fully trained me with no experience to begin, to being a donor floor technician and then becoming a certified phlebotomist. However, I had to be very pushy to do so and, in some cases, doing what I think is abandoning my post up front to sneak out onto the floor to be trained further. I basically had to fight to be cross trained even though the center director always says he wants everyone to know all the areas. When I went through a divorce and had to change my daycare plans for my youngest suddenly, they were not willing to work with me to have a more set schedule to have more stability while I dealt with my sudden life upheaval. Also, they were almost constantly changing the rules as to what we could and could not do in which order ...more ProsGood to start, training available, decent co-workers ConsUnderstaffed, scheduling issues, micromanagement 1.0 Phlebotomist | Federal Way, WA | Sep 22, 2018 Horrible Place to Work! Not Worth It! Working for CSL Plasma was one of the worst jobs that I have ever had. The lies that management tells you to keep you in the job (promising you your phlebotomy certification), the straight up rude and incompetent leaders (managers and supervisors), and the poor excuse for pay (minimum wage starting, then maybe 3 dollars increase max) are some of the many reasons I had to give up on this job. Let me warn you by saying they DO NOT HIRE PHLEBOTOMISTS OUTRIGHT. If you are a phlebotomist already who has a license, this is not a place that you want to work. They will interview you for the phlebotomy position but will hire you as a receptionist or a \u201cdonor support tech\u201d then whenever they want to they\u2019ll either promote you or have you be in competition with other employees to be hired as a phlebotomist. Management is an absolute joke... it all consists of former fast food workers who were somehow put in a position of power over others. Favoritism is rampant and it\u2019s common practice to put employees down rather than bring them up. If you are looking to become a part of the management team you had better become friends and subordinates with the current management. They don\u2019t increase pay for cross training, becoming a designated trainor, and they don\u2019t increase your wage relative to reflect new hires. Some people were there for years and new hires would start off higher than them. The wages they provide are not liveable and a joke compared to actual phlebotomist wages. ...more ProsIf you like low pay, rude donors and staff, and having no life outside of work THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!

Certain individuals call in all the time and get by with it, others rarely work -- stand around and visit most of the day and get by with it. Spouses and signaficant others are not supposed to be able to work in the same center together however this center allows it if you are in that click. The management folks are on the lazy side except for the center manager. If she is working at the center she will be out on the floor helping in all areas, but the rest of them are sitting on their rear ends in the office texting on their cell phones which is prohibited by their own policy. Don't trust anyone at this facility! While they may pretend to be your friend to your face the majority of them are snitches! Will rat you out for anything and everything you do. Not supposed to have cell phones in any production area, but the \"special group\" nearly always has theirs on them. Not supposed to chew gum in production areas, but you always see a certain supervisor sucking on mints and smacking them around like gum -- which should be the same as the no gum rule. Not supposed to eat in production areas but numerous employees have food stashed everywhere. Not a good place to work! High turnover because if you don't get in the click they will pick on you until they can find something to fire you for or make something up to fire you for! Nurses are on the bottom of the totem pole ...more Prosgreat place for lgbt-- especially this center Consnot a great place if you respect the traditional family values, not beyond high school mentality. 3.0 Receptionist | Bloomington, MN | Aug 11, 2019 Beware the people in line. Beware the reception management. People go to CSL Plasma to sell their plasma. They are there because they want/need money and they want it now. Many are desperate. Some are too sick to donate. Some lie. Some just count on this as their regular income. They don't like to wait. But before they can \"donate\" they have to answer a computer server, meet with a reception technician to get their vitals taken and have their blood tested to make sure they are healthy and make sure they haven't \"donated\" too recently or are homeless. At this point, they can be stopped in the process at any point. It usually doesn't go well if that happens. Gang tattoos, drug marks, too overweight to have blood pressure taken, blood pressure too high or low, dehydration - all reasons for denial. Not good news for desperate people. Then they have to stand in line to wait for an empty bed in a cold room (cold preserves the plasma) while a tech puts a needle in there arm to suck out blood, run it through a machine, separate the plasma, and put the rest of the blood back in. If that goes too slow, the \"donor\" is disconnected and they don't get paid. I worked in the front answering questions from people who wanted to learn about what the process is like to computer errors, to screening (and denying) people before they got to the donation room. My training should have taken 6 weeks. At 6 months, it still wasn't complete because the company decided to open a new storefront so those people were pushed ahead.
