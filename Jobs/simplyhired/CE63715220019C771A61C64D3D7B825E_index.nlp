PA Overall Reviews at Estes Express Lines 2.0 Driver | Fort Myers, FL | Jun 22, 2019 Fair warning! I started in August 2018. I had a great interview with the terminal Manager and felt a good culture vibe from the start despite the terminal being very ragged,old and just dirty. The Job is like any other p and d job for the most part except the freight is junk and damaged 90% of the time. You are expected to try and pawn it off on the customer unless its broken glass. Most of the trucks and trailers are junk with the exception of a few. The supervisor is a former driver and really tries to do a good job although he is still learning as he goes. The culture changes over time and becomes stressful when your driving junk and delivering junk freight. So to wrap up the review and why I departed. I put in for three in paid days off (which were denied). There were two drivers scheduled off on one of the days(plus the terminal manager)and only one the other two. I was willing to be reprimanded for the days because my son was graduating high school out of state and it wasn't an option to miss(I had no paid days left due to moving and retrieving belongings from out of state). When I returned I was asked to go to the terminal managers office and told this was my sixth unexcused absence and grounds for termination. I was never informed of 1,2 or 3 although the policy is a coaching after 3. I was told the 3rd absence occurred on May 3 and I never received a coaching. I asked the terminal manager why I didnt receive the coaching which occurred almost 30 days prior he told me he didn't kn...more ConsNO Overtime till 52(you'll never get it). 4.0 Human Resources Manager | Dallas, TX | Oct 2, 2012 Great Company Great Company, Over 80 years of family owned business: I was employed as a Regional Human Resource Manager in a 12 state area, traveling 40-70% of the time. \u2022 Consulted Executive Leadership in areas related to employment policies and procedures, diversity, employee morale, business initiatives, local, state and federal personnel laws. \u2022 Managed all aspects of HR functional areas including HR operations; employee relations; employment/staffing and recruitment; compensation; benefits; training and development; and company sponsored programs. \u2022 Coordinated all payroll and compensation functions \u2022 Managed the Benefit Analysis and selection processes; served as the custodian of all Benefit related duties \u2022 Managed all areas of Recruiting/Staffing, Succession and Retention Planning \u2022 Managed all areas related to Employee Relations, including discipline/termination implementation \u2022 Partnered with the assigned strategic business organization management team to assist in optimizing people, strategy, structure, process and culture, and to facilitate the liaison/delivery of HR services as appropriate. \u2022 Communicated and ensured compliance and consistency with corporate and HR related policies and acted as the first line resource to managers and employees on employee relation\u2019s issues and partnered with them to implement solutions. \u2022 Served as an advocate to employees.

The work, processes, and freight realities are the same across the industry; just different equipment colors and varied vernacular that is company specific. It's nearly impossible to get valid financial and operational data via 3rd party analysis on a privately owned company like Estes, but I can say that every year the annual \"state of the company\" address from the CEO is always a positive one over the past five years -- good raises, new equipment purchases, continued growth is on an upward trend. Nothing cutting edge here, just \"tried and true\" ways to doing things. Regarding technology, Estes is definitely a relative laggard, but is going into that direction: electronic logs in place for about 4 years; electronic P&D applications just got upgraded a year ago; electronic dock system is expanding... The company ought to invest in long term professional development of their managerial staff instead of just recycling people from other competitors. If strong company specific philosophy & processes existed, the company wouldn't have to rely on the talent of the individual which is very rare to find -- instead, building a solid process template and filling it with average people (which are plentiful) would diminish turnover at the sup/ops mgr. level which really negatively impacts the operation in terms of performance, customer trust/loyalty, and subordinate moral....more Prosgood compensation Consbelow average quality (freight handling) 3.0 Account Manager | Middletown, NY | Jun 26, 2012 GOOD OLD BOY CORPORATE STRUCTURE GOOD OLD BOY CORPORATE MENTALITY .BACK STABBING MANAGEMENT DOES NOT WORK WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS (BY DESIGN). FIRE DRILL SHORT TERM GOALS, OPERATION MANAGEMENT DOES NOT MAINTAIN BASIC STANDARDS. HANDLING, SERVICE, AND DAMAGES ARE ALWAYS ISSUES DESPITE COMPANY POLICIES. CUTTING CORNERS TO MAKE MONEY IS THE BOTTOM LINE.. .THE COMPANY TRIES TO RUN A LEAN OPERATION AND IT BACKFIRES FOR BEING TOO LEAN. ITS HARD TO SELL THE SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS BECAUSE WHAT THEY EXPERIENCE IS NOT WHAT THE COMPANY PREACHES HARDEST THING ABOUT WORKING AT ESTES IS TRYING TO MAINTAIN A CUSTOMER BASE BECAUSE OF SERVICE ISSUES. THEIR IS BASICALLY A GOOD WORKFORCE OF DRIVERS. MOST OF THE SLACKERS WILL LEAVE OR BE TERMED.

I was promised when I got the job that I would be made full time after my 90 day probationary period, however it is now 3 years after my probationary period and I still get less than 30 hrs a week on average. I was told I would have opportunity to move up. Spoke to terminal manager about this and he pretty much told me \"whatever\". They make it difficult for other employers to check references by charging them to just verify that you work there, as I have tried to get a new job and they have refused to pay this fee. I will say that I am satisfied with the hourly rate of pay, unfortunately I essentially do a supervisor's job but get no benefits and typically around 30 hrs a week. This company is afraid of their drivers going union, so they get most of what they ask for, but everyone else is expendable. They give managers bonuses for keeping cost down, and to do this they take it out on everyone except the drivers. They expect me to be able to do the cleanup work and other tasks of the shift before me while also doing everything else they want done in the same number of hours I need to do my own job. If you are a driver I would recommend this company as the drivers get somewhat stellar treatment. If not I would implore you to avoid this company unless you do not currently have a job and ...more Proshourly pay is fair Consthey cut your hours whenever possible, rendering the pro above pointless, no respect from management 3.0 Driver | Winchester, VA | Jun 3, 2019 Don't Get Hurt on the Job Here They will try everything in there power to give you no help medically past there expectations to get you better. Then when they do they ask you to sign a paper that you can never return to work for the company if you do get better. They over load there trailers and lift gates. They tell you figure out some way of getting your job done, but don't care if it's not OSHA safe. Putting 3000 lbs Electrical wire as tall and as wide as the trailer and expect you to put it on a lift gate. When you pull it on the lift gate the dolly has to hang off as the top is tipping forward. The dock over loads the ends of the trailers when you get to your first destination and open the your lucky if it don't just fall when the door is open. I didn't mind the work just the idiot calls from a superior when asked to do something unsafe. I showed up on time and rain when there was bad conditions most would call off. When i step in front of something that was about to fall on customer my back got hurt and they turned there backs on me when i needed them most. They put me on light duty which caused my back to take twice as long to heal. When the doctor said it would be a year or two before i see any sign in relief from my back. they wanted nothing to do with me. Doctors gave me 30-40% disability to my back and they let me go. Gave me option of a settlement but i could never work for them in my life again. The way the acted I done knew they wasn't going to let me work there again.

When I initially started there was an appreciative atmosphere where everyone seemed to love their jobs. We worked together and got what needed to be done, done. Fast forward a few months and management changes. Work piles up and daily there were meetings about mandatory OT and mandatory 6 days. During these meetings management would berate every employee for any millisecond of idle time and threaten to terminate anyone for even having their phone in their pockets. Despite this negative culture at the riverside terminal, I endured and got paid. They pay very well. However one manager in particular would always find a way to write me up, despite it not being his department. He would go out of his way to find something and write me up for things previous supervisors and managers didn't write me up for. Then one day while asleep for work, the ATM called me and suspended me without giving me a reason. I called back and pleaded for an explanation and received nothing until I was called and terminated without an explanation. To make a long story short. You will work, and you will hustle and you will get paid but they seemingly decide to clean house on the regular. I've seen it happen multiple times before it happened to me. The least they could have done is talked to me about why I was terminated. I gave a lot of my time and energy to this company and all for an abrupt termination over the phone and with no explanation whatsoever. ProsGood pay, great coworkers Consfavoritism, excessive OT, destructive attitudes from managament 1.0 Driver | Normal, IL | Apr 28, 2016 Not a good work place I was a P&D driver for 4 years. The management changed six months after I started there. That is when things slowly started going down hill. The last to years i was there Management Started playing the favorites game. They have different rules for every driver. If Management don't like you forget about having a home life they will work you 14 hr a day.They will give you every reason why you can not have a day off. If you need to go see a doctor. Plan on calling in sick the day of your appointment so you can make it. Management makes up things to call you in the office to wright you up for something. If you go to work there just hope you do not get injured on the job. Then they will make things ruff on you just to get you to quit. The day i decided to leave there is the day the Operations manager looked me in the eye and said ( WHY DON'T YOU JUST QUIT) . They pushed a driver that was there for 12 yr hard enough that he moved along to a better place to work. Not to long after he left there were 3 driver in 3 weeks walked out the door I was one of them. One driver left without having a job to go to. Yes it is that bad. 4 weeks after the 3 of us left another driver had enough and walked out without a job to go to. So If you are out of work and need a some money coming in. I say take the job and keep looking for another job. If you have a job and looking to better your self. I would pass this job up and keep looking. Because if you start working there it will not be to much longer...more ProsNONE ConsEverything bad that you can imagine. 2.0 Senior Customer Support Representative | California | Nov 2, 2018 Its ok... As a 20 something-year-old college student, this job was great money. I'm getting paid almost double what my peers make and I'm gaining good professional experience with it. Manager was super flexible with my hours and as long as you get your work done and can be relied on, the management will love you. HOWEVER: If you are the type of person to care and have passion for your job (no matter what) then you'll see great disappointment in this field. The entire freight industry is based on people needing products, and you're the service that gets the product to them. No matter what you do to enforce policy (i.e., trying to get people to pay for freight charges in full, getting people to give you correct paperwork, etc.) the customer will always win. \"As long as the freight is delivered, nothing else matters\" is what I was told. They will give you the entire procedure to follow but management will not follow it if it means freight will not be delivered. This is quite unfortunate because you can see the loss of revenue right in front of your eyes- yet it doesn't matter because freight was delivered. If you're someone who just needs a job and doesn't place passion and work in the same realm, then this industry is perfect for you.

The managers daughter makes 13 dollars an hour with no experience. Only worked for fast food companys and is making more than people who have been there for over 8 years. There are a bunch of cliques and favorites in the workplace. Hell clerical was making more than me. I learned the job fast and was moved to another position within five months with no pay raise or benefits offered to me. They are rude and nasty only think of themselves. They advised a lady that waits on a ride after work that no one cam take her home or wait for her ride to get there. She has to wait at the store and get off of Estes property. There is a trailer park with scary ppl behind there so if something happens to her I smell a big law suit coming. They have no type of respect for others and they talk down on everyone. The managers are not professional they tell the whole office whats going on if someone is pulled into the office for disciplinary actions. This place is trash. They compete with Richmonds manager because shes black they try to prove her wrong for everything she does. I thought there was no I in Team. They lack team work skills.
