Not Worth It. *Note: I only worked in the Care Department. I can not speak on the GH experience in other departments/positions. The Care Department is a perfect example of how a company's culture can tank following the departure of a major player in leadership. The Care floor environment is one of favoritism and workplace bullying. The work isn't hard, (and fairly evenly distributed,) but it honestly takes a lot to have your hard work acknowledged or appreciated. The managers are under-educated, unprofessional and untrained. I never thought I would suggest this to a company, but maybe you should consider hiring your managers from the outside, and not promoting form within. It doesn't seem to be very effective. The CEO is an absent presence in the Care department, I've seen him on the Care floor interacting with customer service personnel only once in two years. Hr's only job is to support management. At no point in time should a managers' accusation against a lower-tier employee be taken as fact without any proof or corroboration, but it happens all the time, and unfortunately, it costs good employees their jobs or forces them to leave out of sheer unhappiness. The turnover rate is pretty high, so they're frequently hiring. The illusion of advancement is just that, an illusion. If you're hired on the Care floor, you die on the Care floor. Management will nitpick and micromanage you in an attempt to saddle you with disciplinary actions in order to keep you from advancing...more 3.0 Care Specialist | Chandler, AZ | May 19, 2020 If you don't like being yelled at look elsewhere... Grubhub tries to take good care of their office employees, they are always giving you free food, decent pay, and good benefits. However, you receive a lot of training in a very little time frame and are thrust straight to the phones, where you are expected to learn very quickly. They will tell you that it is okay to ask questions, over and over, but then get frustrated when you are overwhelmed and not 'getting' it. Having great multi-tasking skills is an absolute must because you have to do many things on your computer monitors while speaking with the driver/customer. I would say maybe one out of ten calls you are not being yelled at, and you will get screamed at by drivers, customers, and sometimes (though it is a little rarer) you will get yelled at by restaurants. There is also a huge language barrier between the call centers that creates a lot of chaos, especially with the drivers. The drivers are rude, mean, demanding, condescending, angry, and downright awful people to talk to. Often times you have to call them back to get screamed at again. You will often get yelled at by a driver, and a customer all on the same ticket. It is also hard to blame them, because most of the time when they call, all you can do is tell them that you are sorry. There is literally nothing you can do to satisfy them, so you sit there while they scream at you basically because they are losing money. Even the managers will tell you that the situation sucks for the driver, but there is nothing th...more ProsFree food, good benefits, decent pay ConsVery stressful, constantly being yelled at by drivers/customers, too much training not enough time to learn, frustrating managers 4.0 Inside Sales Manager | Chandler, AZ | Jun 10, 2019 In the building phase I'm writing this review based on my experience thus far; The extreme benefit of joining GrubHub in Chandler right now is the ability to get in on the ground floor and showcase your talents as we're still very young. That's where I saw my opportunity. I have yet to be let down by my superiors and anticipate growing into a very successful career. Although I believe that hungry sales people can walk into this environment and become successful quicker than ramping expectations, there's only one reason I gave a 4 star review instead of a 5; We're still in the \"building phases\" and there's a lot of learning left. I'm one of the sales managers here and still have a lot to learn myself, and that learning will impact my team and help them generate larger paychecks. If you're the type of sales professional that's extremely proactive in your own learning and have an above average level of grit and determination (while being able to silence complaints) then you'd do well here. If you're the type of salesperson that allows complaints to affect your performance, this isn't the place to come to just yet. A senior manager recently took over the office and the managers love reporting to her. She's a very determined individual and has great ideas/processes to take our office to the next level. You'll read some reviews on this site talking about \"useless KPI's\" but instead of letting those impact your decision about GrubHub, I'd propose the following question - \"What good salesp...more 5.0 Caterer | Seattle, WA | Dec 27, 2017 Wonderful management and plenty of opportunity for advancement Having read a number of reviews on here from individuals who had negative opinions of GrubHub, I felt compelled to write about my own experience with the company. I\u2019ve been a driver for 2 years now. In the time, I\u2019ve been able to climb the ladder into a more senior position in the corporate catering sector. I, like almost every other driver, started off with residential deliveries. With good ethic, professionalism and your evident commitment to the company, you\u2019ll be able to fulfill orders to businesses and get over $100 for a single delivery at times. The issue for many drivers is they expect the company to just give them work without embracing the idea of collaborative effort of growth. When you\u2019re communicative to your regional managers about problems or suggestions, it returns to you. Just like most profession, you need to make investments that will return to you- dollies, catering tools, etc. Management has been amazing. I began working in North Orange County, California, moved to the Southern zone and then transferred up to Seattle without any difficulties. Having worked in three very different regions in multiple states and numerous dispatchers, I can confidently say GH hires qualified individuals. Overall, this is a great company and keeps you in shape. ProsOpportunities for advancement, flexible hours, friendly management ConsMinor software improvements 1.0 Independent Contractor | Florida | Jun 17, 2017 Terrible. Not worth the hourly guarantee I am so disappointed with this company. They are one of the most deceitful companies I have ever worked for. #1 you are not a independent contractor. That's a fancy way of saying employee without benefits. You are assigned a driver specialist who is actually your manager. #2 in order to get the $10.00 minimum (different in all places, you have to take every order which 75% of the time is across town upward to 15 to 20 minutes away, just to deliver it 2 to 3 miles from the person. #3 They say you keep tips, haha a joke. They take the tips to make up the $10.00 minimum. #4 They lie and say you can make $25 an hour. IMPOSSIBLE. You don't get offered enough orders to do that. Terrible. #5 driver care knows nothing. You ask them any questions of substance, they say talk to your driver specialist (manager) which is a joke. They respond when they feel like it. #6 If the weather is bad and you lose signal and they send you an order, you lose your hourly pay minimum guarantee for the whole day, what a nightmare. #7 Hours are very limited and they say your a independent contractor, but you have to take all orders and never missed a scheduled block or you will be placed in the last tier and wont get hours.#8 Half the restaurants never have food ready, wasting your time. #9 You call driver care you are on hold forever. I feel so deceived by Grub Hub its sad. I wish I never wasted my time. Lesson learned. ProsPaid weekly ConsEverything else 3.0 Independent Contractor | Champaign, IL | Feb 15, 2019 Great Part Time Job Not Full Time I have been a full time Grubhub Driver for 2 years. The pau aint bad. I work in a campus town. Stude ts leave and you loose about 8 bucks an hour. I average 19 an hour when they are here. I also work 50+ hours a week. They never provided me with anything for the job and I had to buy them myself. Tax write off. Which to help you with taxes you need to write off and track all your milage. Speak with a tax preparer before you do to much. I have to figure 40% of what I make for taxes. I make about 650 a week up to 850. Now take 40% out for taxes. If you do not do a long form on your taxes, you will owe out big. I made 32k last year and owed about 7k in taxes. Just a warning. Go in with knowledge. As for the management, they will cheat you. They withheld 180 dollars on me during a bonus time with bad weather. They told me it was a typo and was neved meant to be paid out. Even though I have the messages stating what the bonus was to be. They never advised anyone and said it was a typo. You are a number to them and can easily be replaced. They do not care for the customer or the driver. Beyond those issues, I love the job. I habe medical issues and this job has been great for me to schedule doctors appointments and work when I want and as kuch or little as I want. No paid time off or benefits but they do offer an out source to a benefit program. ProsDecent Pay, Freedom of hours ConsSketchy management, poor communication 2.0 Operations Associate | Chicago, IL | Apr 3, 2018 Yikes all around not speaking for all departments as a whole but data ops is just not redeeming - not sure if the nature of the work but management style doesn\u2019t help. You exist on a \u201cpoint system\u201d and you feel like a numb robot. Your growth is determined by big data, and if you want to grow or move forward, you\u2019ll be spoke to like \u201cwell increase your \u201cpoints\u201d and we can talk.\u201d I really enjoyed my co-workers, everyone is very young and love to have a good time; there are work events and \u201cbar in office\u201d with beer, cold brew, kombucha, tons of coffee and snacks, free food days, $18 a week to buy food. This is how they balance treating employees like dirt by throwing them branded products. I would have quit in 1 month if I didn\u2019t have great co-workers, but I pushed it out exactly 1 year . But the pay is scary low, even full time I was getting paid less than $13 an hour and I was the youngest person there at 21/22. I couldn\u2019t imagine being paid that at 25 or 26\u2026.. PAY YOUR EMPLOYEES MORE. You are a multi hundred dollar company and data ops is the BACKBONE to your company?? at the end of the day when you get paid near nothing after taxes and when you try to progress you\u2019re deemed to a point system that inhibits any personal interaction and development\u2026.but you should love it because you eat pizza and drink cold brew all day. It\u2019s truly bizarre. It was fine for a 1st job and the name looked okay on my resume. Other stay away\u2014 4.0 Operations Associate | Portland, OR | Jan 29, 2020 Fun place to work, great culture, low advancement & job security Benefits here are unlike most any job out there. I started out with 9 weeks paid vacation because they purchased the company I had been working at for 7 years. $35 a week in free lunch money to order food from their service to your office. Every Friday we had a catered lunch for the whole office. The office was always well stocked with beverages, snacks, coffee, gum and other amenities. You would never go hungry if you forgot your lunch at home. Staff are incredibly friendly and collaborative in their efforts to work as a team and get the job done. Downside is incredibly low job security. Three years after they purchased the company I started out with they eliminated most employees from the transition. I do not feel they move people into roles of increasing responsibility based on merit and work ethic. Chances of moving up in the company if you are not in Chicago are slim to none. Most everyone from the transition, even managers and department leads, have moved on to other jobs or have been let go. I did get a very fair severance package and have no ill will towards the company, although I feel they waste the talents of their workers by leaving them frozen in mundane positions. 1.0 Driver | Knoxville, TN | Jun 9, 2020 Worst driving partnership out there I have been driving for 3 weeks. Still learning the ropes. They sent me notification that I have been permanently blocked from the schedule because I am not delivering fast enough and it \"appears I am most likely trying to avoid or delay deliveries to gain more driver pay like some driver do.\" No call, no email nothing to ask me what my driving habits are to try and fix anything I may have been doing wrong, since I am NEW. No they permanently block me and then have the audacity to tell me I can still deliver, just not through the schedule where you can get guaranteed driver pay. Why would I want to still partner with a company that treated me like a criminal without even talking to me first when I have no idea what they are talking about? They must be failing financially to treat drivers this way and revoke their ability to get paid through the schedule. I didn't do anything wrong but they don't care. After several emails, they still say I was trying to steal from them and have not once tried to listen to me or to see from my perspective or try to see that I didn't do anything wrong and that maybe their data is wrong. Drive for literally any other driver app. ProsNONE ConsTHE ENTIRE COMPANY 2.0 Account Manager | Chicago, IL | Dec 28, 2015 Run away. My job responsibilities changed constantly. I was only challenged in my job when I was pushed to my limit without my leaders realizing how much they were really asking. When I came in, it was a mess, and it was essentially my job to create a system for the program I worked on. It was constantly about pleasing the upper management who never actually worked with us, only demanded more. We were treated expendable and I felt, even as a full-timer, that our team would be cut any day. I never received valuable feedback or coaching, my leaders just occasionally checked in that I wasn't too burned out. The team completely changed in its business operations without warning, people were laid off, and new people came in and took over our responsibilities. Our team received little to no recognition. It is still a hot mess, and I feel bad for my former coworkers. ProsNights and weekends off (unless you work in customer service, the largest dept in the company). Decent amount of paid time off, Casual dress. Stock Options - Only good if you were hired in 2013 or earlier. No longer a benefit.
