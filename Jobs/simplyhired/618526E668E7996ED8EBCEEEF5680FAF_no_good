There seems to be none between the managers and the rest of us. The current management with the exception of the Production, Safety and QC managers do not know how to talk to people. No one seems to want to do anything about the attendance issue. You should only be able to have a total of 9 points and then you are terminated but certain people here have several points way up into the double digits and almost 3 digits. Others see this abuse of the point system and see nothing is done to this person so they start abusing this system as well. This creates a lot of chaos especially on the weekends. People seem to call off a lot on the weekend and no extra support is given. Also, not all shifts are created equal. There is TOO much favoritism here. When the bully of a plant manager sits in his office all day and watches the security footage of everyone in the break room but only says something to one shift and not the other 3, which is a problem. There are no signs whatsoever in or outside of the building stating that you are being watched on camera. The same plant manager also likes to berate the molding supervisors by playing little games with them by pitting one against the other. If one supervisor turns in numbers below the expectation of one he\u2019ll make sure and tell them how much belter the other supervisor did. We all work at the same place an do the same thing, no one should be treated different...more ProsNot too many Consfavoritism, planet manager is a bully, too many people smoke 1.0 Machine Operator | Oakley, CA | May 15, 2020 Decent pay. Insurance is horrible... Berry does not care for you as an operator, or any other production employee. Work for 14 days and get 2 days off. As Covid is going on, you will not get your 8 hours a day. They harass employees about their social distancing, but expect you to sit in on their meaningless meetings every Wednesday. Their management positions are filled with people with 30 years or more on the job (which isnt a bad thing) but you have to remember that Berry has gone through some extreme changes since they went public (investor owned) and those 30+ yr people really had nothing else as far as experience goes, so they had to bite the bullet and accept some very big losses financially while being squeezed mentally and physically for every drop the company can drain you for. As a production operator, you are going to deal with several \"lead men\" (contradictory name because they are complacent and will make the job as operator VERY difficult because they are to lazy to do theirs). I went in to my job at Berry with the ideal that I would work hard, move up and find a place where I would be satisfied with the kind of work I did. Instead, I worked hard, did a good job and got stuck in my position because they couldnt lose one of the few operators that had a work ethic. There are some difficult machines there, and IF you show them you have the drive and ability to learn them and work them correctly, you will find yourself being replaced on an easier machine (by a slug operator) so you can cover a...more 2.0 Material Handler | Evansville, IN | Dec 4, 2014 A depressing place to work Berry Plastics is a place I would recommend against working for. The pay is fairly high, but I would work three weeks straight very often. You never know if you will have weekends off until late on Friday, making it impossible to accurately plan for anything. Most of the management displays poor characteristics for those in a leadership role. They are often rude, they will put you down, they use a disgusting amount of profanity, and most of them will not aid you in any way. Unfortunately, many of the co-workers can be the same, although not to the extent as management. I was even forced to skip lunch breaks most days of the week; this continued for nearly 2 years. A typical day involved a 10 hour shift of working around machines. I cleaned them, I changed color for our parts, I recorded orders, and I was tasked with decision making in nearly every aspect of the job. However, despite all of the negatives, I did learn some incredibly useful skills. Due to the high stress and heavy workload, I can multitask a numerous amount of projects at once. These projects are typically very fast paced- the moment one begins, it should be done no later than within 10 minutes from the starting point, in most cases. I dealt with customer complaints. I had to deal subordinates complaining, and learn how to properly resolve arguments and disagreements. Finally, due to only receiving one or two days off every month, I was able to save money. Overall, I would not recommend Berry. I...more ProsGood pay, double time and time and a half are available ConsPoor management, rude co-workers, work environment is excessively hostile, 1-2 days off a month, you never know when you will work weekends 2.0 Operator | Princeton, IN | Aug 8, 2019 Upper management HR hired her incompetent, unstable son to work as a temp for the summer. She gave him weeks of time off excused for vacations from the start, even though temps are not suppose to have that much leniency on missing work. He also missed a lot for fake injuries and cost the company thousands in medical bills. If he was mad about the job he was put on, he'd have an \"injury\" and behave like a child and be treated as such. The amount of favoritism was unreal. He was hard for anyone to work with, he was lazy, and his explosive childish temper tantrums caused a very uneasy and unsafe work environment for the rest of the employees. Upper management was aware of it and nothing was ever done due to HR being his mother. Instead the rest of the employees were put under a microscope to ensure HE wasn't being treated unfair and to blame everyone else for the lack of emotional stability he had. A father and son are forbidden from working on the same shift if one of them is in an authority role but HR can hire her son to work on day shift with her and proceed to make unfair exceptions to accommodate him based on her personal reasons and his poor work ethic. He couldn't do his job and if he was any other associate, he would have been let go. 3 reportable \"injuries\" in 2 months is more than any employee temp or full time ever has had there in that time span. How can you report employee misconduct when the person you report it to is their mother? Berry has went downhill over the years due to up...more 5.0 Quality Assurance Technician | Matthews, NC | Jul 27, 2019 Great place to work they treat you like family Very good place to work would recommend to anyone looking for a steady place to work, decent pay (as long as you talk about your pay to all of your co workers and ask them about their pay to make sure they\u2019re not getting over on you),but the management team was great, extremely friendly and always made you feel like you were part of a family. Only bad thing is that they get over a lot of people with their pay,the pay needs to be discussed amongst the employees. It seems like everyone is embarrassed to talk about how much money they make, which isn\u2019t right because then the company can easily get away with paying everyone much different for the same positions and experience but the company doesn\u2019t want anyone to know that. None of the Machine Operators make the same amount of money, same goes with the Packers. I was in the Quality Department and I absolutely loved my job, I strived each and everyday to always do better and be more efficient. I had been in the department for a long time, doing the best I could everyday, always putting in 110%. We got a new guy in the department, that I had to train pretty much babysit, he didn\u2019t care about the job or the department just the paycheck, always on his phone. I found out a long time after I had been pulling my weight and his weight he was making over 2$ an hour more than me (and I was doing his work). This is one of the biggest reasons the pay needs to be an open discussion, there\u2019s no reason to be embarrassed to discuss something t...more 3.0 Material Handler | Mankato, MN | Aug 29, 2019 not the best place to be This is for the Mankato location. 12 hour rotating shifts / 4 weeks day shift, 4 weeks night shift this was the work schedule before i left in this specific order: (2 days on, 2 days off, 3 days on, 2 days off, 2 days on, 3 days off) then the work cycle repeats i was first a film tech, then a material handler. film tech consists of removing the film from the machines, weighing the film, then entering the data into the computer. Material handler places film onto pallets, use boards and bands to secure it, then wrap it with a wrapping machine. Material Handler position also includes loading material into trucks (if they give you a forklift license), working in basement, moving pallets of resin closer to the plastic making machines work flow is erratic at best. there are days where you do close to nothing, then there are days where you don't if you will get a break. When i left there, they were going through a VERY slow time (which some senior employees said was highly unusual, and worrisome)... during my time, the amount of people working on each shift was dropped from 16 to 11 because of this, they sent people home on the weekends, or sent people to the press dept for less hours. Management does not communicate with supervisors. one harassment incident occurred while i was there, and before i left, management still had not fired the harasser because they cared more about making the plastic than they did making sure their employees were safe. ProsOT is 2x, 3x is working on holidays, occasional paid meal Consmanagement, lack of communication, no room for advancement, disorganization is rampant 1.0 Process Technician | Evansville, IN | Mar 17, 2015 full of contradictions As a thermoforming technician at Berry Plastics, the moral in the past year has gone down quite a bit. We were on a 21 day schedule and able to get over time any time that we wanted and weekends were based by seniority. This past year we have been placed on a 10 days on and off for 2 days in the attempt to \"improve our family time\". The only time that seniority matters now is on holidays and when you put in for vacations. The moral has made an incredible downward spiral and our manager has stated \"If you don't like it here then quit\". With the new schedule, it is not worth the money. If I were to demote to an operator and work 2 weeks straight, I would make the same amount of money I am making working my 10 days in a row. I believe that even the operators are about to be forced onto a 12 hour rotation. I enjoy working with other people and have made many friends. It really is a team based job when things go wrong. You rely on one another to complete tasks and get a machine operating again. The hardest part about the job is probably the sheer boredom on most days. When machines are operating at full potential you are literally standing around and watching conveyors. On bad days its a sweat fest. Cutting sheet and doing technical processing on machines to get it running to the point you can stand around and watch conveyors. The most enjoyable part of the job is the compensation and going home at the end of the night. Prosbenefits, 401k, subway in break room Conshot, busy and slow seasons, barely any weekends off, doesnt offer as much overtime 1.0 Inspector/Packer | Streetsboro, OH | Nov 1, 2018 Absolutely horrible. Did not care for employees or their family issues. I have a daughter with a very low immune system, creating doctors visits continuously, never being granted to take care of my daughter. I have a diabetic husband who severely struggles with maintaining a balanced blood sugar. I asked for a day off to take care of him due to almost going into what you call a diabetic coma and if not treated quickly can lead to possible death. I asked on multiple occasions for my FMLA papers and never received. I was then fired due to my husband almost slipping into one and needed to take him to the emergency room immediately. His blood sugar was at 1000. Meaning his blood would turn to poison. Management never cared and always racial and verbally abuses me with the \u201cwhite privileged\u201d I was white so that automatically made me wrong and shut me down on everything. I was never granted the pay time off that I asked for they gave me whatever days they wanted. Pay was okay but for working 20-30 hours 7 days a week never had extra money to take care of extra Necessities Like doctor visits or the emergency room visits. I never had time for my family anymore. I was not allowed a life out of Barry global. When being fired I was not talked to face to face like a human they left me a voicemail stating I was no longer and employee cause I cared more for my family. I rarely asked for days off unless it was absolutely critical. EXTREMELY RACIST!!! ProsBenefits only ConsEverything else. No one had any moral support for their over worked employees 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Montvale, NJ | Jul 27, 2019 Horrible Training, Unhappy Atmosphere The training in Customer Service is horrible & unprofessional, you are trained by a few different people and they all do things very differently - this leads to confusion and becomes stressful for a new hire. They push you on the floor too quickly. I was told we'd get 'intensive training', it was anything but. Training modules that are mostly a waste of time, and you sit with different people for a few days and that's it. It's very fast paced, but you can't work fast when you are not 100% certain of what you are doing. You'll get massive amounts of emails every day from sales reps who are sometimes confused too. They need to take time to train new hires properly, make sure they really know what to do & how to do it. The system you work on, JDE is outdated. Black screens with light text - very hard on the eyes. The office looks a bit run down too - you can tell corporate does not think highly of their Customer Service department, no money is pumped into it. People are worried about loosing their jobs. The old timers are not happy and feel frustrated. The building is just a quarter full with people, it's a ghost town in there. However, most of my co workers were very nice, and seemed like a great group of people. I left because I saw no future here. It's a very unhappy place with very high turnover - constantly looking to hire and a lot of job fairs. They need to look inward to fix what's wrong, then they would retain people. I doubt this department will stay in NJ. 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Montvale, NJ | May 15, 2019 No job security, too much lay offs. Everyone is stressed since there is no job security regardless of how hard you work or how long you been at the company; you can get fired and laid off with no notice or warning. There are constant job fairs because the turnover is so high at the company especially for the customer service roles, since management is disorganized, and plays favorites; they will treat you like a cog in a machine instead of a person; your basically replaceable so they make you know it everyday. People are pushed to their limits on purpose so you can either quit or they lay you off, so they don't have pay retirement or any other benefits. You will constantly observe management favoring other employees while bullying others but, everyone is scared for their jobs so they do nothing about it. I complained to human resources multiple times about employees being treated horribly with harassment, prejudice, racism, and discrimination through unprofessional, verbal and physical conduct, which created a toxic and unsafe environment. I don't recommend anyone working there unless, you want your happiness, striped from you piece by piece until your shell of your former self. ProsNone ConsHigh turnover, no job security, harassment, prejudice, favoritism, bad management etc. Questions And Answers about Berry Global, Inc If you were in charge, what would you do to make Berry Global, Inc a better place to work?
