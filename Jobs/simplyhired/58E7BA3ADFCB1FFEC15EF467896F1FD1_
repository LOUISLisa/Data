I worked in the West Salem Jamba and the manager at the time wasn't a good person. She is no longer the manager, or even at the store so I cannot say much about the overall flow of the store now, but I will share my expeirnece. I started as a crew member and was promised a lot of advancememt and pay raises at the time. My manager promised me a $1.00 raise within the first 6 months, and I only received a $0.25 raise due to minimum wage being increased. I was promoted twice while working there and did not receive a pay raise for either promotion. My manager only gave raises to those she liked the most, not their work ethic but them as a person. We had one girl who always buttered up to the manager and brought her treats. She received three raises in four months of working even though she did the least amount of work on the whole crew. She also had first pick of the schedule, even though the rest of us were just assigned what was avalible. I loved my co-workers, we all became close very quickly. Sometimes people would group up together over a shift and make almost a clique type environment which was annoying at times but we all got along. Tips were basically non existent due to the over priced drinks, and when the store was tipped, it was split by hours worked at the end of the week. Meaning if you worked 10% of the hours in the store for the week, you get a dime out of every dollar tipped to the store. This is a job where you should expect to constantly be movi...more 4.0 Team Member | Simi Valley, CA | Mar 12, 2019 Great as a first job to get you through high school and community college, but not if you're working for a living wage outside of management. Jamba Juice is phenomenal for those with limited work experience. The work pace is anywhere between relaxed or managebly busy, so it's good for building some rush-resistance while not being a nightmare. That being said, if you're looking for a livable wage here, you really should start at 16-18 years old because working your way to a proper management position is a competitive slog. Going from team member to shift-lead only takes months if you're a good worker, but from shift lead to assistant manager, I've seen people quit in a rage after being a shift lead for 1-2 years and passed up for the AM position. As a team member, the expectations were reasonable for the pay, but shift leads only get an automatic raise of a dollar, which is not worth the plethora of responsibilities and expectations that get added onto your workload, so I purposely avoided and turned down the shift lead opportunity while working there for a year and a half. The responsible, level-headed, and capable people always were the ones to get into management, so I never really had complaints until my most recent manager before quitting, but honestly her expectations were reasonable; more stringent than the previous managers? Yes, but I was unfairly judging her at the time. That being said, most managers are young adults as well, so they're completely understanding and empathetic of the personal needs of their employees most of the time. The hardest times at the job were of course during the after...more Pros50% discount up to a 16$ value on consumables, 30% discount for merchandise, healthcare options, stock options, 401K, relaxed working environment ConsShort breaks, limited hours, limited and highly competitive promotion opportunities above shift-lead, minimum wage, limited raises 2.0 Shift Manager | Colorado | Sep 22, 2019 Exactly what you'd expect of a bankrupt company I started working here in 2016 because I was a college student and wanted some extra cash. I learned very quickly that nobody really cared about the job, and did just enough work to not be fired. As much as I made a lot of friends working here, I remember the pictures my coworkers would post after quitting: usually an all-caps \"FREEDOM!\". As a shift supervisor, I did most of the work even though I had a group of five team members on the clock. They would mostly stand around while they watched me make drinks and ring up orders. Despite asking for help and lecturing, it was like pulling teeth. I get why they wouldn't care; they were being paid minimum wage and treated horribly by upper management. Didn't even get a free drink every shift, like every other barista job I've had! I also NEVER got a break, even during 9 hour shifts! The training is pathetic. I remember my lack of training, and three weeks into the job I realized I had been doing many things wrong when someone bothered to correct me. Some things which could have killed someone had they been allergic! I was always told by upper management that they were going to stop by and check up on our team, but never made it. There even came a point when I was positive my manager was stealing from the store, but upper management did nothing. This is a job for a high schooler who has no idea yet how they should be treated at work. You will make some friends and the work really isn't that difficult, but you will be comp...more ProsMade friends, air conditioning, smells nice ConsNO BREAKS, horrible pay, no free food, bad management, high employee turnover rate, bad training 5.0 Team Member | Los Angeles, CA | Feb 22, 2020 Best part-time job I have had A typical day consists of making smoothies, cleaning around, prepping fruits, washing dishes, cashier duty, and restocking things as needed. Anyone who is motivated can learn the ropes quickly. Most workers at my store got along well and became at the very least, work friends. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people you get along with and if you're lucky, having a good manager. This is a great job for students or just anyone who requires a flexible schedule, and managers often accommodate for your needs. Some stores also have outings together from time to time which can be fun. Most shifts consist of only two people, which is fine for a store that is not very busy, but can be harder than necessary if working with people who do not have a good work ethic. One problem I have noticed at Jamba is that people are often hired or promoted for the sole reason of filling in a gap. This has many effects on the team that I will not go into detail about, but it is an issue. Out of the four managers I have had, only my current manager makes me feel that she genuinely wants to help and is there to work. Another issue I have noticed is management taking long to resolve store issues. A personal issue would be that I often feel underappreciated, including by management. Side note: I have worked here almost three years, often the person who has to pick up people's slack, and was denied a pay raise the one time I ever worked up the courage to ask for one. This, after si...more 2.0 Team Member | Salinas, CA | Oct 24, 2019 Draining Making smoothies isn't too hard and the recipes are fairly similar so it's extremely easy to become a good team member; however, things become 10x harder when people aren't picking up their own slack. I loved my manager she's the best one i've had (and i've had over 6) but you'll see after a while of working here that people take advantage of how chill she is. Jamba can get extremely busy especially when it's hot out which is expected. With over 30 orders and only 4 blenders things can become very hectic very fast; especially when we have people just not showing up for shifts. Many people that work here call out of shifts just because they feel like it which leads to a ripple effect of having to call in people or people working overtime. I enjoyed working here until it seemed like every 6 hour shift turned into an 8 hour shift and even having situations where a 6 hour has turned into an 11 hour shift because people getting payed more than me just don't \"feel like\" coming in. It's very easy to get promoted here but only because they are desperate for shift leaders so they take anyone that wants more pay which has led to a lot of shift leads not wanting the extra responsibility but taking the extra pay. We surprisingly don't get many rude customers and mainly only get complaints about changes corporate makes that is outside of our control.

It\u2019s a job. That\u2019s really all I can say. It\u2019s pretty fast paced, so you\u2019re expected to hit the ground running and know the ropes (and recipes) in a day or two. Starting is minimum wage ($7.25) and if you happen to get a raise after a couple of months, it\u2019ll bump you up to $7.50. (The only \u201cbenefit\u201d you\u2019ll get from this job is half price smoothies.) On a busy day, you clock in and jump right to work, but on light days, you\u2019re still expected to make yourself appear busy by cleaning or reorganizing (even if you did clean the same area just 30 minutes prior). Phones are not permitted- if you get caught once it\u2019s likely a warning, but if happens again- expect to be sent home. This job is hard on the feet. Long periods (6 hours, sometimes more) are spent on your feet with no time/ place to sit down. A 30 minute break is only permitted if you have worked at least 6 hours that day. Management... is not the best. It was like they had bipolar personalities and each day I came in was a coin toss. Although the managers usually treated me with respect personally in my time there, I couldn\u2019t say the same for the majority of my coworkers. Some felt demeaned while others were blatantly cursed out. It seemed like there way always some behind the scenes drama going on that mainly stemmed from the fact that the amount of work & way we got treated for doing our job was probably not worth the $7.25/ hour we were getting paid. But hey, money is money- that\u2019s the attitude of management. And if you\u2019...more 4.0 Team Member | Camarillo, CA | Oct 21, 2018 Fun workplace but can be stressful at times When you first start working, one thing that the manager pushes is that you learn the recipes! It might seem hard at first, but a lot of the smoothies have similar ingredients so it starts getting easier. After or during your shift, you can get a \u201cshift meal\u201d which could be either a smoothie or bowl. You get a 33% off discount, and my store actually gave us all a gift-card type of thing that reloaded with $25 each month for us to spend in store. The environment is really fun and relaxed, aside from the frequent rushes of people we\u2019d get throughout the day. Our store was located across the street from a high school, so we got flooded with annoying teenagers at 3 o\u2019clock every day. My coworkers were all super fun and nice, and I\u2019m still friends with them even though I\u2019m not working there anymore. So expect to make some friends! My manager was the only person I really had a problem with. He wasn\u2019t super nice, and he wasn\u2019t afraid to tell you what he\u2019s thinking. The other store managers in the area were fun and laid back. I worked here while in high school and I have to say they are super flexible with hours. If I needed extra time off, it was really easy to get coverage. If I had school activities, he\u2019d give me those days off and it wasn\u2019t a problem. During finals, I wasn\u2019t scheduled to work so that was pretty cool. If you want more hours, just ask and you\u2019ll most likely get them.

I juiced fresh squeezed orange juice which i thought they should peel the orange and blend them saving more money and wheat grass and had to make sure the manger and shift leaders knew they were fresh if they were busy worrying about profits doing their job as a corporation. One of my complaints where if the produce was grown with chemical fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides. I had to create the smoothies from the brand equity recipe list and modify them if asked by consumer. I had to wash the smoothie blenders within a three sink cleaning routine of dumping the waste into the drain, washing it with soap water and a scrub, then dipping it in sanitized water and sometimes bleach, due to old fruit mixes in blenders and certain supplement mixes innovation of cleaning products. That was something I had problems with as I wanted to use organic soap, and strong diluted liquor water for cleaning. I had to speak to customers while they wait on their interests and current work and how Jamba can help promote their work and hobbies. I had to find ways to promote Jamba juice which where legal and innovative. I had to clean the store for the next day of business with team members and boss. Prosgreat tasting smoothies, friendly people Conslow pay 4.0 Warehouse Lead | Fresno, CA | Jan 2, 2019 Easy, fun, great customers! A typical day at work isn't just making smoothies, there's a lot of cutting fruit, making sure things don't expire, CLEANING. If you don't like to clean do not work at Jamba Juice, we clean everything, multiple times a day, everyday! We're working with fruit here, so I get it. Things go bad quick, so we're constantly throwing stuff away, it's such a waste. It's a smoothie place, so we get a lot of fitness people going in, who usually want you to customize their drink, that gets annoying sometimes, but that's what Jamba is known for. All the stores in my area have a great staff, everyone is usually down to Earth, but I can't speak for other places. Management is cool too, but the way to get promoted is to have a DIFFERENT manager interview you and train you, which doesn't make too much sense. Other managers don't see how employees work on the regular, so often with this system people don't get promoted as quickly as they should. Jamba is usually minimum wage, and it's not often you get a raise unless you are promoted and even the jump to lead or keyholder from just a team member is only a few cents. It is a very easy job though, the customers are usually great! Overall it's great, I'd recommend people looking for a low effort, part-time to apply. Pros50% off Cons10min break 4.0 Shift Leader | Dallas-Fort Worth, TX | Mar 9, 2019 If you have a god manager and a good work ethic, this is a great job for you. I currently am a Shift lead, in training to become a general manager, and I have to say that I fully loved the experience here. Just like any fast food job, you will have your good and bad moments with customers, your boss, and other employees, but it always gets better if you care about your job. It's easy to get time off and you get free drinks on and 50% off menu items when you're off the shift. It's been over a year now that I have been employed here and I love the experience I have gotten from it. Though I can understand that the best job in the world can be really bummy if you have a terrible leader deligating you. So I say stay positive and try it out. If you don't like it, that's fine, but ask is it because of the work or the people. Because when I finally got a good manager working here and a good, or at very least, an understandable group of team members, the job because my favorite job I've had in a long time. ProsFree drinks when you work and 50% off when you don't, Easy to get time off with proper communication. Consunless you're mamagement, you dont get to work mroe than 40 hours a week, doesn't pay much, on slower days you may lose your hours because they have to control labor.

Good communication and a cheerful attitude is required so everything runs really smoothly.

There is a lot of yelling across the room, loud blenders, and joking going on amidst the chaos. If you enjoy fast environments and a good time, Jamba Juice at Downtown Disney is the place for you.
