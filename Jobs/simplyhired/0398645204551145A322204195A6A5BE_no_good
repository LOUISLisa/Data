Like any other store envirnoment. Staff employed longer than 4 years are on a good salary, starting salary quite low now. Co-workers very pleasent. Free tea. ProsStaff discount ConsNo set hours 1.0 Seasonal Associate | White Rose, KY | Nov 29, 2019 Bullying/ everyone has their gangs I thought it would be nice working in Debenhams as I absolutely loved shopping there. However as soon as I got on to the shop floor the staff was absolutely rude and unprofessional. On one occasion the store manager yelled at me for no reason (just to make the other staff giggle) However when I stuck up for myself they all ganged up which made me feel really upset and down, the staff would then talk about me behind my back, and I just couldn\u2019t be bothered with this childish behaviour. ..I therefore handed my notice and quit the job ! DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT ! Don\u2019t even bother applying . 4.0 Visual Manager | White Rose, KY | Jan 12, 2020 Productive and fun workplace Great place to work, good progression opportunities and given me lots of technical and behavioural skills that can be adapted to any role. Good management team and store in general 5.0 Technical Advisor | Dumfries, VA | Dec 9, 2014 excelent team to work with Health & Safety, pre morning checks. Risk assessment of Contractors working in store, up grade any IT software to computers & point of sale kiosks. How to team build in an environment, Working as a team was most enjoyable, as we all knew our tasks. Trying to implement & promote company procedure's. Being left to implement shop floor projects & being able to bring together all trades and shop floor staff for a trouble free transition. ProsDiscount card Consshort breaks 3.0 Sales Assistant | Oxford, OH | Jun 5, 2013 Fun and interesting work place A typical day at work mainly consisted of making sales on the shop floor, as well as ordering and sending items, sorting out delivery and organising the stock room. 5.0 Sales Advisor | Oxford, OH | Aug 3, 2018 Great company to work for with a good team player environment I worked as a Sales Advisor and enjoyed going the extra mile to assist customers on my department and worked with some awesome co workers. Management was always around to talk to and were always approachable. ProsManagement, co workers, working environment 4.0 Service Advisor | White Rose, KY | Aug 1, 2013 Good place to work, nice members of staff, positive atmosphere A typical shift at Debenhams included working on the tills, usually for an hour or more, doing pot wash, working on beverages, and serving and waiting on tables, e.g. taking orders, registering orders, and taking food and drink out to the customers. I learned most of the skills necessary through various training days before the job commenced which I thought was very helpful. The management, specifically supervisors were always on hand to help if you had made a mistake and didn't know how to rectify it. All of the staff were friendly and polite and usually engaged in conversation which made the shift a lot more comfortable. The hardest part of the job was the initial training, i.e. the till system took a while for me to become comfortable with. I thought that the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with the customers and I thought that it was good that the rota meant that everybody got to do different things every shift, meaning that it didn't become boring and repetitive. ProsFriendly co workers. Positive atmosphere ConsNot the easiest place to get to from where i lived. 3.0 Jefe de ventas | White City, UT | Jun 8, 2020 Great teams All the team are fully engaged with company culture and standards. Great team work 5.0 Sales Assistant | Oracle, AZ | Jun 19, 2020 Overall Debenhams It has been a great company to work for but unfortunately it could not be saved I will always miss Debenhams and everything about it. Will miss not seeing Debenhams anymore in Oracle and being apart from its lovely staff as well. Questions And Answers about Debenhams What tips or advice would you give to someone interviewing at Debenhams? Asked Sep 24, 2019 Be confident- they favour the bold and people who will be chatty with the customers. Answered Oct 10, 2019 Be yourself amd unfortunatly you have to tell them what they want to hear, as staff opinion doesnt matter Answered Sep 24, 2019 What questions did they ask during your interview at Debenhams? Asked Oct 18, 2019 First of all they send an email/message to call them for a telephone interview which lasted around 20 minutes. The questions were asking about your legal documents and availability and then customer related questions such as: if you saw a customer how would you approach them? If you have passed the telephone interview they\u2019ll tell you straight away and then invite you to an interview in the store. The store interview lasted around 45 minutes and was a group interview and we had to fill out a form and then do a role play of picking an item from the shopfloor as a present and why we chose it. After that we worked on the shopfloor for around 20 minutes. You then get an email or call later that day or by next week saying you\u2019ve got the job.
