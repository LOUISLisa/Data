First of all, this whole company is a joke and a scam. I'm gonna lay everything out on the table to save you of such pain and misery. This company has the highest turnover rate, which is why they are always hiring. But they will make you believe that the reason behind that is from terminations. NO, that is not true. It is from people quitting this job because they find out how horrible it truly is. I first started working for GC last year in December and never would of thought I made it this far. In the matter of 8 months, I have watched the best and most outstanding employees, some of which worked there for 5+ or 10+ years, get fired for senseless reasons. The managers will get on your last nerve about getting payments and collecting money, but it is not for the well being of the company. They do that because they receive a monthly bonus that the employees aren't aware of. So as long as someone hits 20+ payments in a week and bonus's, they don't care what you do beyond that point. Also, this company has the worst organization when it comes to rules and company policies. Every 2 weeks they change the policy or the collection guidelines will change, and you are required to sign a form agreeing that you understand the stuff that has changed. So basically you are always having to adapt to new changes that are completely different that what you learned in training. And for most people they are used to the orig...more ProsFellow employees are very fun to be around, managers are cool, hour lunches, incentives ConsLiterally everything else 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Mesa, AZ | Mar 13, 2015 Not a good job for long term. I worked at GC Services as a Customer Rep for Apple. GC Services is a subcontractor for Apple. The Service they provide is horrible to the customer unless it's a \"quick fix\". You have to raise your hand if you need help with something you don't know anything about because the training you received was substandard. (Note: the trainer I had was wonderful.) But, we needed more real training instead of drawing pictures. The whole working in a group in training wasn't a good idea either. Working independently is a much better way to learn. Once your thrown out on the floor you get a couple of days of \"Y'ing\" in with someone else then your put on the phone to fend for yourself. There are lots of times that you put your hand up and there are NO floor walkers and no managers there to answer your questions so you have to ask coworkers. Your forced to come to work sick so yes everyone else gets sick as well and you just keep passing it around so the whole call center stays sick. And God forbid that you have to be out sick and miss days then that's an occurrence. EVEN with a doctors note it's an occurrence. And EVERYTHING is an occurrence!!!! Being a few seconds late is an occurrence, signing in early is an occurrence. They think the workforce is disposable. They would make more money if they focused on retention of their employees rather then \"it's ok if they leave we can always get someone else\". The pay stinks and they keep adding on more work for you to do. Things that other people ...more ProsPeople that I worked with. ConsThe whole work enviorment! Not having the training that you need to do your job and the pay stinks. 2.0 Outbound Call Center Representative | St. Louis, MO | Feb 25, 2015 Follow the script and collect the money The main idea was to follow the script to collect the money, an individual was scored on how well they read the script; word for word. There was a quota that needed to be met each month, if that quota was not met then a write up occurred, if the script was not followed word for word, then a write up occurred. When I entered the office each day, i would put away my lunch, then go to my desk. We are not allowed on the call center floor until five minutes before our shift. The first two hours of the work day was calling as many people as you could, leaving non foti messages on answering machines, calling family members to locate the customer, whatever it took for that customer to call back. Corporate credit cards are different from other credit cards, sometimes the corporation would stiff you with the balance after leaving the company, and there was no guarantee that they would pay the customer back the funds. Some corporations reimbursed the customers, but by the time we contacted them, some customers no longer had the funds to pay off the corporate cards. The next two hours were spent on skip tracing, trying to find the customers through the internet, or family; most skip trace tools gave phone numbers for all linked family members, even family members that the customer had no associations with anymore. Now it's lunch time, for a full hour; it was the best time of the day, not to be on the phones. After lunch; more skip tracing, internet searches for people that really ...more 4.0 Unit Manager | Mesa, AZ | Jul 8, 2012 A good start to my career Unit Manager-Sprint Customer Finance \u2022 Responsible for coaching and developing team members related to performance and conduct. \u2022 Responsible for discipline of employees in the unit including proper documentation and application of standard operating procedures and product specific procedures. \u2022 Responsible for motivating employees within the unit, including the administration of monthly and special contests. \u2022 Completed 100 monitor reviews monthly and monthly planning guides for all personnel. \u2022 Assisted training department with the development and on-going training of all employees in the unit. \u2022 Responsible for tracking unit attendance and payroll as well as assisting employees with vacation requests. âª Monitored switch interface software in an effort to achieve daily requirements for each products service level agreements âª Created and maintained data/charts for intra-day reporting needs. âª Created and maintained data/charts for supporting staffing requirements âª Created and Maintained data/charts that track/trend product absenteeism and full time equivalents âª Maintained and analyzed phone volume data âª Maintained and operated outbound dialer campaign systems âª Communicated staffing requirements to upper management with supporting data âª Often responsible for producing and disseminating ad hoc reporting âª Produced, assigned, and adjusted schedules to provide adequate coverage for phone volume âª Provided support personnel with needed reports, schedules, etc., that are h...more 3.0 Payroll Clerk | Knoxville, TN | Jul 10, 2013 Unethical, hostile work environment with lots of unprofessionalism. Each day on the job I serve as a liaison between my employer & their clients in regards to wage garnishments on defaulted student loans. I contact the payroll processors with various companies to inquire as to whether their company has received our garnishment order regarding employees, frequency of pay for making garnishment deductions, follow up on status of orders & status of payments. I obtain information on orders that have been released & garnishments stopped in order to make sure further deductions from employee wages aren't continued. I'm responsible for making sure correspondence gets faxed or mailed, making copies, and just making sure things are handled in a timely manner. I have learned the process regarding defaulted student loans, how to manage time wisely, how to operate different machinery such as copiers & fax machines, handling of incoming and outgoing calls & also how to maintain professionalism when in contact with people from diverse backgrounds. I feel as if the management team is unprofessional as well as unethical at times and is in need of great improvement. However, my co-workers are wonderful and we all come together as a team to actually make sure that the procedures of the department are handled appropriately and that we do our best to keep our company in the competitive field. In my opinion the hardest part of the job is staying positive, focused, & motivated throughout the unfair treatment & unprofessional tactics from within management. On...more 1.0 Solution Specialist | El Paso, TX | May 29, 2019 Definitely not the best place to work in EP I've been with the company for a year and a half. The pay is absolutely awful for the demands they place on you. I work with the Verizon project, and I've only ever bonused once in the entire time I've been here. Bonuses are contingent on the center reaching a 60% NPS (net promoter score) and your metrics as a whole. Our center doesn't bonus because our liaison is so finicky about what she expects, she will deny the removal of bad surveys because you used a word she didn't approve of. Their scoring system is ming boggling. If a customer rates Verizon 9 or 10, we get a score of 100. (Because we call center reps should be held liable if Verizon is terrible to its customers.) If the customer rates Verizon 7 or 8, we get a score of 0. If the customer rates Verizon 6 or below, our score is dropped to -100. They've recently implemented a \"no phones\" policy because someone stole $70,000 worth of equipment on people's accounts using their credit card info and refuse to give us any alternatives to storing our phones, so we either have to leave them in our cars (which they claim they're not responsible for if that results in theft or damage) or leave them at home. Their \"emergency line\" doesn't have a voicemail box to leave messages on in the event someone needs to get in touch. Everything is \"do it, or we write you up\" and the attitudes towards agents are incredibly aggressive. They've taken away boosts in morale such as the Memorial Day picnic and treats when we do well.

It is hands down the worst job I have ever had in my life! And I stayed 5yrs.! All call centers are fast paced, that is expected, but that place is off the chain! The training was minimal to say the least, just the basics as far as a script and rebuttals, they flew thru the screen training and threw us on the phones. The class started with 25 the first day, down to 13 the second, and there were only 6 of us that made it to the floor on the phones, and only 2 a month later. The calls were so fast you could barely catch your breath before the next one. If we needed help, raise your hand and someone would eventually get to you, while either the customer was on hold or you figured it out. The managers were running around yelling to \"wrap it up\" and \"watch your time\". It was so loud that the customers often asked if we were having a party! The whole time you are chained by the head to a never ending supply of upset, very rude and screaming customers! Management made it worse. On top of their yelling across the floor, they would constantly monitor your calls and would write you up for the slightest things. The ones that actually tried to help you didn't last long, the place is in constant turmoil. Some of the employees were friendly, most however had substace abuse issues, when on the job, and some managers did too. Plus it's a very dirty old building that has had several insect issues. It was very stressful to say the least. It wasn't long before I started having anxiety iss...more ProsBetter pay than my couch ConsEverything about it 3.0 Account Representative | Copperas Cove, TX | Mar 10, 2019 If you like paid vacation/sick time don't work here. I am a current employee, coming up on my 3yr anniversary 032519. I started at $8/hr. Right now I make $8.82/hr. In the middle of 2017 they implemented a new pay rate of $10/hr. But if you accepted the new payscale you lost your bonus(based on stats each week), you lost your paid vacation and you lost your paid sick time. Those of us that were there before the change were given the option to stay on the old payscale(keeping bonus & paid vaca/sick time). Now if your newly hired you automatically start at $10/hr and you do accumulate ppt(sick)/vacation but it's all unpaid. They're starting to do irregular schedules with 9-10hr days with 2-15min breaks and a half hour lunch. If you work inbound, because the dialer tech has to screenshot every hour, you have to wait until they tell you to go to your breaks and lunch. And if you have to go to the bathroom when it's not your break or lunch, you have to deduct that time from your breaks, making your breaks shorter than 15min, to keep your dialer utilization down. It's a repitious job where you get screamed/cursed at by \"think they know it all\" customers. You have managers consistently yelling at you while you're on calls about getting out of wrap(outbound) and moving your calls and getting out of after call(inbound) and having customers complain because they can't hear you or having to apologize to the customer and ask them to repeat what they said because you couldn't hear them. Then they preach about watching what you say on the ph...more ProsNone ConsEverything listed above. 2.0 Agent | Lakeland, FL | Mar 1, 2015 Very unreliable for a communicative and enjoyable atmosphere at work. A typical day at work consisted of taking phone calls from Verizon Wireless representatives regarding their customer's credit. Training was very poor because we would be thrown onto the phones and be told to raise our hands when we had a question with no experience. I would also approve and deny applications for credit manually when not taking phone calls. I learned people can be very difficult to deal with, such as being blamed for bad credit that isn't your fault. The management at GC was fine, it's just they had to listen to orders given to them from Verizon. GC Services is employed by Verizon. Verizon has ultimate authority and gave orders but never responded when asked why orders had to be given a certain way, such as why I was never permitted to take phone calls ever again after being business trained. Verizon replied business applications were the priority but would never tell me when I could take phone calls again. My co-workers shared the same frustrations I did with the company and the overall morale was low because we felt we were never given answers when we had legit concerns. The hardest part of the job was sitting in a chair for 8 hours straight, and once we became business trained we were only allowed to do business applications. This being said on days such as Sunday when most businesses are closed and we weren't allowed to take phone calls we had absolutely no work whatsoever to do. The most enjoyable part of the job, being there was very little I ...more ProsGuaranteed 40 hours of pay a week ConsPoor pay, angry customers and no explanation as to why rules were set how they were by Verizon 5.0 Executive Secretary | Holbrook, NY | Oct 25, 2012 Retail Project Mgmt of NY; Holbrook - best boss ever but office too small A typical day at work revolved around taking care of the needs of everyone, from the owner/president, staff & co-workers, all clients, contractors; meet, greet and screen all visitors and handle multi-line phone system. Daily crisis management while remaining cool under pressure + being able to multi-task with constant interruptions was also part of the job. The best part of the job was completing projects and submitting bids on time and in excellent detail; when everything was in sync between clients, subcontractors and me holding up the admnistrative end, we were awarded many large commercial build jobs. In addition to the satisfaction of taking part in bidding jobs, the most rewarding part of my position honestly was the customer service aspect. Whatever I could do to take care of someone's needs made me happier than anything else. I enjoy a job where you are expected to be a team player and jump in at anytime to help w/ multiple assignments. My co-workers were amazing, especially so many of the clients & contractors I got to know so well over the phone. I'd have to say the hardest part of the job at times was the pressure of completing a project bid while still addressing small, less important requests with a smile. Occasionally, it was hard to prioritize a \"to do\" list when everything on it was considered urgent. What I learned from that is to trust my decisions, not micro-manage myself so much and recognize when I've done all I can do & it's time to let go and move on. ...more Prosbuilding strong customer relationships and co-worker friendships Consthe front office was freezing in the winter and sweltering in the summer, not enough bathrooms, short lunch break.

Asked Feb 25, 2016 You are lied to, judged by age (I am over 50) and was made to feel worthless, and kept in the dark for a good week while they \"decide \". Management acts like it's a chore to interview you. College level math and English and very extensive personality tests, which don't really seem to go with the job. I have a feeling even if I was hi it red O would be unhappy because the management seem very rude and lazy. Answered Mar 16, 2019 I first received a call from the recruiter, who found my resume on Indeed. She told me all about the position and asked if I was interested in coming in for an interview with the department manager.
