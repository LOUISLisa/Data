We believe the world would be a better place if every voter cast an informed vote in every election in which he or she is eligible to vote. We work to present the available information about elections, candidates, judges, ballot measures, and more in a way that enables our readers to vote with confidence and to act as engaged citizens outside of the polling booth. Ballotpedia readers, like Ballotpedia staff, are special people. And in 2016, we got curious enough about what made our readers special to commission an in-depth study to answer that question. Here\u2019s an excerpt from the conclusion: Readers are characterized by their decision to run toward knowledge, instead of retreating. This sense of \u201conward\u201d characterizes the Ballotpedia readers\u2014they recognized a problem with the media they had been consuming and sought out a different way.

Mostly, they came from Google. Google has always loved our detailed, well-sourced articles because their algorithm is excellent at figuring out what their searchers are after. That search engine dominance got us past one BILLION lifetime pageviews in September 2018, and helped make us the 92nd most-visited website in the U.S. during the month surrounding the November 2018 midterms. We scarcely had an email list before 2016. We now have over 250,000 subscribers on more than a dozen separate lists. We are working in numerous ways to help put our neutral information in front of people at the times when they most need it. We firmly believe that our readers, and the mindset we help them cultivate, are essential, as too many others in our industry are fighting to get us all addicted to sensational clickbait headlines and the irrational decisions they foster. And, with all that, we\u2019re just getting started, knowing that the opportunities and growth ahead are limitless. If this is a mission you\u2019d be willing to work hard to achieve, and if this is a team you\u2019d be willing to work hard with, join us.
