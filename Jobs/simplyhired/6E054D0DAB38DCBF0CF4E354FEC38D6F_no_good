Perfect job for me ... All the different challenges appear which makes the job very interesting and the hours go by quickly. Pleasant and enjoyable workday. ProsPleasant enviroment most of the time. ConsSometimes have no time for breaks or lunch. 5.0 Customer Service Representative | Los Angeles, CA | Feb 2, 2018 Fun place to work It is always fun and exciting to work in an airline industry. You get to meet a lot of different people everyday. Everyday is a challenging day so it never gets boring. ProsWorkmates are fun to work with ConsBenefits, split schedule that can compromise your health 5.0 Account Analyst | Manila, AR | May 23, 2016 love the benefits i specifically love the flying benefits where you have free flights not just for the employee but also for the dependents. 4.0 Operations Supervisor | Manila, AR | Apr 21, 2012 Getting your work done in eight hours should be the case but not the kind of work that I do. Being in-charge of budgets and flight crew planning makes you aware about how much certain operations gets to cost the company. Knowing that, we make plans that are cost effective and are within rules and regulations operationally. In that way we contribute to maximize profitability. Motivating people and to ensure that their needs are met and the company's, as well. Meeting budget deadlines is a challenge that I normally take. 5.0 Customer Service Representative | Honolulu, HI | May 30, 2016 Great work place. Staff of Philippine Airlines are the best. No drama. Great people. Enjoyed working with traveling public and travel agents.The Philippine Culture is very family oriented. While the flight benefits are not that great working there made it a great place to work, ProsStaff, benefits, health care, pension ConsFlight Benefits not that great 2.0 Equipment Operator | United States | Feb 8, 2013 The company had always been having a problem, huge losses, fuel, employee and labor problems. You report for work early at 4:30 am and seat at the check-in-counter and serve passengers. Process check-in and give boarding passes and tag their baggages until their last destination to Manila and other international flights say Asia, Europe and USA. There are calm, stubborn, irritable passengers you name it. Its part of your job to be scolded, insulted and at times praised! Unlike ramp jobs say equipment operators and loaders there is no contact with passengers. All work is concentrated on the baggages, equipment and aircraft concerned. The hardest part of the job is when a 747jumbo jet is cancelled!. You have to serve and assist 450 passengers, their bookings, flight re scheduling, meal and transport allowances and hotel accomodations and arrangements with all the insult and scolding. AT times you only have 1 hr of sleep then go back again to work. I learned that management made a very big mistake when it did not take seriously the new incoming competitor a few years ago. The new competitor gave very low promo fares, a strategy that made them number one right now. (Cebu Pacific) The most enjoyable part of the job is when management and employees are united say after labor disputes and bargainings are implemented. An employees morale is high when he has an increase in his take home pay. ... 5.0 Equipment Technician | United States | Nov 24, 2012 productive and profitable company/ I leaned so much and more experience as a ground support equipment technician of the airline company.... Proswith lunch break Conswith health care and hospitalization 5.0 Customer Service Representative | San Francisco, CA | Jul 3, 2020 Still the best job I ever did! Travel benefits are the best!Pay is not that great thinking it pose as a great hazard of exposure to international germs and viruses. Being in first line of Immigration defense is fulfilling. ProsTravel ConsLimited vacations 5.0 Customer Service Representative | Los Angeles, CA | Feb 6, 2018 Fun place to help and assist my fellow Filipinos. Proud to be able to represent Filipinos that works here in the US and be able to help and assist all the passengers with their flights incoming or outbound to the Philippines whether for business or travel purposes. 3.0 Sales Associate | National, WV | Feb 5, 2018 Departments are being outsourced Philippine Airlines is a reputable company however currently, departments are being outsourced and benefits that come along with the job are therefore not given to said employees. A lot of politics within the management and it is difficult to advance unless you know someone who can put in a good word for you.
