Every day I work with companies using Salesforce to transform the way they do business. As the company expands, my opportunities do as well. Since working at Salesforce I have gained new skills that opened up new doors should I ever leave. There are also growing opportunities internally. Along with promotions, I have also been encouraged to move laterally at times to gain new experience. Along with career growth, I also appreciate the way Salesforce treats employees. My salary has always felt competitive with the industry average. The employee stock program has been a great way to create a stronger financial foundation. I have also been allowed to change my work location when needed, including opportunities to work remote. Remote work is dependent on the role. The downside to hyper growth has been the disruption internally. I don't mind change, but sometimes change happens without understanding the downstream impacts. I have seen executives overlook two separate organizations creating duplicate products and processes. I have also seen the opposite, when an executive team combined multiple groups without realizing what would be lost. In one example, a group was disassembled, only to be reassembled from the ground up later by a different team. Not only was it inefficient, it also brought resentment from the people who were initially required to move. Another concerning tre...more 5.0 Technical Program Manager | Herndon, VA | Aug 14, 2019 You want fast? This place goes fast. It's \"fun chaos\" at an Enterprise with the soul of a Startup. Priorities change fast here. Your first 3 months will be trying to make sense of it and feeling frustrated, until it eventually clicks that \"the rules are made up and the points don't matter\" (like Whose Line). Salesforce is approaching 40,000 employees but in many ways has retained that \"start-uppy\" feel of pivoting on a dime to build and release products sourced right from customer needs. It gives you whiplash early on, and everyone is constantly asked to do 200% of whatever they could possibly do (which is why the \"80-20 rule\" matters so much for work-life balance and mental health here). Eventually you learn to kind of shrug, say \"Whee!\", and go with it. Then it's fun! Learn to prioritize and advocate! Don't say \"Yes\" to everything, because the job will take everything from you it can if you let it, when we're going this fast. One of the coolest things about working here (a bug or a feature depending on you), is how openly the company wears its socially progressive stance on its sleeve. Philanthropy and pursuit of equality permeates the entire place's DNA, which infuses a sense of \"purpose\" into what could otherwise be cold or boring enterprise cloud software. Other recruiters have attempted to poach me multiple times and often told me how \"impossible\" it is to get people to leave Salesforce. The high compensation and sense of purpose is a huge part of why. Go to Dreamforce and see for yourself! Customers are RABID for this platform, they love it. It feels ...more 5.0 Manager | Indianapolis, IN | Aug 27, 2019 The Rumors Are True I've worked at Salesforce for over 5 years now and all those things you hear are true. I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop but it just never does. I enjoy my daily responsibilities (checking in with the team, collaborating with internal and external customers, bettering myself with available development trainings), my team, going to work in the morning, my leaders, my direct and indirect peers, the perks, the technology, the workspaces, the investment in learning and growing and that I have flexibility. The best part of the job is that as a result, I've become a better human being. It sounds crazy and cheesy and drank-the-koolaid-ish, but I truly am able to be a better parent, member of my family and of the community. That kind of knowledge and engagement is contagious and Salesforce's investment in its employee's well-being by default extends to those around them. My friends and family volunteer more, listen and learn about our community with what I take back to them (i.e. one of our employee groups hosts local expert guests to cover topics like homelessness in our city, eduction, food deserts, climate change, etc.) and engage on a different level in their communities. The hardest part of the job is related to change management. It can be really rough. In the end it always works out and does in fact prevent any kind of boredom, but it's tough getting there sometimes. I've never considered leaving Salesforce through even the toughest days. ProsBright colleagues open to giving and receiving feedback, amazing unique perks, cool locations, fun opportunities. ConsChange management, remote leaders/direct reports, limited to no travel depending on role 5.0 Contributor | Bellevue, WA | Apr 9, 2018 Up and coming in Bellevue Beautiful downtown Bellevue office. Salesforce touts itself as one of the best companies to work for, there are many employee perks. Fitness monthly benefit, good health insurance, most teams have bonuses (but watch out, sometimes its incredibly hard to meet your bonus), gym in building, free company swag, reimbursements for things like BOSE headphones, etc. Teams are a bit disconnected, largely because there are a large amount of remote workers across the country. Hardest part of the job was having a new manager every 2-4 months and never meeting that manager in person. Expect to use online chat a lot (google hangouts) and almost never log off. There are many extra bureaucratic hoops you will be expected to jump through, many online trainings to complete. There is a lot of red tape and bs. The culture is the hawaiian \"ohana\" which means family, but it can be a little much. Look up Ohana Salesforce songs on Youtube to understand. The cons are that there are limited career progression options, especially in the Bellevue Hub. There is a lot of \"throwing people under the bus\". Hard to trust people, even though Salesforce says their #1 value is trust. Pros\"#1 workplace\" according to Forbes, Zen Bellevue office, free snacks, many employee perks ConsManagement, competitive culture, make yourself look good by making others look bad 2.0 Project Manager | New York, NY | Aug 19, 2019 Growing Tech Company Becoming More Political And Less Fun Salesforce is changing. Some things for the good like the amazing office spaces, especially in hub cities where there is a \"Tower\" building. The views, environment, as well as amenities on those top floors and throughout the building is very good by any standard. Cleary revenue is growing, and lots of new acquisitions expanding the footprint, making the company seem like an innovator. However Salesforce is also incorporating all the worst things about a big company. Everyone is becoming selfish, promoting their own things, undermining other people's initiatives, promoting employees they like or who have worked with them before as opposed to anything resembling merit, and layers and layers of bureaucracy to get anything done. The worst manifestation of it is the 3-tier system of employees at the company. Small group of favorites (10%), 40% larger group of general employees who are no different in quality or ambition than any other company, and 40% of people who are actively pushed down. The remaining 10% are brand new so not yet in group or another. In summary if you like big companies with some perks, work at Salesforce. If you actually believe most of what Salesforce says matter, go elsewhere as things are only getting worse. 5.0 Senior Product Specialist | San Francisco, CA | Dec 16, 2013 Great Place to Work Salesforce is a great place to work. They truly value their employees and continuously work to make it a more enjoyable work place. There are a lot of perks such as fitness reimbursement, commuter discounts, company iPhone, laptop and iPad,volunteer time off, floating holidays, etc. A typical day at work for me involves meetings with various teams. It all depends on the project I'm working on at the time. Overall, I'd say its a very collaborative culture here. Obviously at Salesforce, I've learned to use the app quite well. I've also broadened my knowledge of technology and learned about trends in the industry. My co-workers are great. It's a very casual culture here. Everyone asks how your weekend was, happy hours occur regularly, team dinners about once or twice a quarter. Overall everyone is pretty pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job is probably the typical struggles that go with working for a large company. Things need to move quickly, but obstacles can make that difficult. My department is relatively new though, so I'm sure the kinks will get worked out as we work together longer. ProsCorporate phone, laptop and tablet, volunteer time off, fitness reimbursement, great healthcare ConsDifficult to move around if you are a junior role 2.0 Senior Manager | San Francisco, CA | Feb 19, 2020 Dysfunctional Organizations, Hostile work environment, poor management and no support from HR/ES This is the most dysfunctional environment that I have ever experienced. The organization has terrible leadership who care more about self preservation and growing their kingdom than doing what is right for the business and employees. There are no clear decision makers and the org operates more like a dictatorship than anything else. Rude and bully-like behavior is tolerated and management works to sweep things under the rug for fear of exposure to ES/HR. Speaking of ES/HR, they do not support employees and seem more like a gatekeeper and protector of management vs really helping to aid in the success of the employee. If you go to ES/HR, they will let your mgt know at which retaliation takes place. Incompetent, arrogant and unprofessional managers are rampant and there are zero consequences for poor behavior. Professional maturity is nonexistent. How this company keeps winning Fortune Top Corp is beyond me! Maybe there are pockets of the company that have good teams but there are many areas that mirror what I have experienced. 5.0 Operations Analyst | San Francisco, CA | Aug 19, 2014 Great working environment, supportive department, and hard working. Worked Monday through Friday 40+ hours a week training new / former hires, creating 10+ excel spreadsheets daily, set up meeting with teams, receive and review 100+ emails daily with international requesters. Also manually entering raw data into two Salesforce platforms (Budgetingforce and Coupa) to manage EMEA, APAC and Japan purchase request / purchase orders and/or budget spend for the four quarters. I've learned about paying attention to detail (emails, data entry, and reports), understanding the meaning of a task or project, being a clear communicator (verbal / written), prioritizing work / time management and stay motivated. The Marketing Operations team was a great support in my success. Answered all of my questions, provided me feedback weekly, so I can improve on my weaknesses, allowed me to have a voice and freedom to manage a project. The most enjoyable part of my job that I was able to connect with different departments and people through my time at Salesforce. It helped me view ideas, opinions and decisions differently. 5.0 Customer Success Manager | London, OH | Aug 14, 2019 Fabulous Working Environment work with cool Innovative Technology Salesforce is an amazing company to work for. The culture is fantastic complimented by amazing offices (desks, kitchens, chill out zones etc.) at Salesforce Tower London. Collaboration across management layers and departments is extremely transparent which means your productivity is high. There is a common goal to breakdown barriers and overcome any hurdles. The product is cutting edge in terms of what it offers as a Customer Experience Platform from Sales through to Service, Marketing, Commerce etc. so your work/meetings/conversations with customers, friends and colleagues are always relevant and interesting. With the Product often being business critical to our customers, meeting their expectations is always a challenge so prepare to push yourself and explore. Giving back is a huge part of the Salesforce mantra and I've managed to setup a Community Football Academy for boys and girls in my local area who have not had the opportunity to participate. This is a proud achievement and hopefully a legacy I'll leave behind. 5.0 Information Technology Intern | San Francisco, CA | May 20, 2020 Educational and Amazing During my internshi in highschool, I left for work around 3 and then go to work, start on a new project. I would help people from my team or different people around Salesforce. A typical work day would be coming in at 8am, catching up on work, and then when everyone else comes in,and they give me new assignments. I learned about manual regression, UI interface, and webpages. The management was amazing. They met my needs exceptionally. By far, I was the youngest worker there. They helped my transition from high school to college The workplace culture was really outstanding. Everyone had so much advice to offer and give me. I felt so included. The hardest part of my job was the long hours that summer I finished high school. I helped work on the biggest project. Sometimes, I had a hard time understanding the code and other aspects but when I got the hang of it, everything was fine. The most enjoyable part of the job was to have lunch with my co-workers. It was so cool just to sit and hear what everyone was working on and what they had going on. They were a family and they welcomed me with open arms.
