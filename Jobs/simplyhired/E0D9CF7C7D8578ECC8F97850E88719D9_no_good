Lots of shifts available. Lines could be more varied and it would be nice to have more flexibility with swapping shifts and having vacation approved. 4.0 Administrative Assistant | Edmonton, KY | Dec 7, 2011 Good place to work. I worked in Alberta Health Services for approximately a total of 14 years starting with the Peace Health Region, then Captial Health Region, Alberta Cancer Board and Public Health. 4.0 Senior Administrative Assistant | Campus, IL | Jan 17, 2018 Grow. Its an amazing place to work at if you are not a leader. If you are someone that is a leader, creative and want to always grow in life it isn't the place for you. There are too many policies and procedures in place that wont allow you to grow or learn new things without making mistakes. 5.0 Community Service Officer | Lead, SD | Apr 4, 2014 Great place to work and loved the experience Was a very good place to work and was very challenging. It was a great experience. Prosveriaty of jobs 4.0 Nursing Assistant | California City, CA | Aug 20, 2018 I passed bachelor in nursing I passed bachelor in nursing with more than 4 years of work experience.i want to do work in your hospital.i will try to give best performance In your hospital ProsFree health check up ConsShort vaccation 4.0 Scheduler | Sheldon, IA | Jan 24, 2018 Productive Productive, fun and fast-paced environment There is good work-life balance at AHS and this enables you to work without feeling the pressure that comes with the position you accupy 3.0 Medical Transcriptionist | Health, AR | May 19, 2015 High-strung atmosphere, terrible management, bad for your body The day in the life of a medical transcriptionist is not one that I would recommend. Of course working in an office always has it's pros and cons, the negative effects of sitting in a chair, typing all day are ubiquitous and you can't get away from them, even if you work at home. Working from home would be better for doing stretches and getting up and walking around and going for a tea or coffee every now wand then, resetting your eyes and things like that. At AHS, I mostly enjoyed the casual MT position, as it allowed me to work only when I wanted to because there were enough shifts to work full-time hours. I learned that sitting behind a desk and typing all day wreaks havoc on your body. Your cardiovascular system suffers, you potentially get carpal tunnel, your joints and ligaments all stiffen and tighten up, your eyesight gets worse from staring at a screen all day. Your back muscles become knotted and tight, adversely affecting your posture and the overall structure of your body. You get fatigued from not moving all day. Co-workers were mostly middle-aged or older women who did not exercise and only gossiped about other people. The most enjoyable part of my job was coming in and not having to prepare anything, if I didn't want to get involved in the drama I would just continue working away, earphones droning out the judgemental comments, and then when I had put in my 8 hours I could just shut down my computer and leave. No preparing anything. No real ti...more ProsYou come in, you do your work, you leave. ConsHad to pay for parking, sat in a chair all day, terrible management. 4.0 Counselor | Chapel Hill, NC | Aug 14, 2013 i enjoyed the staff great staff and great place to work @. i wish i could have kept that position, but the hours became short once the state took over the facility 2.0 Kitchen Team Member | Valleyview, OH | Sep 26, 2018 Enjoy working with the co workers whom have been there the longest I apprenticed the knowledge and training I received from certain coworkers. I enjoyed working with others and having a great work atmosphere. I enjoyed the fast pace work. I very much liked being able to have contact with the general public and still maintain proper work ethic 5.0 Food Service Worker | Alberta, VA | Nov 7, 2017 Loved Working Here This was the best job I have had yet. It was a very hard one to leave. They pay well, and treat their employees great. I loved my supervisor at my facility. She listened to my needs, as well as help me improve my performance. Again, I loved it there, and was very sad to have to go! Questions And Answers about Alberta Health Services What benefits does Alberta Health Services offer?
