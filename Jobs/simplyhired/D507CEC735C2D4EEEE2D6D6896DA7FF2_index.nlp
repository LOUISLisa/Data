Overall Reviews at American Express 3.0 Software Engineer | New York, NY | Oct 4, 2018 \u201cWhat doesn't kill you makes you stronger\u201d Good - Nice View Outside: Hudson River, Statue of Liberty, New Jersey, Upper Manhattan, Lower Manhattan & One World Trade Center - Humble Manager: My manager works hard and over time. Sometimes provides feedbacks with the double-layer sandwich method. Supportive and helped develop my confidence and leadership style by guiding through the process and by allowing/pushing to make my own decisions. - Team leads: Inspiring, humble, supportive encouraging. Celebrated the differences. - Co-workers: Funny, supportive, helpful, Inspiring, and creative. I gained more confidence, became a better individual as a person and as a programmer. Bad - No Guide(s) for new hires: So much confusion, disorientation, and brusque orders without any great explanation. - Bureaucracy at its best: Vague and empty official feedbacks & criticism on performance from completely different department\u2019s managers and teams. - No Transparency: Possibility of getting fired (happened) when talking with someone above your manager like team director, even if he adds his own & collects all the comments & feedbacks about ones\u2019 performance from different unrelated & unconnected departments. - Judgments through Assumptions: Negative feedbacks on my performance by other department\u2019s managers across the floor by their great observation skills. - Miscommunication & Misunderstanding: Between team members and across other teams, managers and team director. And no efforts for further clarification and for...more 1.0 Travel Counselor | Remote | Sep 19, 2018 This is the WORST job I have ever had in my life While working at American Express I was constantly worried that I was going to be fired, until I ultimately was. The metrics they expect you to receive for their survey scores are unrealistic, which they know, but they don't care. -You're expected to receive 7 positive surveys to outweigh 1 negative survey. Never mind that almost every negative survey you receive will be no fault of your own (incorrect card terms, another agent error, wrong department.) So, let's say you receive two negative surveys in one month (30 days, that's doable, right?) You need to get FOURTEEN positive surveys to meet your metrics for that month. And that is just ONE metric. Never mind that the average agent only pulls in 5-10 surveys a month, maximum. You may be thinking this is doable...it's not. Want to know why? Because you can have a fantastic call with a card member and still get a \"5/10\" survey score, or heck \"8/10\" (yup that still counts against you) because of something stupid like the card member doesn't get free breakfast at their hotel. How do you have control over that? -MICROMANAGEMENT. You spend more than 9 minutes in after call a manager reaches out and asks why...but you need help because you can't figure something out and contact a manager....I once waited 1 hour and 37 minutes for a manager to contact me back. THAT'S American Express. -You inquire about the metrics they will always find something you could've done on that call. Regardless of if the card member says \"you have...more Prospay Consmicromanagement, managers, lack of support, poor benefits, bad leadership, impossible metrics 2.0 Customer Service Representative | North Carolina | Jan 4, 2019 Constantly stress, underpaid & under appreciated I\u2019ve worked at Amex long enough to be considered tenured. There was to be a time when that mattered. No more. Tenured agents have to work major holidays unless they are top sellers then the chances of them getting off work on holidays is higher. How you treat your employees, regardless of time on the job, says a lot about the company. And it\u2019s not good. It\u2019s all about the numbers. Every number. Every metric possible. It\u2019s too much. Not only are we required to know our jobs, but sometimes procedures for other departments like card replacement and fraud. And at times, are expected to act like managers to reduce escalated calls. They push sales more than they worry about the errors the agents make on calls. Constant emails are sent providing more ways to sell, trainings are scheduled throughout the year to make sure you are comfortable with selling, huddles and team meetings mainly focus on selling etc etc A great deal of our metrics, and salary increases, come from the surveys customers fill out. If the customer is happy with the agent but rates the entire entity of Amex as poor, the agent still has to take those survey results. Management never backs out surveys meant for someone else or about the company as a whole. It\u2019s ridiculous. Upper management often make poor decisions for the agents who take calls. They change procedures to save money but make more work for those of us who have to take those call types. I used to be proud to work at Amex but things have defin...more ProsBenefits, ability to work from home ConsUnrealistic goals, low pay for what is expected, sales environment, not respected or appreciated by upper management 3.0 Travel Counselor | Remote | Sep 29, 2019 Overwhelming For Those With No Prior Travel Experience I was hired into the Platinum Travel Counselor role, and had previous experience in finance related roles, though travel experience was not required nor did I have any. For the amount of training you do (which is quite extensive) having to learn all current bank holding regulatory laws and company privacy practices and then adding on the additional training for travel agents and the industry's regulations, requirements etc is so much to learn. Even with 12 weeks or so of training it didn't feel like enough (and that was the general consensus of those in my training group that actually HAD prior travel industry experience, I was the only one new to the travel industry entirely) - we were flying blind on calls booking travel that could easily run $20K on a normal call with Platinum Card Members - the company specific Sabre based GDS software (Encore) was constantly buggy and laggy which made finding and booking flights where prices change by the click an absolute nightmare. The deal breaker for me was when the position went from having no sales quota requirements when I accepted the position ... to becoming sales based as part of the performance metric to not only earn incentive but to even be meeting expectations that were not initially part of the job just months prior. Throwing someone with no travel into the travel industry is one thing - but when you advertise a position as non-sales based and then change your position requirements months later and base their pay and perfo...more 3.0 Travel Counselor | Phoenix, AZ | Oct 6, 2019 I wasn't looking for a sales position I stuck this job out for as long as I could. I'd done corporate travel for 10+ years, but being a part of the Platinum Card Travel Services team was less than ideal. I was given a late shift that left me struggling with to find my footing. I was told that I had to take no more than 20mins per call. The more complex the request was, the longer it took to book the travel. It didn't help that during my own shift from the time I started my shift at 3pm until 10pm, there were always to many agents. I would sit for hours waiting for a call, if it wasn't new travel I was sewing up the transaction for another agent. The company offers sick time and paid time off. If you ran out of the sick time, you couldn't use the paid time off to compensate for the difference. I have accrued PTO, and am short for the pay period. You can't take advantage of vacation opportunities until the metric show a certain level. I'm old school customer service, I want to take care of the issue. I was expected to 'move on' to the next person calling in. American Express is a bank, but that set of parameters doesn't work for the travel side of the house. I've enjoyed the people I've gotten to know. BUT, I am not a sales person. I know people who have worked for American Express for decades. I had bid for the vacation blocks submitted during the first part of the open bid. Those with seniority or the best metrics, got the times they wanted. This job was not my cup of tea. I'm preparing to look for another...more 3.0 Contract IT | Arizona | Jul 25, 2019 Not a fun place to contract I worked at American Express Technologies as a direct employee (or \"Colleague\") for several years, left and then returned several years later as a contractor. By implication, a contractor is not considered of \"Colleague\" status. If you contract at American Express, you are a second-class citizen. Get used to it. The working atmosphere is interesting. The ethnic mix is around 80% Indian, many, if not most, on H1B visas. Walking through the Desert Ridge or TRCN/TRCW offices, you could be in Hyderabad. One advantage is the office potlucks and lunchtimes will expose you to an interesting international food mix, which can be fun. The office environment is horrible. They have implemented \"Blue Work\" in many offices meaning you don't get even get a cube. The office areas consist of open bays the size of a football field. Everyone sits at long tables outfitted with monitors, keyboards and mice, and a phone. You bring your laptop in and plug it into the monitor and do your thing. You clear your area of the table when you leave at night. The \"open and collaborative\" environment means constant interruption. Teams are not supposed to hold meetings and conference calls in the open areas, but since huddle rooms are constantly occupied, it happens. But the good news is that Amex saves a ton of money on real estate and office equipment. Apparently the accountants have not found a way to quantify the cost of lost productivity. Many people love working for American...more 1.0 Consultant | Georgia | May 28, 2019 American Express Culture I\u2019d worked for American Express as part of their Work at home program. They dazzle you with how great the job is but once you start training, it\u2019s clear that the management does not support the colleagues. The management is rarely available to help but come down on your when they believed you didn\u2019t handle something right. They give you lots of PTO yet actually getting it approved is nearly impossible. In fact, there\u2019s a NO PTO allowed scenario happening now until the Fall. They encourage a very competitive environment and in fact they teach us to upsell products versus being honest about what their options are. To me, it\u2019s a culture of dishonesty, lack of colleague appreciation, metrics that NOBODY can meet, programs that nobody can get to because the expectations are unattainable, and the management just doesn\u2019t care. They all have egos the size of Europe! You\u2019re to \u201c do your job as they see it\u201d yet what they want is never clearly defined! Telling someone they\u2019re wrong constantly is a HARD place to be. I\u2019m considering leaving because I\u2019m so stressed out, no job security, can\u2019t use my benefits , and just a sense that you\u2019re alone on an island with no hopes. No job should be this stressful! They pay well but should have counselors online because everyone I know at AMEX is to the point of having a nervous breakdown and the few who are happy are \u201cdrinking the koolaid.\u201d There is NO life balance due to schedules and NO help. ProsThe pay is good ConsUnrealistic metrics, can\u2019t use PTO, no life/ work balance, ridiculous schedules, upselling clients which equates to lying and no work security 3.0 Travel Consultant | Remote | Feb 1, 2019 Positive uplifting promises with NO reality of them happening Metrics are largely unattainable. On a scale of 0-10- anything below a 9 is a detractor and takes away from your numbers. Those numbers are what your shift bids, vacation day requests and overall performance are measured by. If skitter agent touches your trip - and doesn\u2019t do a good job and gets a 8: YOU ARE GIVEN A 8. It takes 3 surveys of 9&10\u2019s to outweigh the one 8. They talk a good game to get you onboard but I dread going to work! They simply don\u2019t respect their colleagues by the way they treat us and how they handle it if we have an emergency or are out sick. ZERO EMPATHY! They don\u2019t care why. They just have lofty expectations which are not attainable unless you have 20 years of experience. Things constantly change and disrupt your rhythm yet you are held accountable when they don\u2019t train you well. Being 1 minutes EARLY to work is AGAINST YOU! That\u2019s crazy!! I would of asked for more pay if I\u2019d known. Tech issues happen yet you are blamed nonetheless and expected to own your career BUT NOT ON THEIR DIME. Trainers are amazing at first. Towards the end of training \u2014 they let you fall before helping you. Such a disappointment! MOST of my peers feel the same. We all wanted to believe but the promises aren\u2019t ever kept. So sad because our card members deserve more from American Express. I\u2019d leave but I need the money ProsVacation time, discounts, good benefits ConsMetrics, management, expectations, unkept promises 1.0 Senior Travel Counselor | Cleveland, OH | Jan 27, 2019 Bad Culture The tools we are given to preform our duties are always not working so we have to constantly have to rebook, and tell our caller we are sorry our computers are slow. Sr. level management do fuzzy math to sku the books for the investors. ie. add a hotel to a booking we did not book but the report counts as if we booked it. There is not mid level leadership- its peer to peer - Most have been with the company a long time and are waiting to reach the age of retirement so they can leave- they flat out tell you to not come to them for help leaving you to figure it out on your own. All Mondays and Fridays are blocked and not allowed to be taken off unless its in round 1 or 2 in PTO bid when you get a whole week off, or you call off the day of. Instead of keep with supporting account specific they sr level management is combining teams and also flips a switch at any time putting you other accounts with no training only a 1 page plan.- again leaving you to figure it out by yourself. Eventually it will become 1 big call center and you take whatever call you get from any of our clients companies pay raises are 1-2% - does not cover cost of living increase each year making less than the year before. Also cut our hours from 40 to 37.5 per week promising to go back to 40 after labor day then not reinstating the 40 hours - always breaking promisies- no follow through. no bonus. Proslots of PTO ConsSee some listed below but there are many more 3.0 Travel Counselor | Remote | Jul 14, 2018 Metrics are ridiculous American Express COULD be an amazing place to work if they changed their metrics to be reasonable and fair. You can be a top producer who is well liked by clients and still be reprimanded because you kept someone on hold too long. Or...your customer can love your service and then be transferred to another department in which their experience was negative and YOU take a hit for a bad survey when it was another agent they didnt like...its very unfair. There is no job security so even if you are doing a good job they can and will cut people at will so you are always walking on eggshells. Stress is greatly effected by the supervisor you have and there are many inconsistencies with policy. It would take so little for the company to revamp things to the satisfaction of employees for retention but no matter how many people make suggestions the company remains rigid; it's really a shame. The turnover is the highest I've ever seen in a large company in over 30 years in the travel industry...this SHOULD be something the company takes into consideration. The vacation benefits are VERY good but that is small compensation for extreme and unnecessary stress. I keep hoping for positive changes but it seems I only see the opposite. Disappointed to say the least ProsVacation ConsUnreasonable demands and unattainable metrics Questions And Answers about American Express How thorough of a background check do they do? Asked Apr 1, 2017 They went back 16 years on my background & did not give me the job because of something that happened when I was a minor. So i believe they go back as far as your record goes. Answered Jun 21, 2019 The background is more thorough and strict than any employer I have ever worked for. All information must be verifiable down to the letter or your initial offer will most definitely be rescinded. You can\u2019t really blame them since they are an international financial services organization, do the need to be cognizant of who is being hired in is very understandable. However, if it is something you really want I would suggest having all of your \u201ct\u2019s\u201d crosses and \u201ci\u2019s\u201d dotted. Answered Mar 9, 2019 What is the work environment and culture like at American Express? Asked Jul 12, 2016 Ever since leadership rushed into 'Delivery Transformation' initiative by converting Indian Vendor resources into full time leaders without proper training and HR controls in place, the culture has become more and more hostile, toxic and discriminatory. The cultural gap between US and India is a reality and poses a significant threat to the future of all American companies who employ same offshore model. It is not a matter of if but when we will see class act law suits against AMEX for discrimination. Answered Sep 22, 2019 Been with the company for almost 2 decades. The culture in customer service used to be quite nice. But many things changed in a short amount of time and in the past few years, the culture has become quite stressful and management is more concerned about making money than the welfare of the employees. It\u2019s all about selling. It has become a high pressure sales environment. Employees are just numbers now. Answered Jan 5, 2019 What would you suggest American Express management do to prevent others from leaving? Asked Mar 22, 2017 After 6 years of giving myself to Amex, one would think that they would at least pretend to care about why I left the company. I took a leave of absence and they denied my stress related leave as a reason for a leave of absence. I was stressed because of AMEX. It didnt matter if I made $100 per hour, the requirements were ridiculous and they only cared about #s and customer surveys. So please, when you top employees say they are stressed, at least take that into consideration. This experience caused me to never want to work in customer service AGAIN. Answered May 11, 2020 Stop laying off good people Answered Apr 11, 2020 What is American Express sick leave policy? How many sick days do you get per year? Asked Apr 2, 2017 12 days per year. A typical sick day policy includes five or six days of paid sick leave. Answered Jan 6, 2019 Sick time is awarded monthly at 4 hrs per month. Unlike vacation time, sick time accrues. Answered Jan 24, 2018 What are the hours at AMEX? Asked Mar 7, 2017 Do you have 10 hour days, 4 days a week? Do you have 12 hour days, 3 days a week? Do you offer weekends off, especially Sunday? Does this apply to work at home job? If you don't use your sick time ever, what happens with the hours? When do you get vacation time? How many weeks? Answered Mar 15, 2018 It depends on the role. As others have shared, hours in the call centers are 24/7/365 - call centers are never closed with the exception of a few departments/functions. Exempt employees within the call centers may work weekends, depends on their role. Exempt employees not supporting the call centers work Mon - Fri, anywhere from 6am to 6pm - depends on who they're wokring with, what project their on, work/life balance, etc. I once worked 5am - 130pm, Sun to Thu, in Phoenix, when supporting call center ops. A different role, I worked 6am - 6pm, Mon to Fri, because I worked with people on the East coast (they like their 9amET calls/meetings), had that much work to do and was exempt/salaried. \"What are the hours at AMEX?\" Depends on where you work (NYC has bankers hours, for the most part), what you do and who you work with (different time zones means greater flexibility; this is a pro and a con). AMEX, as a company, is never closed. Answered Nov 6, 2017",
