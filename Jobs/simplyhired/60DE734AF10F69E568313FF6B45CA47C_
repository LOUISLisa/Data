Every citizen\u2019s vote is sacred, and every citizen deserves evidence that our elections are free and fair. Forty states use voting machines that are over ten years old. Their technology is outdated, their source code proprietary and their security vulnerabilities \u2013 described in detail by the security community over many years \u2013 are left unpatched. It\u2019s not surprising that 76% of voters are concerned that our elections are vulnerable to hacking. And if voters lose trust in elections, then the very foundation of our democracy is at risk. We\u2019re using open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and modern product engineering to make elections dramatically safer, more accessible, and more affordable. Affordability may sound pedestrian, but it is key. The front line of America\u2019s election security rests in the hands of the 50% of US counties that struggle to afford basic services, let alone upgrade aging voting equipment. THE OPPORTUNITY We are builders. We don\u2019t just believe in the publicly owned operating system of democracy, we\u2019re building it. We believe in voting machines that delight voters, election officials, and security experts. And we\u2019re building them. We believe election officials need the right software to audit their elections. And we\u2019re building that, too. We\u2019re building the tools to help the public gain confidence that our elections are run well. If you\u2019re like us, you\u2019ve been thinking about the myriad problems and rough edges of our democracy for a while. We\u2019ve decided that talking about it isn\u2019t enough - we must do something. THE TEAM We work as a small, tight-knit team. We\u2019re a flat organization when it comes to ideas and input, and we believe in good management, even as a small organization, so that every VotingWorks team member gets regular feedback, guidance, and an opportunity for tremendous personal growth. We strive to be both confident in the skills and knowledge we each bring and humble in our interactions with each other and other stakeholders in the election space. THE ROLE You\u2019ll be writing code, reviewing code, reviewing product specs, contributing to product specs, working directly with voters, election officials, security experts, disability advocates, and more. Your code will help citizens cast and verify their votes. We don\u2019t work on hip but questionable ideas (ahem.. blockchain voting). We build high-reliability, well-tested and well-architected software that will stand the test of time. We know technology alone won\u2019t fix it. We\u2019re building code with empathy for voters, election officials, and the long history of the democratic process. We\u2019re looking for software engineers with 10+ years of professional software development and Web technology experience, ideally focused on backend and database. If you're a little bit shy of 10 years but you're particularly excited about the problems we're solving, do send us your resume. THE STACK We use Typescript, React, Node.js for the front-end, Python/Flask, PostgreSQL for the backend. We prefer if you know some of these technologies because we\u2019re a small team, but if you don\u2019t and you\u2019re game to learn them, you should still send us your resume. We\u2019re more interested in how well you understand Web technology and how much you love to learn and improve your skills than in your knowledge of specific programming languages or frameworks. If you prefer backend or frontend, that\u2019s great \u2013 almost every engineer has a preference. We\u2019re a small team, though, so you\u2019ll get a chance to work across the stack \u2013 and we\u2019ll almost certainly need you to. WITHIN 1 MONTH, YOU'LL contribute features to voting machine and/or verification software. WITHIN 3 MONTHS, YOU'LL contribute ideas to the entire architecture of our voting system take ownership of significant portions of our stack start to see your code help election officials and voters. WITHIN 12 MONTHS, YOU'LL be able to say that your code ran a real election in the United States, with many more to come. WE'RE FULLY DISTRIBUTED We\u2019re a fully distributed organization, which means that for most roles you can work from anywhere in the United States. We offer a flexible work schedule and we're on board with schedule flexibility: more than half of us have kids, and we enjoy attending their various sporting and non-sporting events. With flexibility comes responsibility: you should be comfortable with significant autonomous work. COMPENSATION We\u2019re a non-profit, so we compensate in cash and benefits exclusively. We won\u2019t pay you as much as a big for-profit, but we\u2019ll still pay you a very fair salary and competitive benefits. Compensation is commensurate with your skills and experience. WE'RE BUILDING A DIVERSE TEAM We never discriminate on the basis of sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, background, ability/disability or really anything that isn\u2019t about your skills. We strive to go beyond that: we want to build a diverse organization that truly represents the people of the United States of America. We especially want to encourage women and members of under-represented groups to apply.
