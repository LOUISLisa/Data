I would recommend this organization to anyone in the aviation industry 5.0 Reservation Agent | Los Angeles, CA | Aug 18, 2012 Productive Job environment Working at Quantas Airways was a life-changing experience. Moving caused me from leaving that job. If they had Quantas Airways in Atlanta, I would've been transferred. While I worked there, I met many well-known celebrities during the process. It's a great company to work in. Prosperfectly fitted schedule Consn/a 3.0 Customer Service Representative | Los Angeles, CA | Jan 14, 2015 Everyday different expectations What I love more the my job is the is no one day same as the other,in the airline business 5.0 Aeronautical Engineer | Los Angeles, CA | May 1, 2018 Excellent stepping stone I enjoyed working for Qantas. After working there for over 8 years, the management style is what drove me away. Manager (at the time) was a great people person, his management style was questioned (by many). Other than that, it was an awesome place to learn and work. ProsGreat place to learn and sharpen one's skills. Travel benefits ConsLabor protection was overseas. Manager did not seem to comply with set rules (at the time) 2.0 Regional Sales Manager | Chicago, IL | Feb 18, 2015 Very conservative company Australia focused, the US sales team has little impact on the decision made in Australia. This company has beeen around for a long time, there is a lot of competition going to Australia, Qantas is most arrogant for superior product, but other airlines have caught up to the service levels. Proshealth benefits ConsSenior leadership is a challenge 5.0 Customer Service Representative | Los Angeles, CA | Jan 10, 2020 enjoyable Productive and a fun active place to work ,keeps you on your toes . Working with management is easy going, questions are answered when asked ,a typical day at Quantas is like I said productive. 5.0 Maintenance Supervisor | Sydney, FL | May 27, 2019 Very competitive work force that were proud to work for the Australian iconas the rewards were great Strong team culture and excellent management team. Training and development of staff was first class.I enjoyed working at Qantas Airways. In the mornings our team would load up a kind of baggage trolley where our large tool boxes were kept and hooked up to a Toyota landcruiser and we had our coffee and a tool box meeting and discussed our work package for the day and how we were going to achieve the outcomes We left went to the Sydney International Airport for the arrival o 4-8 aircraft to be serviced by our team. After each aircraft had been checked and serviced and tech log defects repaired or were reassigned at a later time due to time constraints we assisted the flight crew in the departure of the aircraft. Some aircraft required to be towed from the airport to the Qantas hangars for major rectification and we towed the aircraft in to the hangars and commenced rectification on various A,B,and C checks as required. Prosdiscounts and free trips Conswas made redundant in 2006 1.0 Phone Operator | Ramp, WV | Jul 31, 2016 Management gives reduncies to hard workers! Well I worked for this airline for 16 years, and having put them for a reference to find employment is utterly disgusting. They have changed human resources officers like toilet paper not given a good reference or acknowledging I even worked there. Where other airlines require you to have Medium rigid or heavy rigid to work in cleaning , Qantas does not because they are looked after and other airlines are second rated. Qantas , since 2006, ten years have past , and they have increased their workforce by 40%. Those that have been given compulsory reduncies could have been given part time or casual employment. Disgusting. As for family life , working shift work 7 days a week not seeing the kids grow up , again disgusting. 1970's child care centres rarely existed now woman are forced to work and cook and clean and spend 30% of wages to child care centres ........ etc etc etc . ProsCannot think of anything. ConsDiscounted travel no guarantee on stand by for days!! 5.0 Account Manager | United States | Feb 7, 2015 Great team dynamic, challenging atmosphere and strong culture Greatest culture i have been able to work with. Great people, challenging work load, great management . Growth opportunity Motivating management team Great benifits USA ProsGrowth and challenge ConsNon 1.0 Aircraft Mechanic | Los Angeles, CA | Jul 4, 2019 Worst management Pay rate lower than another companies, unfair pay rate for between employees. Management has racist. Stupid schedule that no one like for aircraft mechanics. They're abusing the employees in US.
