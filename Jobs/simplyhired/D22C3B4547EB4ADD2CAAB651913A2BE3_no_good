Asked Sep 25, 2016 Working for MTA NYC came with a lot of respect, benefits and recognition from the company as well as ridership with certificates of excellence and other awards thanking me for a job well done. The salary is one of the highest in the USA. I retired in 2013 @ 27.00/hr My son is now employed there and the salary is $34.00/hr Answered Jul 23, 2019 I feel good and proud for being part of the big family with a decent and affordable salary, a lot of people look at you with respect for knowing that you work for the MTA. Answered Aug 17, 2018 When u apply for a mta job through their website and you application passed the pre screening. How long does it take for them to call you for an interview? Asked Sep 19, 2017 I have several jobs that have said \"passed pre screening\" for a year or more. I have never been called or emailed by anyone. Granted these are all LIRR jobs, don't know if that makes a difference. Answered Jan 25, 2019 It all depends on their \"cycles\". You might land on their immediate cycle on will call you within a week or two. Or, they'll save your name for the next cycle and will get a call within a month or so. As long as you're clean from drugs and don't have an outstanding background, it's worth the wait. Don't ever think that they'll ignore your application unless you gave them the wrong phone #/email address to contact you. *Yikes!* Answered Jul 12, 2018 What is the training for bus driver like? Asked Aug 11, 2017 A ghettofied boot camp. Very strict rules on attendance, timing, and cell phone prohibition during class. First 5 weeks is class(textbook)/driving, and the last 3 weeks is driving with a variety of mentors with their assigned routes so you can get the understanding of the job. Once you graduate, your job will get easier as time goes and you will love being out there on the road. *You must have very thick skin and mental focus to endure the training. Some instructors have a way to get on your nerves. But get pass thru the noise, and you'll be alright!* Answered Jul 12, 2018 Intense. Never a dull moment Answered Dec 8, 2017 Are there MTA work at home jobs? Asked Mar 19, 2017 None that I know of. Even if it's computer work, or engaging with customers, it's hardly or rarely any home work assignments. They will always have a \"place\" like the union station or by any other rail stations to do light work if you're not going to be driving. Answered Jul 12, 2018 No MTA work at all jobs are for driving the bus Answered Jun 16, 2017 How long does it take to hear back after completing the drug testing part of the mta stock warehouse position?
