supporting the aerospace, aero structure, defense, medical, plastic injection molding industry to name but a few, my first reaction to the present day posing micro manager approach was in sheer disgust and contempt. Lately, I have encountered an ageing board of CEO and administration who woo the woman staff and virtually ignore the male counterparts. \u2022 \u2022 Sadly, the budget support of the quality department falls far below the priority level which \u2022 compromises the accuracy and adherence to any given company's quality clauses. \u2022 Instead they spend company dollars on 1st and 2nd party body count who defragments the immediate \u2022 order of command, thus becoming broken, frayed leaving temptation to frustration through a reckless chain of \u2022 over staffed microscopic specialists, who juggle the department\u2019s budget, veto your suggestion \u2022 because it compromises their self-indulgent over expenditure while over analyzing and critique your job duties and \u2022 workmanship procedures and vow there is a better way while claiming that we do not need to purchase better equipment. \u2022 \u2022 But before the door opens and closes there is that (standard operational bull****) trail of paperwork that can leave you in dismay. \u2022 Then it is \"Congratulations and welcome new fish\". We will see if we can find a place for you to sit and get you up and surfing \u2022 in the company sea.

A typical day started with me arriving at about 645 so that I could printout the paper work and review it and up date the boards before the morning meeting. At 7 the rest of my team would arrive and log on their computers. At 705 we would have the morning meeting in which I would present the work flow, parts numbers, and other key points since the previous day. Then our manager would say a few encouraging remarks and then we would go and prep for the days inspections. Pepping would include pulling out our tools, checking emails for non-conformance reports, lab test results, commodity buyer responses, stockroom requests, and general updates. Next we would go to the line and in order of first in, first out we would select a package of parts, open them and begin inspection. First we would check the part number, name, quantity, revision, and clauses against its paperwork. Next was the visual inspection for any obvious signs of cosmetic damage. Then we would printout the technical drawing from our files and match them to our parts. Using calipers, height gauges, and diameter gauges we were able to measure parts to a .03 tolerance level. After that came a final review of the paperwork. If every thing was correct then we would accept the parts, and printout tags to track the parts throughout the facility. If parts didn't conform then they would be removed and placed into quarantine until they were dealt with. this involve isolating the parts, sending reports to the buyers and manufa...more 1.0 Quality Assurance Inspector | Santa Maria, CA | Oct 11, 2015 A big Garage Shop with poor Quality management. I was told, by another employee, that you need to know nothing about what you're doing to advance here. Just show up and work like an ant. At a morning meeting we were told that if you worked from the usual start of 6AM until 12AM(18 hours) you didn't have to come in at 6AM the next day, you could come in at 8AM. Well that's really big of you. I was a contractor in Quality with a lot of experience at top companies and this place has a lot to learn about producing a quality product. Their rank and file employees have little to no experience and the people that are supposedly training them only know what they were told while working there. It's the blind leading the blind. When rejecting hardware, the common excuse is \"We've always done it that way.\" Before I went to work there, my recruiter told me that they were trying to change the culture. If they're trying to make it bad they've succeeded and if they're trying to make it good then they've failed miserably. They need to start with more Quality gates to get their lousy quality under control. Where's the Quality reporting? It's non-existent. How can you make meaningful Quality charts without defect reporting so you can fix the problems? Production needs more supervision and training because so many assemblers have no idea what's contained in the specs that they're supposed to be building this stuff to.Middle Managers have admitted to me that they don't have the proper facilities to produce to the specs.

Company. Ever. Zodiac Services Americas is the worst company I have ever worked for. Longstanding issues exist at every level and management seems incapable of identifying either problems or solutions. The company suffers from an atmosphere of class and favoritism, and employees are discouraged from questioning management. The company management style is based on intimidation, and employees are continually criticized for performance despite a lack of clear instruction. Within the customer service department, customers are treated horribly, mostly due to uneven workload among employees with varying proficiencies. The customer service manager rarely leaves her office and seems completely unaware of the obstacles facing customer service representatives. The customer service supervisor seems reluctant to get involved, and projects are routinely delegated to employees without the skills or experience to complete them effectively. Employees are overworked, underpaid and treated poorly. In return they are asked to hold their complaints, raise their morale and memorize the company mission statement. Sadly there is no support from human resources, whose director is the loudest person I have ever heard in a professional setting. She often uses speakerphone despite the proximity of people actually working, and it is not uncommon to hear conversations that include personal information. Lastly, consider that earlier this year the company completed a transition of ERP systems, and that despite delays ...more Prosconvenient access to old national highway Consjumbojets pass overhead every 3 minutes 1.0 | Redmond, WA | Feb 17, 2016 Extremely-poor management and inconsiderate coworkers. Expect little to no formal training, and then be held accountable for not performing a task \"right\". You are expected to follow a \"rule book\" for all procedures, but the rule book is full of contradictions and incorrect procedures. Management is extremely sloppy - nobody knows exactly what is going on at any given time. The managers play \"Favorites\". One person will get in trouble for doing something, while the other won't, for the same thing. They fail to provide the staff with the tools they need / request. They will overstaff you and provide you with too few tools. You will CONSTANTLY be fighting over tools. That is likely the reason the company can't achieve a 100% on-time rate. But they refuse to supply. You will be lectured DAILY about your mistakes (made because you were never taught properly by anyone). You will be wrong no matter what you do. You will be lectured by a different person each day who will disagree with the person who lectured you the previous day. Most of the staff is very rude. Expect a lot of gossip. Even from managers. I had coworkers report to me the things managers have said about me behind my back. Expect it to be very hard to concentrate on a task because people are loud and inconsiderate for the entire shift. You may come to work with a motivation to work hard, but it will quickly be stolen away from you. It is impossible to clock-in and get to your station before encountering some form of drama.

There are two different shifts (7 a.m. - 4 p.m. and 4 p.m. - 1 a.m.) with a one hour lunch break to give all the employees an ample chance to eat either in the in-house cafeteria or get take-out for the numerous near-by fast-food options. A typical day begins with the intercom bell signalling that employees should be at their respectives workstaions and logged into their project. After about two hours of work, the 10 minute break bell rings to give employees a chance to smoke, snack, or go to their cars to make personal calls. For security reasons, cell phones must be left in employee lockers during working hours. Two more hours of work, then lunch, work, break, work, then log off your project and clock out. The work is challenging and varied enough to be interesting. Strict quality control and a time limit made me want to do things right the first time. The challenge for me was keeping within the time budget I recieved with the projects. The supervisors were fair and understanding when I went through a prolonged illness that eventually required surgery. The major downside to working at Safran is the poor air quality. I am not prone to sinus infections but in the 2 years I worked there, I contracted 4 serious sinus infections that resulted in bronchitis and requried me to be out of work for an average of four days each. In addition, to save money the air conditioner is tu...more ProsInteresting work, Great Supervisors ConsPoor air quality 4.0 Quality Assurance Inspector | Santa Maria, CA | Apr 13, 2016 Ran By Clueless consultants I loved this place because of the people, I hated this place because of the people. Everyone is super nice, what i mean about the above everyone not one the production floor, is detached, really really really detached, they may meet about a issue talk about an issue and make decisions, but when your not involved in every way bad decisions are made and that is what plagues this place. There is an US vs. Them feeling where someone with title may try and step one you to get there way and the response is usually bad output. Also when its time for them to let you go )they routinely over-staff and basically put you job at risk every 3-6 months) they have security and all this embarrassing unnecessary stuff involved and gone you are! Now those are some of the fairly common negatives, the great thing about this place is chance, you may if you work very hard build good relationships, land a very amazing role..

We currently have lean projects going on which is what im currently working on and trying to better the process flow when we finally get a good amount of work in. I am involved in pretty much every process of a slide assembly overhaul which consist of opening, testing, evaluation, repair, packing and certifying the slide assembly to be shipped out with a 8130-3 release tag.

They hire foreign subcontractors that they can easily remove. They take advantage of promoting that they are an international company and that you need no German to work for them, but all the legal documents are in German and they provide no translation/interpretation most of the time. They distribute warnings like they would distribute doughnuts. They don't encourage employees to learn German and keep the foreign workers in clans so that they don't get mixed with native Germans and thus remain easier to manipulate and threaten. Trainings are only kept for managers. It is a managers company, they get paid well and get trained on behalf of everybody else, while they don't work hard and show up between 9.30 am and 3 pm most of the time, and this is way they bring no new projects for the company, and instead of being fired themselves, they use their power to fire their employees stating that the economical situation is tough. Many managers allow themselves to call you to their office and tell you that they are planning on firing you without any HR person by your side. Modern slavery. Very poor promotions, would be inexistent if the German law didn't require so.
