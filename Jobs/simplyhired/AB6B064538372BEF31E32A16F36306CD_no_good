I would like to just start out in the beginning and make very clear this my experience as a manager with this company. I was hired as an Inventory Manager and shortly after was promoted to Area Manager. Although I never held the title of inventory associate (counter) I can say I have done this job also. My initial position of Inventory Manager started out actually somewhat enjoyable. The end of the year is the slow season for inventories so my schedule was actually very acceptable. I ran a few inventories and helped with the hiring/training of new employees. This process should have clued me in how my experience was going to be with this company. I can honestly say I rarely got to know my new hires because they were gone with in a month. I have to say this is not just the companies fault. For every good employee I hired there were 9 other employees who were useless. They would all be excited to work and when the time came for their first shift, no show! After a few months I was \"promoted\" to a position similar to Area Manager. All the responsibilities of that position, but very small change in compensation. My boss had just up and left the company like so many other managers do. This was just in time for the start of our incredibly chaotic first of the year. As the only manager in my office it became my responsibility to do everything. Every office in this company has hourly supervisors that run certain inventories and help with running cr...more ProsFree shirt ConsNo life, bad pay, horrible work culture 1.0 Manager | New York State | Jun 8, 2013 Beware. Do not work for this company. It is awful on every level of existence. Compensation / Benefits is not competitive for the field. Their culture and values are to make as much money as possible with a complete disregard to employee safety. Yes, I was forced to drive 6 hours to a get to a job, work for 8 hours, then drive home for 6 hours. Since i was on salary, no break considerations were made. Then I would be questioned why I didn't answer my phone immediately 3 hours after arriving home. The District Manager needed people at the store, so there were no considerations made. As far as job security and advancement, this is the one category that could possibly be rated better than one star, but ultimately isn't. If you do a good job as an Inventory Manager, you may get promoted. Ultimately, though, that is where the line ends. There are so few District and Regional managers that there is not a lot of opportunity there. The \"corporate bs\" really begins at the DM level, so if there are problems they don't take as much responsibility as the Area and Inventory Managers. Moving on to management, all of the upper management are very poor managers for the most part. They have very little fiscal sensibility, which leads them to only look at a small portion of an overall financial statement. They also only look at problems after the fact, complaining when a P&L statement is unsatisfactory. However, they never take the proactive steps beforehand to improve the P&L and help to work out pro...more ProsYou might get promoted from Inventory Manager ConsToo many to list, see review. 4.0 Inventory Associate | Sacramento, CA | Jul 24, 2012 Counting down products and items while putting info into the wizard so that the stores will know what items to order and what items not to order. The job is good for a person who wants a part-time job and not worried about the hours. You are not guarantee a whole 30 to 40 hrs, you could be schedule maybe two days out of one week and two weeks could go by before you are scheduled again, so if you are looking for a part-time work with more hours this is not the job for you. Not only that but you have to check your schedule online, you do not know when you are schedule for a job until you look it up so that means you have to check every day and see if your name appears on the schedule list and if you have an appointment on that day then you have to email the manager because there is no-way to contact any manager by phone, only by email and sometimes you do not know which manager you should contact if an emergency should arise which I was finding it very difficult. You have to be fast in counting each items on the rack and shelves inculding little items. You also have to work with people of different age and race, in my opinion jobs like this should closely monitor new employees before making them permanent. When you have some employees cursing while customers are shopping and managers are more worried about being on top of other Inventory Companies, that will make the company very unprofessional. The most hardest part of the job is when you first begin a Inventory position, you have a quota that you have to make, if you do not make that quota it is count against you which I do not believe it to be unfair to any new employ...more Prostravel to different cities and states, learning how to take inventory Consthe hours, speed of counting for first time employees, meeting your quota 1.0 Inventory Associate | Daytona Beach, FL | Oct 2, 2012 Where do I start?! This \"job\" was the worst I have ever had. After being laid off from a decent job and not working for 2 years, WIS came along and gave me a \"job\". It had its okay days but normally they were bad days. The veterans will warm up to you once they realize you are not going anywhere but until that point be ok with sitting by yourself on breaks and not talking to anyone on van rides. You wont be included. Speak up. Learn to be quick at this job otherwise you will be made fun of. Honestly, you can do great at this job and they will still fire you for anything. I lasted 10 months, still not sure how I made it that far. I never got a raise because they kept looking me over. Co-workers can and WILL include druggies, criminals and people you would never associate with on your personal time. Upper management from corporate comes in rarely but when they do, you know its them driving up in the BMW or Mercedes. And they are rude! Supervisors can be someone who has worked there a year or someone literally off the street. BAD BAD management. They care little if your sick, have children,etc. This is a rush-rush job- rush to get to the job, rush to get the job done, rush on your break to find something to eat(you are usually in a publix, if they let you buy food from there), bad looks are given when you go to the bathroom during count time and rush to get home.

I started working for this company in November of 2015, from the very beginning during my interview, I should have known I was making a huge mistake. When I arrived at the Marietta, GA location for my interview, I sat and waited for 35-40 minutes, my interview was scheduled for 11:00 am. During my interview I was told that I would receive a company issued shirt(polo style) and a name badge, neither of which I received and I stopped working for the company 4 days ago. The scheduling is absolutely horrendous, you are scheduled for an assignment scheduled for 5 am and depending on how many people actually show up if they are scheduled, you may be lucky enough to finish the job by 12 noon. They will schedule a job for 5 am and you won't get out of there until 4 pm that afternoon, maybe later than that. Then you are either scheduled for another job that evening with a start time ranging anywhere from a meet time of between 5-8 pm and the job starting at 9pm. You may also be scheduled for another job right after that assignment for the next morning. Once the schedule is sent out for the week, there is a notice on your schedule that if you have a conflict with a job that you are scheduled for, to please notify them immediately so that they can arrange for a replacement. If you do that, you will get written up, no matter what. They do not car...more ProsOpportunity to meet new people.

You will be LIED TO continuously about pay, like if the managers screw up and input pay wrong or tell you you'll be paid for different hours you'll get even LESS on your check. You'll get the run-around from both the area managers only to be literally screamed at for someone else's short comings and mistakes, and have BOTH area managers blame the other AND the regional manager then turn around and tell you other co-workers short comings are on you as well... They'll make you go days without proper sleep from over working you store after store for days on end and then complain that you didn't count accurately and write you up for basically being human. I even have write ups from stores that cancelled due to unsanitary conditions of the store or low staff that were promised to be removed. Co-workers, actually store SUPERVISORS (Wis supervisors not the actual stores), can harass and literally physically threaten you and when you bring it to your area managers attention nothing will happen except them asking \"well what do you want MEE to do about it\" But they'll literally yell and scream and fire you for the day for actually listening to what...more 2.0 Inventory Manager | Richmond, VA | Apr 16, 2015 If you have other options, STAY AWAY..... If you have a family or any type of hobbies or social life then this place is not for you. As a Inventory Manager expect 10 plus hour shifts with ease. Expect to come in at 3am and not end your day until 7pm, then have to be back in at 3am again the next morning. If the job is out of town expect to be forced to drive the crew while you are still exhausted, while everyone else including the Area Manager sleeps (nice to hear those snores for 2 hours). No formal training when you start, you are thrown in left to figure things out and help with no clue. As a manager that's not a great perception to the inventory staff, but you try. They rather have you in stores standing around versus taking the time to learn the business in a nice training platform. Your training class is at home on your own personal time...No Pay...you're on salary they got you now... Not a great compensation amount for what they expect from you. Now if you are a loner and don't sleep much, then this is perfect for you... I'm in a long list of Inventory Managers that have come and gone. Once I heard from the staff that have been around for years, about how they've seen so many IMs leave and they are surprised that you are still there...RED FLAG...it's almost a running joke.

Normally you will get few hours or too many hours(at a cost). If they are understaffed prepare to do back to back shifts, but hey you get overtime right? depending on the time you can get overtime pay if you start your day in the morning yes but lets say you start your day at 4pm you work 5hours get unpaid lunch at 9pm and get back to work at 9:30 and work another 5 hours(which will happen) and you and your team finishes the store you are doing at 2:30 am and worked worked a total of 10 hours and earned a total of 8 hours pay and 2 hours overtime right? well according to them its all regular pay because their policy is that once midnight hits it is a new day so they start you as hour one is this legal well that's why they always have lawsuits on their hands.

Different retailer, different city, different coworkers, different boss. Yes, if you do two JCPennys or two Victoria's Secret you will probably have the same boss(es) and some of the same coworkers, and the jobs will be done pretty much the same, but something is always slightly different. Some jobs are done in town but a lot of them are out of town (I'm in Tucson so we would go to Yuma, Phoenix and surrounding areas, Thatcher, Douglas, Ajo and everywhere in between, plus some out of state jobs). I learned how inventory control works from the inventory companies point of view, which is actually pretty cool because you learn things you wouldn't have thought about from a retail standpoint. The management is generally good, the office I worked out of had a GREAT area manager and good inventory managers, but I have never actually spoken to anyone higher up than my area manager. My coworkers were (mostly) awesome, we would joke around with each other on van rides and on breaks and everyone is pretty friendly. The hardest part of the job was the hours. Some days you may leave the office at 1230 in the morning to get to Yuma and sometimes not get back until 8 at night. Also, you never know when you're going to get off work, you're there until the job is done and no two jobs are alike. So even though you might have finished a job in 3 hours, the same retailer at a different location might take 7 hours to finish.

I dont have enough time in the day to write a novel on how I would make it a better place to work. here are some bullet points - PAY OVERTIME, STOP CHEATING WORKERS OUT OF TRAVEL TIME - Create a actual way to get a raise, CPH based raises are unfair - give management updated computers not 10+ years old - make management hourly not salary paid - give workers more than one shirt for a uniform - create incentives for working back to back shifts - make schedule more reliable Answered Jul 8, 2020 Don't hire the people they hire it was a horrible working environment they say they do back ground checks I don't believe it especially when people were saying who they were when I worked Answered Jun 30, 2020 When you travel or go to different stores do you go in your own car or company vehicle Asked May 21, 2016 Well in Fresno we have a choice to drive our personal vehicle or ride in the company van on out of town trips.

Asked Apr 19, 2016 In illinois its 12 while counting with chances of raises every 3 months. Its based off the level your counting at, your appearance and accuracy etc. If your a driver you will have another pay rate of 13 from the time you take off at meet spot till your destination. Any time that van moved (excluding getting food) your paid for your drive time. Then for passengers its 9.25 after the 1st hour of travel. So if your leaving a hotel and stores under an hour your not paid for travel. Then each night your in a hotel you get a per diem added to your check. Answered Feb 10, 2020 The pay is horrible. It's basically minimum wage no matter what state you're from. Fast food workers get paid more and do less than what WIS requires you to do to earn a check. And at times employees are put in dangerous conditions to even count. let's not talk about the lowes in the middle of winter and have to be outside til everything is done being counted and get ridiculed if you step inside to get warm for a couple minutes or to get your scanner to work correctly because it froze. Let's not talk about the numerous stores in the summer with no ac or fans and you're dripping in sweat ready to pass out from heat exhaustion. The benefits are terrible. I went to a few different doctors (( eye, pcp )) and still had to pay damned near the entire thing out of pocket because the benefits from WIS covers basically nothing. What's the point of taking the money out of the checks for medical and to be told you have none and laughed at because you thought you had medical coverage and couldn't even afford the office visit. they o rework the life out of you and most times they'd rather keep all the trouble makers there instead of getting rid of them. In turn causes a lot of the reliable, dependable, fast counters and great employees overall to either get fired or quit. Terrible company.
