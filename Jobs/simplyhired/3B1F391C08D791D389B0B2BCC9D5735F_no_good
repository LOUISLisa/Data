To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential. Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone. And we never give up. For every child, innovate... UNICEF has a 70-year history of innovating for children. We believe that new approaches, partnerships and technologies that support realizing children\u2019s rights are critical to improving their lives. The Office of Innovation is a creative, interactive, and agile team in UNICEF. We sit at a unique intersection, where an organization that works on huge global issues meets the startup thinking, the technology, and the partners that turn this energy into scalable solutions. UNICEF's Office of Innovation creates opportunities for the world's children by focusing on where new markets can meet their vital needs. We do this by: Connecting youth communities (or more broadly - anyone disconnected or under-served) to decision-makers, and to each other, to deliver informed, relevant and sustained programmes that build better, stronger futures for children. Provoking change for children through an entrepreneurial approach - in a traditionally risk-averse field - to harness rapidly moving innovations and apply them to serve the needs of all children. Creating new models of partnership that leverage core business values across the public, private and academic sectors in order to deliver fast, and lasting results for children. The Office of Innovation specifically looks to form partnerships around frontier technologies (like drones and UAVs, blockchain, 21st century skills, urban technologies, new banking tools, wearables and sensors, or 3D-Printing) that exist at the intersection of $100 billion business markets and 1 billion person needs \u2013 and to identify how they can grow and scale profitably and inclusively. Our Team We're an interdisciplinary team around the world tasked with identifying, prototyping, and scaling new technologies and practices. With our partners, we focus on convening and collaborating on new and different solutions, low- and high-tech, by: Looking at the 2-5 year horizon to evaluate emerging and trending technologies and to see how UNICEF can work with the private sector on doing better business while improving essential services for children; Investing in early stage solutions that show great potential to positively impact children in the 0-2 year future including the Venture Fund that invests in open source technology solutions from start-ups based in UNICEF\u2019s programme countries; Identifying proven solutions that can be implemented at national scale in multiple countries \u2013 taking the ideas that help thousands in one country, bringing them to dozens of countries across multiple sectors, and impacting the lives of millions of children.\u201d How can you make a difference? The Office of Innovation seeks a top-level candidate who can intake, prioritize and toggle nimbly between multiple projects coming from a geographically dispersed team and who can lead design work to execute visually compelling and technically clear outputs for projects.

We seek someone who has proven experience coordinating multiple projects of varying degree and timelines and who knows how to work alongside a multidisciplinary team with backgrounds in communications, development, operations, partnership building, science, engineering and new and emerging technologies. Good communication is key, so we seek a candidate who knows how to articulate our work and our goals easily amongst a diverse range of staff who range in their understanding of design, and who has a knack for extrapolating information that can be utilized to improve ideas. We are looking for someone who can build new networks and partnerships in the world of social innovation design that are accelerators for UNICEF\u2019s work. The candidate should be able to document these relationships and suggest them to other team members as resources for furthering their work. The role requires someone with a diverse and hybrid background, someone who loves to creatively problem-solve, who can ideally work across various devices and platforms, who understands both traditional design and the large spectrum of digital and web mediums.

This also includes providing design expertise to key strategic projects such as U-Report, Innovation Acceleration priorities, the Innovation Fund, and GIGA. Manage a roadmap for integrating strategic design approaches, including human-centred design (HCD), into the Office of Innovation\u2019s practice both within the team and throughout the organisation. The initiatives may include but are not limited to: supporting the Scale team in country level testing and documentation of HCD in UNICEF\u2019s work; and designing and facilitating internal product sprints with the design team.
