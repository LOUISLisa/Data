Parsippany, NJ | Aug 12, 2014 Overall good company, but no career advancement opportunities; horrendous pay and benefits I have read many of the reviews on here and most seem to be from those actually providing the care. I work in one of the Support Offices (Corporate offices) and I would not recommend working in the Parsippany, NJ office. While I genuinely feel the company cares about its clients, I don't feel it cares about its employees. My office has a \"high school\" mentality where you need to make sure you \"fit in\" or else working there will be miserable. The Directors clearly pay favorites and will only promote those they favor and who are \"in\" with them. This has resulted in a work environment where the majority of the Division is unhappy...and yet, the Directors and Division Director choose to do nothing about it. They prefer the \"head in the sand\" approach rather than addressing the real issues. If you show you are unhappy, they will throw you to curb. Bayada practice is to fire someone on the spot without any advance warning. Often times they will just say \"you don't fit in\" and that \"it's best you part ways with Bayada\". Talk about professional! This Division also does not have advancement opportunities. They will only promote those they favor, who are often times people that have been with the company for years. It doesn't matter what degrees you have or prior work experiences, they only care about your time at Bayada. This is actually their business approach, not pure speculation. Also, this Division is not open to change. They run things the same way they...more ProsGreat co-workers, with a great sense of comradery ConsBenefits & pay are appalling; No career advancement; Directors play favorites; very \"high school\" 4.0 Nursing Assistant | Pittsburgh, PA | Sep 6, 2018 Not horrible. Has a few issues that could be fixed The company\u2019s job is to sell itself as being a dream come true for it\u2019s employees AND clients. People who need these services don\u2019t have a whole lot of options available to them. I have worked for the same office on and off over the past 8 years. There is a high turnover in the office itself. In fact, I think only 2 case managers are still there after all these years. The case managers are overwhelmed with case loads. The newer ones I\u2019ve come across have been less than satisfactory in job performance and have no qualms with making clients and employees feel inferior. I don\u2019t mind the mandatory inservices because I like being prepared for whatever challenges may come, but as previously stated in an earlier review, CNA\u2019s or HHA don\u2019t provide much nursing. It is easy to feel like we are merely babysitters and maids because the tasks may seem mundane or redundant. However, I feel like I offer more. An ear to listen when the parents are stressed beyond most of our comprehension, a hug to let them know they can find the strength to get through another day. Being a decent human being, and genuinely caring, not because I get paid to, but because it is who I am and what I believe in. I do not receive any benefits through Bayada. Location of clientele is a major factor to think about before taking cases. If you have been a CNA for a long time, it is hands down better than working in any nursing home or hospital. I have done so many fun activities in the community with clients such as...more ProsChoosing your clientele based on your availability and location, Meet wonderful people, Weekly pay, Free training. Free pre employment physicals. Free clearance and background checks, More satisfying than working in a short staffed facility ConsHours usually drop significantly when kids go back to school, Benefits are way too expensive, May not be anybody to cover your case if you need a day off 4.0 Private Duty Nurse | Fayetteville, NC | Feb 17, 2020 Supportive work environment for employees Bayada Raleigh, is a very supportive home health culture that makes you feel valued and appreciated as an employee. Other offices like Wilmington do so as well, and what I love about Bayada is that if there is a need and you are willing, you can cover a broad territory and cover many hours in home health. In a thriving office like this one, they have a good reputation and are well sought after for clients, so they will tailor your schedule just as you like, and you chose the clients and level of complexity according to what you like and your competency clearances, which are done in the office. It\u2019s great if you desire flexibility of scheduling, day, evening or night, what days you want to work, or need to take off. I have worked in many roles throughout my nursing career, hospital, office, managed care, and home health. This particular role is one of the most rewarding, satisfying, stress- free ( very important for your longevity!) and peaceful roles I have experienced, and I enjoy it very much. I would recommend this for a nurse that has at least a year or 2 of nursing, because you want to have some sense of second nature response to decompensation; you don\u2019t want to think just because it\u2019s home care it\u2019s easy: You want to know that in an emergency, those nursing instincts will kick in and you will calmly know what to do to intervene, possibly even preventing the need for hospitalization. Of course, there is training and skills labs, and you can even go to the offi...more ProsGreat supportive culture, 1 week paid PTO after 2000 hrs ( 1 yr or less depending on how many hours you work, earning valuable gifts and prizes through the company store, great families to work with through this office ConsUnfortunately doesn\u2019t pay as much as an RN should receive for the private duty role 1.0 Client Services Manager | Delaware | Oct 21, 2019 Honestly, terrible. To start, I did not feel set up for success. There isn't any real training for the position and others don't have the time to properly train due to monstrous workloads. I felt without a real understanding of my role until I had done something wrong and was scolded for it. I felt my position being threatened if I had ever made a mistake, even if I didn't know I was responsible for a certain task. I did not feel support from my coworkers or the higher-ups and often felt as though bottom dollar was what they were after, despite many efforts to voice ethical concern. By the end of it, I was responsible for doing other people's jobs on top of a tremendous caseload. Even when you're drowning, you're expected to get over it and add more work to your pile. Work-life balance was terrible, as I felt the expectation was to be available during all non-working hours, PTO, etc. I was getting calls in the middle of the night, weekends, and holidays. I felt little understanding for PTO for big family special occasions or even during inclement weather when there are emergencies. You're still expected to be there. I was one of very few Client Services Managers in my office and there were many times where I couldn't take a break, be out of the office on client visits, etc. if my counter-part was out that day. Be prepared to be tethered to a desk all day. I constantly felt as if there needed to be more people will full time positions to make your work manageable. To be truthful, the work is ...more ProsFree lunches, Christmas gifts, company events ConsWork life balance, poor management, poor training, unrealistic expectations 2.0 Registered Nurse | Marriottsville, MD | Aug 12, 2015 Poor orientation and management No life/work balance, no orientation program, no goals set for orientees, very difficult to learn from their preceptors. Tried to request changes to help me succeed, management refused. They promised me many things to get me to take the position, then after I accepted the position, they changed everything they told me. They promised certain benefits, then after being hired, I found out the benefits were not the same as promised. I truly wanted to succeed, however, they had no orientation process/goals, and had me as an RN orient with an LPN, whose job was completely different then an RN in the company. Documentation until 3am on first week. They did not show me the computer system, said I had to learn on my own. As a new nurse coming into home health, which they knew, I had less than 2 months orientation with an LPN, not RN, to learn everything. I quit to save my liscense or be audited and charged with medicare fraud by not filling out documents appropiatley from no orientation. The preceptor asked ME what I wanted to do each day, instead of telling me so I could progress. The director would not speak to me in private without the preceptor, would not change the preceptor, then said I should have acheieved all these goals, of which I had no idea because they never told me. I truly wanted to succeed, but they had not set orientation program for a new nurse. They were more interested in gossip all day at the office instead of helping orient me. ProsI wanted to be a home health RN Consprecepted me with LPN not RN, no orientation goals made clear, horrible benefits, cheap company, gossip, would not listen to the issues I was having in order to help me, \"The Bayada Way\" I never saw in anyone 1.0 Paraprofessional | Kahului, HI | Jun 27, 2019 Unorganized and disrespectful I worked for Bayada for 1 year. When I started I was a fulltime paraprofessional. I worked 5 days a week, normal school days. Our supervisors would come to school and evaluate our performance once a month with our client. I never recieved that much support, I asked questions on how to help the child and areas I had trouble. No support. Instead I got accused of abuse when of my clients came to school with nail Mark's on his wrist. I had to take the child to health room everyday before school and after school to prove he had no new marking from being with me. I was switched off of cases left and right. I never got to build a report with my clients and everything that set a child back due to switch parapross was my fault somehow and they switched me again. In December of last year I began questioning my employment, I kept being pulled off of cases and then not given new ones with child who attend school. I was missing too much work. I decided to look for work in mainland and relocate. I gave all 3 of my supervisors my resignation. I was told in monthly meetings that they wish me the best of luck. Towards the od the school year they didnt assing me any new clients. Just texted me randomly an hour before school started asking me to sub for someone. I was lucky to get 2 days of work. And half the time I turned it down cause it was too last minute. They completely messed with me and treated me so poorly. I would never recommend this company. What's worse is now they have told me t...more 3.0 Registered Nurse | Gastonia, NC | May 10, 2016 Enjoyable job with little variation. A typical day at work includes performing routine assessments on the child I am working with. I provide various types of care to this children including: medication administration, tracheostomy care, g-tube maintenance and care, physical therapy and respiratory treatments (suctioning, nebulizer treatments, oxygen administration). I have learned how to think critically during respiratory emergencies working with children who have trachs and ventilators. My management can be variable. Sometimes communication is on point and other times confusion sets in. The people who staff the cases do not have medical backgrounds so sometimes it can be a challenge with staffing. I enjoy working with my co-workers, mainly when I get the opportunity to train new nurses. I enjoy sharing my knowledge with new nurses and ensuring the client's are left in safe care. The hardest part of my job is not becoming too close to these families. The nurse works a lot with the child and becomes almost a part of the family. Parting ways or switching cases can be difficult depending on the connection already formed with the prior child. I enjoy being able to educate these families. I have learned a lot from the parents and have found ways to meet in the middle while still adhering to policies and orders. I have also enjoyed being one of the child's main advocates. A home health nurse is responsible for the nursing aspect, along with respiratory, PT, OT, and speech. The nurse works directly with all s...more ProsFlexible schedule, hours readily available ConsNo lunch break, PTO builds very slowly 1.0 Home Health Aide | Beverly, MA | Dec 3, 2018 Low Pay, Not recommend to anyone I would not recommend to work for Bayada Home Health Care. There are multiple reasons here 1) They simply do not pay well. My hourly pay start 13 dollars per hour. Even I have told Manager that I have 8 years of experience of health care as CNA and Last hourly pay I was receiving from previous employer was 17.52 per hour. It clearly seems that they do not considered my experience and not showing any respect to give any raise even cents. Manager stated me that after 6 month of evaluation, she may give 50 cents up. This means only 13.50 per hour. Why not 3 months? 2) They do not pay for gas mileage if you only have one client per day. It is not worse to drive to work for short period of time, you will have to pay your own gas. 3) Clients I experienced were all requests ONLY CLEANING, and heavy one. This was Including Toilet cleaning, Scrubbing bath tub, bleaching floor and washing pots and pans, thanksgiving dishes filled up in the sink, even though family members living with a client. I think Clients and family member abusing HHA as Maid or house keeping lady something else. They leave house hold job for you to do for only 13 dollar per hour. I pay 200 dollars for house keeping lady to clean my condo for 2 to 3 hours in MA 13.50 per hour for cleaning toilet job and washing wall is not worth it at all.

I have worked in this field for many years and never had a problem. Bayada treated me so poorly. First, with giving me a client that had strict instructions not to be with my gender. When an adverse event occurred, I was blamed and the meeting was held in public in front of a cell phone store. Humiliating. I was accused of using my phone at work. I offered to get phone records to prove this wasn't the case. They said it wasn't necessary and took me off the client. I was not making enough to pay my rent and so I continued with two jobs. Unfortunately, I had a mental health issue and had to cancel a shift and take a break from work. Bayada at first said they were very understanding. I got into therapy, learned how to manage my time, and healed past trauma. Three months later, I reached out to explain my situation and tell them about the progress I made. I asked if I could be an on call person to prove myself. They told me they would get back to me and have strung me along with that for months. Multiple reach outs later, they don't even bother to respond or tell me I don't have a job. I never received my W2s and when I asked for a copy today over email, I got directed to some website for me to fill out a bunch of stuff to get them. Aren't they required by law to mail my W2s? I was never told I didn't have a job. I was persecuted for mental health reasons, of which I tackled and worked through. I was not properly trained to work with very challenging clients.

Asked Mar 15, 2017 Start implementing pay increases to your field staff. A thank you note or a BAYADA buck is not going to help with higher costs of living. Soon nurses will move elsewhere to other companies offering what you should have offered in the first place to keep up with competitive wages. I do not know anyone who would love to stay working for this company for life with no pay increase! Where is your future going? Come here if you are attending school to better yourself, need part time work while kids are young, are a retired nurse ect. Other then that BAYADA does not have a future for you! Answered May 19, 2020 Start respecting the long term employees. They treat you like you don\u2019t know anything because you were not raised on the computer. If you get the wrong supervisor it\u2019s the worst place in the world to be. These young people come in with no experience and tell you what you do is not right. I\u2019m all for change but they are real jerks about it. If your not they\u2019re friend you end up not being an employee Answered Mar 2, 2020 Is the pay good? Asked Oct 2, 2016 Pay is good for a new nurse with no experience. You will never receive a raise! Do not ask, you will receive the same answer year after year. Smaller home care agencies will give you a yearly raise. Overall not a good place to work for as far as compensation goes Answered May 19, 2020 $9 per hour for CNA in Hickory, NC. Answered Jan 26, 2020 Do you need a car to work here ? Asked May 13, 2016 Yes you drive you tail off Answered Mar 25, 2020 Yes I need a car to. Answered Dec 4, 2019 If you were in charge, what would you do to make BAYADA Home Health Care a better place to work? Asked Mar 21, 2017 Fire all the head staff & get people in who actually care about others. Answered May 21, 2020 The management needs to be educated in how to manage ( not through a bayada class). They need to have backgrounds in healthcare management and not just business. Nurses need to be listened to and respected and not just treated as an easily replaceable entity. They have high turnover rates for RN and there is a huge reason why. Answered Apr 26, 2020 Do they do pre drug screening Asked May 14, 2016 I answered this once, apparently my answer was not used. Again, no, Bayada does not drug test. It is probably cost- prohibitive since they are so thrifty in most all of their dealings with staff. What people do on their own time is their own business. If the client is well-cared for, that is the most important issue. Answered Nov 7, 2019 No and half of their drug addict employees are very irresponsible Answered Aug 14, 2019"
