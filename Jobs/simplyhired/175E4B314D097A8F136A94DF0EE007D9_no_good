Had a love hate relationship with them. Depending on who your fleet manager on depends on how long you stay. I believe when working here, reading in between the lines has to be one of your strong points. ProsHome time options ConsMicromanagement from safety, trucks are extremely underpowered, they were secretive and lack of communication with drivers! 3.0 Regional Driver | Las Vegas, NV | Dec 4, 2014 Great management team and trainers Excellent training , long days, coworkers friendly the weather and the strapping of cargo, most enjoyable part of the job was no one looking over your shoulder 12 hours a day ProsNew trucks ConsNever know when you will be working 4.0 Lead Instructor | Atlanta, GA | Feb 21, 2016 good place to work love working here. They care about there drivers .safety is number one with Roehl transport. Great company to start with and stay with. 3.0 Truck Driver | Marshfield, WI | Feb 19, 2015 Got a good start to truck driving I just started a new career in driving and this was a good start. I am just looking for a job closer to home. I am disappointed in the pay, as in not being paid actual miles, lots of down time waiting to drop off and pick up where you do not get paid for. Prossafety features Conspay, delievery and pick up delays 5.0 Owner Operator Driver | Marshfield, WI | Jun 21, 2019 Friendly employees Roehl is a competitive company that gives equal opertunities to qualified people in the United States. The employees go beyond their way to make your job stress free and enjoyable. 1.0 Relocation Specialist | Marshfield, WI | Oct 1, 2017 Driver Never work here, They fill your head with dreams of making lots of money. After your sixth month you get a .10 per mile raise which is great but they will starve you out or just plain fire you for no reason. They keep the seats warm with new recruits every Monday. BEWARE!!!!!! ProsBig red truck Conseverything else 3.0 Truck Driver Trainer | Marshfield, WI | Apr 27, 2015 Good place to gain experience Typical DAy Recently i Drive for few days and sit for entire day not typical. What I learned: I learned my time has come to move on I already got my experience Management It comes difficult to say we got new terminal and company start building a thicker walls between drivers and rest of so called management. Co-workers are great they got the same goal to earn money Hardest part is to sit with 44 hours left on the clock and you're not earning money because you we're hired to drive I enjoyed being with other drivers because you can get helpful answer from them quicker than calling main or dispatch office ProsGood Starting company ConsAbout 2 years later everything start slowly falling apart 5.0 Staffing Manager | Marshfield, WI | Aug 3, 2015 Roehl is a Progressive Organization Built on Values 11 years ago Roehl Transport had an ad in the paper that said they were searching for former retail managers to join their team to lead and inspire a team of drivers, 11 years ago I responded to that ad and my life has never been the same since! I had no idea what a Fleet Manager was at the time I was hired. Through Roehl's comprehensive training program I was able to learn the basics of the transportation industry and how Roehl uniquely approached the business. During my orientation I learned that Roehl was an organization built of values and that those values are deeply held beliefs beyond compromise. I told my wife that I think I may have found the place that I will retire from! 11 years later I have been able to work in Fleet Management, Customer Service, Driver Recruiting, and Workforce Development. I have relocated twice and I have met and worked with some of the most amazing professionals I have ever met. It is an honor to support the safest drivers in the industry and to work for an organization that has the audacity to actually live the values that it aspires to. ProsRewarding work, opportunities for advancement, unique and challenging opportunities, excellent training, continuing educational opportunities 2.0 Route Driver | Marshfield, WI | Feb 5, 2015 former Dairyland and Dedicated Route driver Horrible pay. You have to fight for home time . Expensive health benefits . The lies just flow out of the entire organization . Sit at customers 4-5 hours waiting to be unloaded . Get to customer , dispatch given already gone, wait 2 hours for them to come up with another dispatch . Wrong pick up numbers always, Drove 2900 miles one week, less than 1000 the following week . In fact the second weeks pay was soooooo bad, I couldn't by a 6 pack and 2 hamburgers with it. The idle time was used fruitfully applying for a new job, which I got. ProsGood equipment 4.0 Tractor Trailer Driver | Marshfield, WI | Oct 4, 2018 Training was good I did the GYCDL program with them in Marshfield, Wisconsin because those types of programs are the only way I could afford truck-driving school. Over The Road training was pretty good, but I failed the 45 degree backing on test-out day for my own truck. Still had the license though, so I was able to get Class B jobs. Questions And Answers about Roehl Transport What tips or advice would you give to someone interviewing at Roehl Transport? Asked Aug 9, 2016 Be punctual. Answered Nov 5, 2019 Yes ask them if they're offering such good benefits and pay why do the require such a lengthy contract? Answered Mar 27, 2019 How long does it take to get hired from start to finish at Roehl Transport? What are the steps along the way? Asked Feb 25, 2016 Its pretty quick. Be weary of the contract they want you to sign. They promise you 1200 a week youll be lucky to GROSS 600 a WEEK thats 7 days. If they paid 1200 a week they probably wouldnt need you to sign a binding contract with them. Answered Mar 27, 2019 Way to fast I was on the toilet when I applied got a call back before I got off of it. A little over 3 weeks later was through orientation and otr training and in my own truck. Answered Feb 25, 2019 What is the interview process like at Roehl Transport? Asked Feb 25, 2016 I was a recruiter and depending upon which recruiter you get (whether one is a favorite amongst the recruiting dept or not) you might get onboard. They are very strict with hiring. Even when you qualify per their guidelines if management sees something on the app they don\u2019t like they will disqualify the driver, period! FM\u2019s also micromanage their drivers and not enough miles. Heard it all the time from drivers I hired there. I never felt confident selling Roehl to drivers due to lack of integrity in the recruiting dept. I\u2019ve been driver recruiting for 3 yrs, 3 different companies and only here at Roehl did I struggle. No support from management at all. Don\u2019t waste your time putting in an app here. Answered Dec 6, 2019 What interview your interview is not crashing into anything at orientation or failing a drug test. If you got all that in the bag congrats you got a job or something like that. Answered Feb 25, 2019 Are there trucks automatic Asked Apr 29, 2017 Big mixture lately a lot of them have been but they just buy what they get a good deal on. Answered Feb 25, 2019 Some, but not for the beginners. Answered Jan 14, 2019 Do you hire people with a past criminal record Asked Apr 28, 2019 Ppl who say they don\u2019t are stupide my felony is 12 years old I was able to go through there training get my cdl and I still currently drive for them Answered Jan 17, 2020 Heck, no I know are liars they may hire you if you already have your CDL, but they told me I can't go to there paid training if I ever was convicted as an felon so I went elsewhere to get my license.
