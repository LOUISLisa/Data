I\u2019d input, into a database that I created, the jobs that each mechanic performed in order to rotate their jobs from night to night. I would go over the flight schedules of each of the 48 DC-10\u2019s in United\u2019s fleet to make sure they were scheduled into Chicago for their timed overnight maintenance check. I would contact United\u2019s scheduling controllers to make schedule changes when necessary. Go through engineering notes and FAA notes in order to make sure our maintenance check was current with engineering changes and FAA mandates. Often I would go to the engineering department to clarify changes made to the DC-10 that impacted our check. I added new procedures into the maintenance manuals, and purged out of date materials throughout United\u2019s O\u2019Hare aircraft maintenance facilities. I ordered parts and tooling if there were special assigned tasks due beyond our regularly scheduled tasks. On occasion, I would escort the FAA through United\u2019s O\u2019Hare facilities. At the end of my day I would set up the paperwork and assign the maintenances tasks to the 48 union mechanics that worked for me. I learned how to work with internal and external customers, multitask, and work with a variety of different people. The manager\u2019s in Aircraft Maintenance changed several times while I worked there. Some were great some were horrible; morale fluctuated based on who was in ...more Prosflight benefits Consi was often overlooked when raises were handed out, often felt resentment for being a female in aircraft maintenance 3.0 Flight Attendant | Washington, DC | Jan 4, 2015 Flexibility Working as a flight attendant was interesting. I wanted to travel and take a couple months after graduation to clear my head and make money while I tried to gain a focus for what I was looking for in life after graduation. Months of not knowing what day it was, what time it was, or where I was, but getting up and working 14-16 hour shifts but only being \"on the clock\" for 5 or 6, taught me that if you are going to dedicate your life to a career, you must have your heart in it. I did enjoy working with the various crews, serving people and meeting all types of different personalities every day, but not being able to maintain a regular exercise and health routine was what killed the idea for me. I did learn how to be flexible as the first two months working I was on reserve, which meant that I had to be at the airport or at home, basically waiting for them to tell me where I would be going that day, or even for the next 5 days, so we had to make sure to be ready for anything at all times. I learned to adapt to living with 16 people at what the airline industry calls a \"crash pad\" where pilots and flight attendants cram together in a hotel room or house so they can have a cheap place to sleep on the nights when they are back in their base and have to work the next morning. At this particular airline, we as employees experienced a little more hardship and issues than most of the other ones. I worked at a regional airline, which means that I flew United Jets but I got paid from ...more 4.0 Agent | Honolulu, HI | Jan 13, 2017 Nice! Probably the most fun I've had in a workplace! I loved the fast-pace workings, the fair treating of co-workers and just everything about this job. I love working in wide places. I was probably one of two people to be an inbound agent at the time I joined. An inbound agent looked over all the cargo coming into Hawaii and into our workplace and made sure they were distributed/transferred to the proper places. It was hardest in the mornings because that is when a lot of cargo comes in, but I enjoyed being able to time everything and get them where they need to be; whether it was to be transferred to other places or to be picked up by clients. Morning shifts were also on time limit since produce needed to be checked first before they can be released to clients. This is where I learned how to manage my time and to work with the warehouse guys in order to make sure we get everything scheduled to arrive in our flight. Talking to clients on the phone also grew more pleasant over time due to building their trust that I can get their cargo in and ready before they come to pick it up. This is where I learned to always consider my time and to get things done when no one else could. My boss taught me that if there was something missing, I don't just wait for it to arrive, I should go and look for it. I got to coordinate and befriend a lot of different departments within the cargo world in order to find things missing in our warehouse. My co-workers were amazing and hilarious peo...more Prosholiday lunches, benefits, awesome co-workers, fast-paced, chances to improve and work in different departments, great raises Conswasn't entirely clear about our benefits, missing cargo 4.0 Trainer | Houston, TX | Jul 3, 2012 Flexible with great management, friendly environment So far, United Airlines has been a great place to work. Yes, there are some inconveniences stemming from the United/Continental merger, such as those with migrating Intranet/email/etc systems. And expensive (self-paid, as a contractor) parking! It's also not exactly comfortable or conducive to my working/learning style to share a work space with someone else, but it's understandable that all the other spaces were occupied and we got a decent size space, at least. However, as a contractor, the management directly above has bent over backwards to get everything aligned as fast as they humanly possibly could so that our jobs as contractors could go forth as planned. I was really surprised at how willing they were to help; I've had places just let me flounder around, asking for help over and over, for months. Not to mention, the atmosphere is really relaxed and friendly, but still professional. You can wear jeans (nice ones) any time, if you want (big plus); sodas are only .55 cents (although missing water bottles); it's pretty quiet; everyone seems to like each other or at least get along so it's not tense and stressful; they treat you with respect and appreciate what you have to bring to the table, degree or no degree; and - so far - the people I've met have had pretty darn good senses of humor. I like the people around me and don't hear a lot of badmouthing, and everyone seems ready to pitch in and lend a hand if needed. In addition to management's aid, multiple people on t...more Prosgreat location, friendly environment, great management, flexible, casual dress Consconstant it-based issues, cramped quarters, missing technological necessities, expensive parking 5.0 Senior .NET Developer | Chicago, IL | Aug 19, 2019 Good place to work ï§ Experience in working with ASP .NET MVC and Entity Framework as ORM Mapping tool for Data Access layer. ï§ Extensive experience in Responsive web-based page and site designs using ï§ Experience in using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML 5, XHTML, CSS, Bootstrap Telerik, Kendo Controls, GULP JS, AWS and AJAX framework in creating efficient and interactive Web applications. ï§ Experience in creating dynamic web pages to get faster response time and to obtain partial updates using ASP.NET, Master pages and AJAX framework. ï§ Expertise in developing windows communication foundation services to expose useful functionality to Web users and Developed Web APIS for backend data communication. ï§ Well versed in N-Tier Architecture and Web applications using Windows forms, Web forms and Windows services, SOAP, IIS and XLST. ï§ Worked in Database Design, Development Data migration using SQL Server 2010/2012/2014/2015, MySQL and MS Access. ï§ Expertise in creating SQL objects like Tables, Stored Procedures, Views, Indexes, Triggers, Cursors, User defined data types and Functions using SQL. ï§ Excellent knowledge of Object-Oriented Design Patterns and Model View Controller (MVC). ï§ Hands-on experience with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and Reporting Services (SSRS) packages for import and export of data for creating reports for Business users and Management. ï§ Experienced at using Subversion (SVN), Visual Source Safe (VSS) and Team Foundation Server (TFS) for integration, code securit...more 3.0 Customer Service Representative | Oklahoma City, OK | May 9, 2019 High stress, demanding, cut throat, wear and tears the body Union gives false sense of security.

A typical day would involve a few business, IT and other cross functional meetings to discuss business needs, update of work on hand, and upcoming up strategic work. It also included building presentations, business and technical documentation and discussions with peers. I have learned a lot at United working with several large divisions over almost 10 years of time. I have led many revenue analyses efforts such as understanding why certain routes were more profitable, why certain markets had more flight delays and cancellations, how the flight network can be routed better, the KPI's to measure performance in each of the different areas of business, why stakeholder engagement is very critical to a project success, end to end application development and the critical role a Business Analyst plays with that, importance of data knowledge and business intelligence and much more. I have had the best managers in my tenure at United. They have been great leaders who were role models too. They built, trust and respect with the team and always put the company's best interest before theirs. The hardest part of the job was the long commute to work The most enjoyable part of the job was the team and the exciting work and not to undermine the perks to fly anywhere on United Airlines Many of my co-workers were experts at what they did and strongly believed in being respectful of each other and kept the team morale up in man...more ProsTravel benefits, co-workers, work with never a dull moment Consconstant restructuing and reorganization that led to loss of productivity, workforce disengagement and a constant change of culture 1.0 Aircraft Maintenance Technician | Dallas-Fort Worth, TX | Jul 31, 2019 Sucks like a vacuum I wanted to achieve the same thing as anyone else, have a good job,one that mattered,with responsibility,and technical awareness. As an Aircraft Technician,I felt I achieved it at Continental Airlines,it wasn't always a bed of roses,But some how,the atmosphere was one of a\" Job Well Done\" Since the Merger with United Airlines,or whatever you want to call it. Everything changed! Of course I can only respond to my experience. Management had \"fear in their eyes\" The airline is run from Chicago... Literally! Nothing is really done or completed,and signed off without the approval of some dude sitting in a chair, in an office, a thousand miles away! And that was my experience. The brotherhood of technicians is also gone. But when you're merging two different technician unions, two different companies,with maybe ten thousand people, your bound to have problems, Seniority! With the last United contract,they can evidently be off the job a literal lifetime?, because of layoff,and come back holding all their seniority,but not the knowledge or experience on aircraft of this age,the New Gen age and newer and hold and a day shift job...very dangerous,my opinion. Work at the fair grounds for 30yrs, and then bump a technician out who is a very competent man,not me of course, But United will pay to retrain them! But hey, I think that is in the guidelines of their contract,I can't really speak of that,Freeze the pension again, I can about that...I'm out! But I'm not bitter! 28 years, an...more ProsYou get paid.

This career is for those of you who may be hesitant to give up your 9 to 5 shift. If you can get past the first couple years, this career may be for you! I was a tad bit older than some of my colleagues and joined the team at age 30. There is no typical day at work because our schedules are always changing due to base operations. During the first 2 years I was on reserve which is the most challenging experience due to lack of sleep and being subjected to drafting. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the term reserve, this is basically the requirement to be contacted during a 24-hour period and your commitment to make it to a flight within a 3-hour period. There is light at the end of the tunnel once you become a line holder. The most satisfying part of the job is the flexibility in scheduling and the compensation. Although I DO NOT AGREE with our newly designed uniforms, I will do what I have to do to keep enjoying my job (I'm applying for a part-time counseling career to maintain my professionalism). I regret to publicly humiliate the executive decision in uniforms but many of us feel like a mockery wearing unprofessional clothing. Many of us possess higher education and post graduate degrees and find this unstandardized per traditional aviation professionalism. We are treated more than fairly in terms of compensation, travel benefits, and medical care.

A typical day is stresses even in your lunch, you can't go outside of the building only can spend time in the cafeteria (lunch). If you say something about the preferences they look to you like a bad boy w/bad attitude (leader and managers) . HR knows this but they don't do nothing cause they are friends. Learn...nothing The managers and the leaders are very lazy and have bad attitude with the associates. The manager of the managers can't tell you good morning when is close to you every day, in the meetings she's rude, has preferences for any reason isn't what you expecting. The hardest part of the job: BAD PAY, management and growing opportunities bad too. No flexible schedule. You can fly...technically but is lie cause you don't have time...need to work and when you can fly you don't have money to spend. People with 10+ years like a employee only earn $11 h.
