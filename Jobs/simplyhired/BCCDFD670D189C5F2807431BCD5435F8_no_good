If you like to work long hours, this place is for you. Typical days are often 15-16 hours, with no regular scheduled breaks, (I usually squeezed in 20 minutes here, 30 there) at least 6 days per week. The pay is abysmal, benefits include room and board and medical reimbursements if you're lucky. If you're struggling with alcohol, don't apply, part of your job is to entertain guests at the bar, and they WILL offer you free drinks, and it is impolite to refuse. I learned how to interact with people from all around the world in informal settings. When you sit down to dinner with a family from Brazil one week, then a family from Germany the next, you really begin to realize that no matter the superficial differences of language, skin color, or place of origin, all people are essentially the same. Co-workers are an interesting bunch with diverse backgrounds and fantastic stories. It will be hard not to make close friends, even significant others. Unfortunately, the company moves people around faster than chess pieces, so your best friend for the past two months might get shipped out to a resort 2000 miles away with 48 hours' notice. Management is hit-or-miss. The higher-ups in the resort, the folks that have been with the company for 10 years or more, are excellent and know what they are doing. They are the ones who make you feel a part of something wonderful. However, most of the Chiefs of Service (middle management) seem pushed to their breaking point, especia...more 1.0 Technician | Sandpiper, FL | Aug 25, 2019 Deceptive and misleading job postings The only reason that I took the time to apply and interview with Club Med is because the specific Indeed job posting listed the compensation as 35-40K. I believe this was an intention fabrication in order to generate online interest and draw applicants to their \"business\". After wasting several days of my time to obtain a video chat (FaceTime) interview with an official Recruiter, I eventually learned that the listed compensation numbers where not only false, but grossly out of line with market reality. I was offered a six day a week, 12-16 hour day, highly technical and demanding position, for a salary of $1000.00 per month. A rate that represented less than a third of the posted compensation, and if accepted would have had me \"earning\" between $2.60 and $3.47 per hour on average. I believe this company purposely seeks a staff of largely inexperienced and youthful interns as opposed to hiring regular employees. This is a business model that smacks of exploitation and is designed to retain profits while obtaining a powerless and expendable workforce. Club Med is worth $1.6 Billion, and it's parent company generates $16.4 Billion in revenue, with $93.1 Billion in assets, with profits around $2 Billion. It is more than probable that their questionable employment practices have more to do with their financial success than their all inclusive resort offerings, and their guest's patronage. I do not doubt that internationally this company provides workers with earning poss...more ProsGives children a place to live and a sandwich ConsSee Review 5.0 General Manager | Woodland Hills, CA | Jan 16, 2014 Professional and friendly workplace with a great staff performing a much needed service for customers. A typical day at work started with me setting up the store for the day and making sure everything was clean and stocked. Once we had the store open I would make sure all customer information had been imputed and updated. Throughout the day I would keep inventory stocked while helping customers find exactly what they needed as well as educating them on the product. Before I left the store I would do a full inventory count and would order more if necessary. My staff was just a pleasure to work with, really friendly people who were knowledgeable about the products in the store. The staff and I were always learning new things having to keep up with the advancements in the medical industry. The hardest part of my job was hearing some of our customers personal problems with loved ones and their own medical issues. The only other difficulties were making sure all employees were happy with their schedules while trying to also make sure it didn't interrupt with their school schedules or personal life. Definitely the most satisfaction I receive from working here is helping out customers to find the perfect things to help them with their medical issues. I absolutely loved it when a customer would come back and tell me how much I helped them by educating them on the products and finding them the perfect one. ProsWas so close to alot of very great resturantes and was a very relaxing inviroment. ConsReally had no time for a break or even to eat your lunch, just had to push thru the day. 2.0 Translator | Port Saint Lucie, FL | Dec 19, 2017 Great communication with guests Being the main source of information for French speaking guests was quite gratifying. As a long time resident of Port St Lucie, I was able to inform and assist guests with their excursions, focusing on the local area as well as Miami and Orlando. The most enjoyable part of the job was to help the guests choose their excursions, translate for them regarding all aspects of their vacation and provide them with an above and beyond customer service experience. A typical day at work consisted of welcoming all the guests, informing them of all the excursions and rates. Assisting with the translation of website, responding to all inquiries, setting up the transportation, contacting guides, airboat captain, boat rides. Staying up to date on all the events in the area as well as translation of all material relevant to the excursions office. Accounting of all sales, daily reports, maintaining all information on an excel spreadsheet used for all sales, communications with guests and contractors. I was also responsible for the training of new employees with a strong emphasis on organization and excellent customer service skills. Multitasking was a key element of the job as well as anticipating all the guests desires. The hardest part of the job was the numerous changes in ownership of the excursions office which created a lack of stability. ProsFrench speaking, using my language as an asset ConsNo healthcare, 401k ... 3.0 Dishwasher | Fort Pierce, FL | Jul 23, 2016 very interactive work place also very team friendly My daily duties here consisted of tending to well over 800 guest a day along with seating them ,removing dishes from tables , assisting them with what ever it was that they needed, and to smile while doing it :). I was also required to gather and place all the utensils and materials needed to set up both lunch and dinner tables in a timed period. During the serving ,resetting and or bussing task we were also required a separate task as well everyday. Weather it was keeping ice inside the soda machine cleaning the runner stations or making sure the whole restaurant(1000 seats total) had water pitchers out and ready it was your daily responsibility. before i was a server i was a steward. There it was my responsibility to have the dishes washed and ready conveyor belt style. This job also had janitorial requirements of keeping the building clean and sanitized In my opinion the management was poor due to not having enough team members on the floor during events, managers comming and leaving, not being prepared for large groups until they came, and overall planning. However these slight downfalls were enough to motivate me to try harder and to do what needs to be done. Prosfree lunch, wide vareity of people, tips Conspoor manegment 3.0 Line Cook | Island, KY | Jan 22, 2013 Party Island For those of you that can work while being intoxicated for the last 24 hours, I applaud you. However, that's not something I want to do, I seperate work from play, and always understand who my bosses are. On this island, it's not so easy to do that. I was the only \"serious\" cook in the kitchen. I never showed up to work drunk or haven't slept yet, nor have I ever not performed my duties to the best of my abilities. Yet, this 'resort' was all about fun and games. Each night, there are new guests coming and going and all they see is parties when they leave, and parties when they came. Not to say that I'm a drab, but I could not keep up with the parties and the entertainment like my co-workers. Management's job was to keep the guest entertained and to make sure the employees were entertaining them. Because it's such an exotic location, the flight cost a lot, and they provide housing, the monthly salary was a mere $1234.00 for six days of work, at 10 hours days. I would not go back to Party Island. Proscaribbean sea, turquois water and white sand everyday, all the booze you can drink Consno professionalism, hedonistic values 4.0 Event Manager | Many, LA | Aug 31, 2013 Amazing experience meeting and working with people all over the world The past 6 years I have been working for Club Med. What was suppose to only be a 6month getaway turned into 6 years of life long lasting experiences I will never forget. I worked in over 8 different countries and learned about other languages and cultures. I managed the Events team as well as the Sports team which was a great experience. The unique this about this All Inclusive Resort is that the staff got to engage with all the guests. The concept was for us to eat meals with them throughout the day and of course entertain them at night with different shows. It is truly one of a kind and to be a part of such an amazing organization has made me open my eyes to anything and everything. This is a great company and I will never forget my 6 years with this company that has made me who I am today. I look forward to sharing my experiences with Club Med and the Skills I have learned and bring it to my next adventure in life. ProsFree room and board, free food, free drinks, health benefits Conslong hours 3.0 Traffic Manager | Port Saint Lucie, FL | Jun 9, 2014 Bitter Sweet place to work If you are between the age of 21-30 this is a great escape from reality. It's as if your on an Island and nothing else matters. The job of a GO starts the moment you leave the Employee quarters and end when you return. Most day start at 7:30 am and do not end until 10:30 - 11 pm. Of course you have your two meal breaks during the day but you are responsible to wake up early enough for your first meal. You get to interact with the guest and join them for meals. It's a really laid back feel but do not think you are on vacation with activities you must participate in all day you do not have time to relax. From Kids activities to dance shows to hosting poker tournaments to dancing the night away with the guests. Your job is a social entertainer and only objective \"is to make the people dreaming\" - Lionel Pirotte, CDV. ProsRoom and Board included plus fitness classes and Circus Lessons. Great Experience ConsShort breaks, only one day off, low pay, and some other things 4.0 Human Resources Manager | San Salvador, PR | Aug 7, 2013 challenges because Club Med has a culture all its own Tour of the Club each morning ensure various departments up to par. Handle employee/management concerns. Dealt with expatriate payroll separate from line staff payroll and benefits. Enforce organizational policies for both segments Daily interaction with guests and GOs. Lunch and Dinners. Participated in all aspects of Club life. Along with staff promoted Bahamian cultural events. Seminars and employee awards. Worked with a variety of people from cultures all over the world which was very interesting and rewarding. Formed lasting friendships. Also was forced to hire persons from various family islands which added diversity to the team on many levels. Most of the time spent at the Club not much time for personal life. However, not a major problem. ProsPosition guaranteed three meals a day and opportunity to attend Club guests functions ConsDemands on personal time was great 2.0 Line Cook | Sandpiper, FL | Sep 22, 2018 Enviornment is off center! Its a great place to work if you work in any department other than the kitchen. As a part of the kitchen staff you work so much all you have time to do is your job. You dont get to socialize with other departments unless you insert yourself and even then most times they are cliqued up. There is a college feel in the ployee building where theres drinking and partying a lot. The kitchen has poor management and the food choices are sub par, not at all what you would expect to come out of the club med brand. There is no creativity and/or effort with the menu and sometimes the management is too rigid to allow any sort of change. ProsWeekly housekeeping, room and board, discount on on-site activities, discount at store and spa, access to the gym and workout classes ConsOne day off, poor managment, you have to pay for the housekeeping you didbt even ask for.
