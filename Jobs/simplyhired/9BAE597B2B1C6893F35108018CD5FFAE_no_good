All that glitters isn't gold This is the most unorganized place I have ever worked with a high turn over in the call center. They keep a consistent new class going do to turn over. At other times they will have a hiring freeze and remain under staffed. The pay is not enough. Promotions are based on favoritism in many cases. I worked offline but still had to cover all departments due to other departments were under staffed. The employees that I worked with were great. The system problems are a major issue that keep you from being efficient. When month end comes this often causes bottlenecks in the systems. I was there for 4 years. It was a major red flag when trainers and Supervisor that have been there for years are quitting . The company doesn't do it self any favors by not sticking to the policies they set but later bend the rules too much for there consultants. There is terrible work life balance. Be pared to work one Saturday a month which is not so terrible but the operations stay open til midnight on the last day of the month which may interfere with you be off on Sundays if the last day falls on a Sunday. You will be required to work on a Sunday. You will also have to work on certain federal holidays that they don't observe. They have recently changed there hours of operation to close at 10 CST. If you are new be prepared to be on that shift. The shift bids are currently based on seniority but it is sometimes based on productivity. If you are not in an offline posi...more Prosteams work well together ConsNo work-life balance, you do not get to enjoy the company perks that the headquarters freely enjoy, They have a better work-life balance 5.0 District Manager | Traverse City, MI | Dec 22, 2014 Challenging and rewarding company, with great training and support. I was able to go to medical school and work another job at the same time as working for Arbonne. They make it easy to work into the \"nooks and crannies\" of your day. I fully back the company and their products. They give outstanding training, support, benefits, and customer service. I would say that \"your\" immediate management and how they portray the companies guidelines really can make or break your experience. Unfortunately with this company you really have to do your research before just jumping in. If the Independent consultant you are starting with is truly following Arbonne's guidelines, you are sure to enjoy your experience. So far 95% of the people I have worked with and encountered have been not only enjoyable, influential and helpful, but have been life changing. The hardest part of working for this company is occasionally dealing with difficult customers/clients, as in any sales related job and dealing with people who are looking for get rich quick schemes. If you are willing to learn and step slightly outside your comfort zone with a committed crystal clear vision of what you want, then you will absolutely become successful in this business. The best part of working for them, is that I can work it into my life and the AMAZING product and people you get to work with. Even if I ever decided to quit, which I don't plan on, I know that the relationships and skills I have obtained will follow me through the rest of my life and flow into other endeavors. 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Addison, TX | Jun 1, 2020 Never work for a place where your questions can\u2019t be answered The trainer was favored by the management staff , which was a negative thing. This meant that your questions, input and voice, would be null and void There was also obvious inside favoritism displayed on day one and throughout the training. 2 students had returned to work there and were called on for everything .There is obvious inside favoritism displayed throughout the training class. The actual trainer wasn\u2019t receptive to questions nor did he take time to listen. The actual trainer wasn\u2019t receptive to questions, nor did he take the time to listen to pertinent issues regarding the system, wording or over all process steps. He made a point of saying \u201ddon\u2019t worry about it we can come back to that later \u201c. When asked about it later, he acted as though you were bothering him and if he did answer the question, he didn\u2019t give a detailed answer. He rushed thru it as if he was mad and said, I\u2019ve got to get thru this training quickly. I was completely confused because throughout the class, he allowed the students to talk about smoking blunts, drinking and places that would deliver alcohol and he had time to engage in those unprofessional discussions but not enough time for training conversations. I thought the whole purpose for the training was to be TRAINED ! I\u2019m sorry I ever applied with this company. 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Punta Gorda, FL | Sep 21, 2015 It was very interesting to meet people all over the United States and Canada. A typical day at Arbonne was answering numerous phone calls from Arbonne consultants through my headset on the computer. They were independent business owners and would call for many different reasons. My job was to educate them as much as possible. On March 1st, 2015, Arbonne launched a new computer program that had many glitches in it. We only had one week of training, so I learned a lot on my own time. I didn't mind because I love people and wanted to do a good job. The management team changed around quite a bit, so I was not sure who did what by May 2015. My co-workers were great!! We all understood that we were in this together and helped each other out as much as we could. The hardest part of my job was not being able to help the customer because of all the glitches in the system. We were told to tell the customers that our computer was in the middle of a system update when errors popped up on our program. The most enjoyable part of my job was the Arbonne consultants themselves. I am a people lover and met so many different people throughout the United States and Canada. They have wonderful products that I believe in. I just wish they had a better computer system. ProsI worked from home. ConsThey never give raises unless you get promoted. 5.0 Independent Consultant | Hilton Head Island, SC | Mar 14, 2017 Best opportunity Arbonne is a company that has been around for 35 years, was started in Switzerland and still adheres to EU standards in heath and wellness. This is a fantastic opportunity to earn extra income while working your regular job, at least or a while, until you get to the higher levels of management. The mentorship in the company is superb, leadership of not only the CEO but the comradery is phenomenal. You are encouraged to work at your own pace, never pushed or stressed, it is completely a self driven opportunity where you get to be your own boss, own your own business with all the perks and jog if you want to jog with it or sprint if you want to get to the top fast. The perks of sales are amazing and the charitable foundation does amazing work. The products - plant based, vegan, gluten free, cruelty free, never tested on animals, combined with safe science, globally expanding because of their benefitial qualities are by far supersceding any lead brands in stores, as the direct marketing approach can use the funds most brands use for overhead, for research and development. Customer service is excellent, and the company standards are high class, high efficiency and the highest quality. 4.0 Operations Associate | Irvine, CA | Oct 21, 2013 A day of work. \u2022 Analyze shipping method (ready orders vs. container space) and destination \u2022 Confirm shipments with factory and provide instructions to freight forwarder \u2022 Track shipments, obtain shipping documents and maintain Container Tracking Reports \u2022 Monitor arrival/clearance of shipments and notify account coordinator \u2022 Coordinate delivery of shipments \u2022 Resolve any issues such as damage, receipt of incorrect product, short ships, etc. with receiving warehouse, factory and account coordinator \u2022 Review/Approve freight bills \u2022 Review incoming container rates and source freight forwarders \u2022 Assist account coordinator and sales specialists with lead time questions and import schedules My co-workers are fun to work with and work well as a team. the most enjoyable part of my day at work is going to meeting to go over the saving that each dept has come up with for the month. Aver day I work on trying to learning new thing by working with other dept on what they are doing. The Management team that i work with is go with working close with us on what they company is doing. ProsWork well with family needs. ConsThe company is not job security place to woek or advancement 3.0 Social and Health Program Consultant | Houston, TX | Jun 16, 2015 Arbonne, International. Health and Wellness Consultant Arbonne, a unique and passionate product. Most will love the many products healthwise and pampering, but the business opportunity could change one's life for the better. One of my favorite quotes, that fit me and the company perfectly. \"The biggest adventure you can ever take is to live the Life of Your Dreams.\" - Oprah Winfrey A typical day at work, some long and some short, were invested. I received great management training and support to succeed lovingly. Our co-workers in teams were always, sharing new ideas to help others to progress. The hardest part of job sometimes was to encourage others to invest in and improve their health, and to pamper one's self. As a dedicated Health Ed professional, I enjoyed teaching people and youth how to improve their overall health and to consider fulfilling passionate business dreams. It was a true blessing to encourage people and myself to seek and improve better overall health with pure, safe beneficial/botanical health, wellness, and beauty products. And also, offer a business option. A blessing presenting Arbonne and having fun doing it. A passion of mine. 4.0 Operations Supervisor | Greenwood, IN | Jan 18, 2018 Fast paced but fun environment Arbonne is a fast-paced distribution center that is an excellent fit for anyone who can multi-task and problem solve simultaneously. <100 associates who are cross-trained to provide support in multiple departments within the operation depending on operational needs keeps the people fresh and out of the \"rut\" that occurs from doing the same thing every day. Management and Corporate keep the atmosphere light even when things get hectic. People are encouraged to have fun when work is slow and expected to \"get it done\" when volume peaks.Enjoyable place to work. Hardest part of the job is end of month operations. 10-12 hour non-stop days for 3-6 days in a row and 1-2 Saturdays per month depending on order volume. The days seem to go by fast, but so do the weeks, then months and before you know it you've been there 5 years. ProsPaid lunches & donuts in the morning on any Saturday worked, product giveaways, Monthly cash drawings, other incentives. ConsLow starting pay for hourly associates limits quality candidates, no accountability for poor performance, \"thats the way we've always done it\" mindset 1.0 Warehouse Worker | Greenwood, IN | Sep 13, 2019 Work near 60 hrs/wk and get refused if you need a day off This USE TO BE a decent place to work...they seemed to care about their employees and rewarded them for hard work and long hours. NOT ANYMORE. They have stopped doing anything that was useful to the employees, no more meals, product, AND they have taken away all holidays, we've worked every holiday this year except 4th of July which nobody could go watch fireworks cuz you had to be in there at 3 A.M. 10 hr days use to be occasional, now it's every day and Saturdays use to be about once/month, now it's every Saturday and even talk of Sundays now too, Nearly impossible to get a weekend off. Working short-handed all the time, not replacing supervisors, letting supervisors sleep on the job and team leads sit around and shop on the company computer. The pay is good for this area but we have no time to enjoy what we've earned. They don't fix issues that concern employees, only management. Not hiring full time help, only temps. ProsMedical, Dental and Vision Ins, 401 K, Life Ins ConsNo work-life balance, no concern for employees 3.0 Independent Consultant | Remote | Dec 6, 2013 Entripreneurial opportunity, Organic Anti Aging Skin and Bodycare Arbonne International products is made from premium botanical ingredients, using innovative scientific discovery, and an unwavering commitment to pure, safe and beneficial products.
