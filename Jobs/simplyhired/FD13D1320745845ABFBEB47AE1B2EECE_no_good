Overall Reviews at Postmates 1.0 Driver | California | May 19, 2019 This company does not care!! Pay in Los Angeles was reduced May 18 and now most deliveries pay around $3 + tips. When I started in 2016 pay was nearly double this. I do well in tips but the new pay model reduces pay by around $1 per delivery. The company actually had the guts to send out an email that was the most insulting, dishonest, and bizarre announcement of a major pay cut I have ever seen. The email stated that delivery payout amounts have been \"updated\" (reduced) in order to create \"transparency\" and to \"better reflect the minimum guarantee\" that drivers receive. The next paragraph stated that this minimum guarantee (the one that is now better reflected) has been removed altogether. I have done 9000 deliveries in 3 years. I started in 2016 averaging around $6.50 + tips per delivery. By last year that was down to around $5.25 + tips, but with the added ability to take multiple deliveries from the same pickup. So I did notice better tips. Now after yesterday's pay cut, I took only 7 deliveries but averaged $4.80 + tips. On 4 of the 7 I got paid $3 and one of those took 25 minutes. I have been working 75 hours a week and averaging a take home of $1100 roughly. I probably sit 10 of those hours as down time so only really work 65 a week. But the new pay scale will likely knock that below 1000 for the same 65 hours. I average spending $100-150 on gas but it is Los Angeles and I would spend close to that commuting to a regular job. Lastly the driver support is intentionally bad. ...more ProsThe pay was actually ok until it changed May 18, 2019 ConsDriver Support, Lack of Transparency with payouts and especially tips, glitchy APP 4.0 Delivery Driver | San Diego, CA | May 29, 2018 My Postmates experience.... When you start out working with Postmates, you will be confused and possibly discouraged by how much you make overall. However, after working part-time (around my career), I found this is to be an excellent way to make extra $. The first 3 months were crazy, because I could not fulfill at least 10 deliveries in an evening because the hot spots only exist in few areas here in San Diego. And those areas are congested and not easy to get to your next destination. However, after these 3 months, I started using the \"Automatic Accept\" through the APP preferences rather than \"Manual\" and found that to improve my earnings greatly! Also, I always like to go above and beyond, so I make sure I am in a good mood so those unfamiliar or unusual issues do not frustrate more. I make sure every order has what it needs and so when I deliver and have any issues, I keep in touch with the customer via text. Fortunately, I receive a tip with about every delivery - 95% of the time. So, right now I'm doing 13-15 deliveries on a Saturday night, beginning at 4:30-5 and ending around 10:30p, making between $120 - $145 (including tips), so it can be exhausting, but in a good way if your attitude is to deliver with excellence. It's all about location with this company, and fortunately San Diego is rich with people who would appreciate you picking up their food so they don't have to drive in congested traffic and seek out their food orders. On the downside, there will be times when only 1 deliver...more 3.0 Independent Contractor | Charlotte, NC | Jan 19, 2019 Delivering in the city of Charlotte I love being my own boss. That's the best part about having a job like this. You make as much money as you want to. I made $103 my first day after my tips within 5 hours of working (which won't show up on your earning until 24 hours after you finish your deliveries). But not everyday is like that. When one app is slow, I switch to another. I also do DoorDash. The thing about these apps, in my opinion, is that you are going to have hiccups. Whether it's app glitches, slow merchants, or confusions of all kinds, it WILL HAPPEN. Be frustrated, but not discouraged. It happens to the best of us. Postmates doesn't do this, but DoorDash give a survey after every delivery. Do it if you can! It will help other Deliverers in the future. Communication is KEY. If an order doesn't make sense, the best thing to do is CALL the customer. If you can't find a location and you can't get a hold of support, call the customer. I've done a lot of research on YouTube and follow the people who choose to make the most of this kind of job. It helps! and I recommend it! My biggest issue with both services, is location. I would prefer not to work uptown because of parking. Either you have to pay for parking or find some spot that's free, which is like looking for a Unicorn with a mermaid sitting on it's back. And also the distances is like, WHAT? sometimes. But there are food deserts in Charlotte (Trust me, I live in a food desert area and it sucks to have to drive so far for good food.),...more ProsAs most people said, I love working by myself for myself (I'm highly allergic to co-workers and bosses) ConsDriving to Grandma's Place and Looking for that Unicorn for Parking Uptown 3.0 Delivery Driver | Dallas, TX | Mar 3, 2019 Make easy money working wherever/whenever 24/7; Dont expect Fleet Support to HELP or explain ANYTHING!!! For 2 years I have been working for Doordash as one of their high rated and dedicated employees, helping them grow to become the company they are today! Even with their minor app flaws, I always keep up with communication between Doordash support, the restaurant, and the customer making sure every issue is resolved while working. I, also, have been working for Lyft for almost 1 year and have had a few hiccups that were easily resolved with Lyft support! I never thought there could be an app that had more problems than Doordash but I was proven wrong! Started working for Postmates 3 weeks ago. In the 1st week, my friend and I accepted an incentive but we were shocked at the results, after successfully completing the 45 deliveries, because we worked our butts off to achieve the goal! Apparently, we did not carefully read the wording for what \"Guarantee Pay\" of $375 meant. We ended up only recieving an extra $107 because the money we made during those deliveries, not including the tips, were part of the $375. So many hours spent killing ourselves, waisted, thinking we would be rewarded with $375. We enjoyed working for them though because we could take out money whenever, work wherever, start in any area, and cancel if the order was too far away. We didnt mind that the tips came in the next day, even if some people didnt tip. We started liking the app more when we, eventually, found Postmates number and could communicate with someone LIVE during an order! Unfortunately, if...more ProsWork any time, anywhere, Fleet help center, LIVE order help, $0.50 transfer of money for unlimited number of times without going offline, shows breakdown of payment per delivery, hot spots given, bonuses/incentives, easy sign up, and free bag with Postmates card mailed!

In essence, they tell everyone that you can get $15+/hour but that rarely if ever works out to be the case as you'd need to do over 2 deliveries an hour and as they don't stack the orders, you're lucky to do one in 35-40 minutes if everything goes smoothly. Typically it goes like this at Postmates: you are waiting in a busy area at dinner-time among other Postmates for jobs (customer orders) to come up on your screen. If a good one turns up, you might not get it bc other guys are faster to accept it and as they show the best jobs to the longer-term Postmates first. If you see a job and accept it, you call the restaurant to place the order. Assuming no problems (not put on hold by restaurant when ordering, everything is in stock, no questions about dressing, sauces, if it should be well-done or medium rare or whatever, etc) that require you to check with the customer, that's like 3 minutes. Takes 20 minutes for food to be prepared, esp at a busy time. I've definitely had longer. Then it takes 15-20 minutes in a good case (no traffic, no rain, can find a parking spot for car or bike) to pick it up, pay for it with these Pex credit cards, get to the apartment building of the customer, and another 5 minutes to have doorman call upstairs, get approval by customer to come up, and for you to go upstairs or the elevator and hand it off (sometimes the customer wants to ask a random question too). Half the t...more ProsYou can take an hour off if you need a break (obviously unpaid) and someone will take your shift Consterrible pay and bad rules 3.0 Driver | San Diego, CA | Feb 6, 2016 Bad experience just make sure you get paid when you are doing postmate you can not get below a 4.7 else you are in danger of getting fired. Most people only rate you when you do bad then when you do good so it is hard to keep a high average. one time postmate gave me a number for a customer and I tried to call the customer and tell them one of there items was not at the store but the number did not work so I had to call postmate in try to get a hold of the customer during this time is running out. so I just get what is there and drop it off. By the time i got to the customers house that is when the help line finally called and I got rated low dropping me to a 4.6 because I was a beginner and did not have a lot of rides to support an average. I am in college so I took a break and then postmate fired because I was not signing to schedule. Then when final where over I went back with a 4.6 rating and they signed me back on. But then after a few I had an order that was schedule to go to Walgreens but i ended up going to a different address to pick up food. When i delivered the food the customer told me he did not have an item and customer support told me to go pick up the item the restaurant forgot and i was going to get paid for just to call once i deliver. I was not on another delivery so i can not find anyway on the app to get back in connect with help support. I emailed them right after it happened and had to ait to the next day I was scheduled to call the help support to ask them if I was going to get paid and...more 2.0 Driver | Boston, MA | Jan 15, 2019 Postmates Delivery Driver Working for Postmates is pretty much like working for other contract positions with companies like Uber Eats, Door Dash, etc. The companies see contract workers as a revolving door of robots who they can easily replace next week, they do not offer any benefits, and they get away with workplace violations such as not paying a minimum wage because their drivers are all considered \"contract\" workers. My main gripe with Postmates is that they have too many drivers for the amount of work available, at least in my city (Boston). Basically, you go online in the app and Postmates will offer you deliveries. At times the deliveries can be one after the other, but there are days where I have been parked in my car for hours waiting for the next delivery to come up. It feels like I'm wasting my time, because I will have been sitting in my car for 4 hours and have made $20 from 3 deliveries. It could be great if you are just trying to pick up some spare change to go to the movies, but planning to survive off of this job would be a huge mistake. If you are going to work for Postmates, know that any time you spend waiting for the next delivery, as well as time spent driving TO pick up the food, will NOT count as time worked. Your pay from Postmates is based off the distance between the restaurant or store and the customer's home. This means you might wait for a job for 20 minutes, spend 20 minutes driving to the restaurant to pick up the order, 10 minutes to drop the order at the customer's ...more ProsFlexible ConsLow pay, no benefits, feels like you're wasting time 1.0 Courier Driver | Los Angeles County, CA | May 9, 2016 LESS THAN MIN WAGE and horrible courier support I DO NOT RECOMMEND POSTMATES as a driver or a client. This is like playing roulette only with your time and your vehicle. The concept is great! Get delivered what ever you want in under an hour. That rocks. However, at what costs? The management is not transparent and does not want to share vital information like what the compensation is, rates, what mileage your actually compensated for on each job. I was once told that we get .11 a min for waiting once a job has started or if we are doing grocery shopping and to have no worries.....SERIOUSLY?!?!!? Basic math can tell anyone that is not even minimum wage, if a job takes you an hour to do! Some jobs I make $4.20 or less and some jobs more....more than 1/2 the customers do not tip which is completely out of my control or maybe they do and we are not given the tips. UCLA, USC and Loyola Marymount students are horrifying to make deliveries to as they almost never tip, waste a bunch of the drivers time, give bad information or directions, insist you park your car illegally to accommodate them and all drivers are responsible for all tickets, parking or moving violations. You have to pay for all gas and car maintenance. They do not provide the IRS rate of .54 per mile. Postmates should offer at least minimum wage! It's the humane thing to do. This job is not a livable wage even if you work as hard as possible and try to do three deliveries an hour which is also unsafe due to time and driving laws. They also do not h...more Prosmake your own schedule ConsNot a transparent co, not a livable wage, no incentives, not minimum wage, bad customer and courier support. 1.0 Delivery Driver | Dallas, TX | Jun 23, 2019 If you enjoy working for less than minimum wage, and damaging your car in the process, Postmates is for you. Let me just lay it out for you, logically. tl;dr: It's not worth it. 1. It is *criminal* how little they pay you. Making between $2 - $5 per delivery with no guaranteed tip is ACTUALLY LESS, once you account for gas (and god forbid, tolls). 2. THE APP IS GLITCHY, from time to time. Occasionally, your payouts don't show up and it leaves you in limbo wondering whether or not you just got paid for the 30 or so minutes you just spent delivering to someone. 3. YOUR VEHICLE IS ONE OF YOUR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS, and Postmates does not care that you are adding mileage to it. In other words, there is no compensation for gas, and no vehicle can run forever. So think about the fact that it will be hard to pay for an: - oil change - tire maintenance - other miscellaneous maintenance - eventual car replacement that will come much much sooner if you spend a lot of time doing Postmates 4. If a delivery is canceled as you're headed to go pick it up, Postmates gives you *nothing*. So even though you just spent perhaps 10 to 20 minutes in traffic (spending your time/gas/mileage) to go get something, they will not pay you a dime. Awful... 5. As all people in the service industry know, people *often leave no tip*.
