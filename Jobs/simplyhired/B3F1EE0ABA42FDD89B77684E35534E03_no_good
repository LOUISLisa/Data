NYWilmington, DEWilmington, NCWinter Park, FLWixom, MIYpsilanti, MI Overall Reviews at Shipt 3.0 Store Shopper | Miami, FL | Apr 23, 2019 Shipt Shopper The pros of Shipt Shopping is that it\u2019s Flexible meaning you can work when you feel like it, and you get paid every Friday, and if you elect to ever use Shipt yourself you get a free membership. However there are plenty of Cons to Shipt all. I\u2019m going to give it too you straight. Some markets are better than others for Shipt meaning you can make more money in some markets over another. All Delivery Orders are $8.00 pay. And Shopping and delivery orders are a percentage of the order which could be anything from $6.00-$14.00 on average depending on the Order but, mostly it\u2019s around $9.00 on average for pay. So pay is extremely low when you calculate the time it takes to Deliver and to Shop for the Order. However the Company sometimes offers something called Promos which Promos are usually $5.00-$50.00 For orders that are at risk of not being taken and close near the delivery time, which means if the company offers $50.00 Promo and the percentage of the Order is $13.00 your total pay is $63.00 for that Order or $63.00 for that one hour because normally most orders can be shipped and delivered within an hour. However $50.00 promos are rare but, $35.00 promos are common. When I first started Shipt someone told me don\u2019t be afraid to take the lower paying order because most people TIP. Some people Tip and the TIPS are Low , Extremely Low most can be anywhere from $5.00-$25.00 but on average most Tip $6.00 to $7.00 is likely. So if someone has Again a $50.00 pro...more 1.0 Store Shopper | Louisville, KY | Apr 30, 2019 Intimidation, Bullying, Territorial, Poor Leadership, Juvenile, Disheartening Coming from a caregiver at heart, someone who has always found service work rewarding, bullying detrimental and too, being a woman who understands how important it is to uplift and empower others \u2014 having to say these very things is hard for me, but it would be harder for me to see anyone else affected in such way simply because I didn\u2019t share an experience that has changed me. Do not, and I repeat, do not become a victim to not only the territorial and self\u2014insecurities of others, but too, be their target simply because they disguise a very nasty character internally. Don\u2019t allow anyone to intimidate you, especially to the point of making you feel emotionally uncomfortable to even walk into your neighborhood marketplace without feeling like you may be hit with yet another false report, nasty look or forced to view a circle of individuals that get rounded up \u201care waved over\u201d for yet again, another self\u2014gratifying style that they\u2019ve developed. It\u2019s rather disheartening. To not only see a select few individual(s) design something similar to, and as juvenile as a buddy system to intimidate but more unfortunate, to watch others join in because of feeling obligated due to whom they\u2019re having to deal with. I\u2019ll give you an idea. Someone who screams \u201cleadership\u201d in your face upon their \u201cforced\u201d first meeting with you because they\u2019ve bombarded, causing a scene, all while CUSTOMERS shop, halting you during your \u201cshop\u201d setting your \u201chour\u201d aside, to give you information upon th...more ProsService work, Customers, Self scheduling ConsSee above. 1.0 Store Shopper | Toledo, OH | Dec 13, 2018 Consistently Inconsistent The one thing I can say about this job is it is consistently inconsistent. In my experience (I just completed my 60th shop, I have a 4.9 average rating, 97% on time, 95% acceptance), this is not a job to rely upon for consistent income. I think this job is best for individuals who want a 2nd job to earn a little spending cash as a side job. Here is my detailed assessment so far (sorry in advance for the long read): The Good: 1. Flexible Hours. 2. If people are generous, you can make between $15-20/hour. 3. Some customers are a pleasure to shop for. 4. You can work at your own pace by scheduling yourself appropriately. 5. You can shop for multiple orders at once, but be careful not to mix orders up (you can merge the shopping lists in the app, but it is easy to mix them up). The Bad: 1. The time estimation that SHIPT uses is typically not accurate. I believe I read they estimate the time it takes to complete an order by using the travel time estimation (distance) to the delivery location (this is the only thing they account for) and they allot 2 minutes per item shop time. So, this does not account for things that frequently happen while out on a shop, such as: a. Working with a customer to find a replacement item when an item is out while on a shop (this happens frequently) and customers are not always responsive to your texts/calls. b. Travel time \u2013 they only calculate the estimated time to deliver from the store, so if you have 2 orders wi...more ProsFlexible ConsAvailable work, pay 2.0 Store Shopper | Chicago, IL | Apr 30, 2020 Challenging and fun at times but mediocrity takes over. Glory days are long gone. Shipt serves as an electronic marketplace for customers to have access to thousands of items delivered within an hour by an independent shopper. Upon applying for the job, it was unique (and fun) to record video \"answers\" to questions related to servicing past clients. Having 7 independent contractor jobs prior, this process was easy as cake. Altogether, it took about 30 minutes to complete and within a few days, I was hired. Few companies have attempted to become the industry standard and I find it amazing how successful Shipt has marked their footprint in a very competitive landscape. As opposed to relying on a centralized hub or DC and over piling hundreds of packages in a van for delivery, retail big box stores serve as supply warehouses for Shipt shoppers to obtain product and individually deliver the magic. Shipt acts as the intermediary handling technical order issues. One major win-win for the shopper is being able to see the entire order, a delivery address, earnings potential, and an estimated completion time prior to accepting. Once getting acquainted with the Shopper app, you appreciate the ability to discover and find unheard-of like items indicated by the aisle, row, and usually identified by a picture. Stacking orders (accepting more than 1 order), shopping from one single store to source product, and conveniently setting time delivery windows are all prime advantages to maximize earnings. Completing as many orders as possible in a given day was the best path t...more 1.0 Store Shopper | Cincinnati, OH | Mar 14, 2018 The Truth about Shipt I want to give you an extremely honest look at Shipt. I will telling the truth about them that they will not tell you, and personally what I have experienced while working there. I did not want to write a review, but I feel I have to tell people the truth, because this company spreads a lot of lies about themselves to the public. Shipt is COMPLETELY UNTRUSTWORTHY. Most of their marketing used to get people to join them will say things about the fact that you can make some good money working for them. The money is small. You will only make good money if you take huge orders, which take a few hours to complete. Even then, it's only around $20. Not everyone tips. If they did, you would get around $15 per order. But they don't. I actually had great customers while working here. But the company did very little to keep me interested. When I started out it was very stressful, because I did not know the Meijer store (this is the store I shopped at in my area) very well at all. Once I got used to it, it got easier. If you have a problem finding items, you can ask associates at the store. Once you know where everything is, it is much easier and faster to shop. SHIPT CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS A JOKE. They have a chat system, which sometimes will not work at all. And when you have a card that has no money on it, meaning you can't pay for your groceries, that is a big problem. I once waited 20 minutes until I got someone on the chat system to fund the card. One day, I tried calling (which is ...more ProsSome people will give you a Tip ConsMost everything, this company wants you to FAIL! 2.0 Store Shopper | Louisville, KY | May 2, 2019 Not Worth It For Me I can't say whether someone should work for them or not as a Shipt Shopper. I think it may depend on you location and other factors. But I would not recommend the job to anyone I know in the same area unless they didn't have another source of income, needed flexibility, or just doesn't mind the pay. Some people also may use it as a temp job until they find something else, or as supplemental income. Others may like their pay and may be in a great area for what this is. Some people I know outside my metro do okay with it, and have their own strategy that makes it worth it for them. The advertisement of $22.00 an hour just isn't true unless you are doubling orders, your order total is high enough, people tip and/or other factors. I have to wonder if customers look online and see that advertised and actually think that is what people make. And we aren't even covering the wear and tear on your car and the fact that you are using your own devices, etc. I think the highest earners have a strategy if the jobs are actually there. Because again, that depends on where you live. The lack of tips is an issue in my opinion if you are just working the position per order without any sort of promo pay or whatever. Getting tips seems to be a thing of hit or miss with some areas where people say they get them all the time. But in some areas they just do not, and it does not matter how great your customer service was either for anyone wanting to play the blame game.

Unpaid and distant travel, Unexpected non-tipping for great service, no gas reimbursement I am brand new to Shipt, and feeling SO discouraged, after being so excited to get hired. As a stay at home parent looking to get back in the workforce, I thought this would be the perfect side hustle, in addition to my pet-sitting. I was happy to invest a good six or so hours in the applying, online training, and the virtual orientation (all unpaid). The app is easy to learn and use. I wasn't expecting this to be a lucrative gig but I have learned quickly that this job pays below the minimum wage (unless you have consistent, generous tips, and are able to deliver nearby). My first night working, I had two local jobs. First customer tipped 20% on a very small and easy order, the next, 5% on a much larger and complex one, but they were nearby. The deliveries were easy to make, but the shopping took much longer than the app estimated, because items were out of stock and I had to ask the customer about substitutions. Further, several of the items requested were not available this late at night: the Seafood case had been wiped clean, and the deli does not slice fresh meat after 8 p.m. The first night l earned a total of $42 for three hours of work, but keep in mind that tax was not taken out, and that I was not paid for the gas. Still, decent for a first day. The next day, I was offered an odd delivery within my area, but I would have to deliver to the middle of downtown (not my area) in the teeth of rush hour. I accepted the order, because you are expected to a...more ProsFlexibility, no boss ConsTerrible pay, no gas reimbursement, no tipping prompt ahead of time 3.0 Store Shopper | Battle Creek, MI | Mar 23, 2018 Not a full time job I started working for Shipt just last week. I did 10 shops, all coming quickly, everyday. I even had to pull myself off the schedule at times because it was overwhelming. I made $200 the first week and was 5 minutes late with only one order (my first day)- but I have a 5 star rating so far and every customer tipped. But I also put 100 miles on my truck delivering. I'm in my second week and have only had 4 shops. $60. With tips. I'm updating my phone, so hopefully that will help. It's been silent for two days now with no orders offered to me strangely enough. I took this job because there aren't decent PT jobs in my area and need something part time to cover the \"disposable income\" we don't have for things like medical deductibles and paying down credit cards. I did not know that you could check an address on the map before accepting an order (which you only have 1 minute to decide). This would have been helpful so that I wouldn't have to drive a half hour across town to shop, then drive a half hour back to my side of town to deliver, to drive all the way back across town to shop again. And some orders are small. Like, they pay $6-7. The pay is actually $5 + 7.5% on the register total. So a $70 order only pays $10.25. You do not get reimbursed for mileage, tho you can claim it at the end of the year. I like the freedom and ease of shopping- once you get the hang of it, it's gravy. However, they give the best rated and the new people first crack at shops.

Shipt is a very flexible gig job that can be satisfying but frequently is not. Customers (members) are capricious in their demands at times and Shipt does not buffer this. One has to be very organized in their shopping and time management to make the deadlines and receive positive reviews which is essential for more shopping jobs. (Due to coronavirus, time deadlines and reviews are suspended and does make shopping easier as much of the pressure is off. However, the customer may suffer if the shopper takes a lackadaisical attitude toward shopping and the member.) Customers at times have no qualms about adding many items on and are sometimes very disappointed if they can't (Shipt should have a maximum add-on quantity - such as 3 to 5). I've had customers ask to deliver items for a child and then sing 'Happy Birthday', or make up a complete Christmas Gift bag with hand written card and wrapping - Oh, and get it there at a specific time. Typically, extra services such as this has an implied generous tip - which typically never comes about. Shipt pay itself is okay if one hustles and shops a quick high dollar ($100+) job but the tips are what makes it. When I left Shipt, tips were declining precipitously to the point that a perfect, on-time delivery, for a tedious $100 order was generally yielding a $5.00 tip (have a pizza guy deliver $100 in pizzas with a $5.00 tip and see how that works...?). (by the way, I had a 4.9 customer rating and 100% on-time delivery.) Speaking with ...more 4.0 Store Shopper | Atlanta, GA | Mar 8, 2017 Fun, flexible, active work, but comes with frustrations Shipt is great if you want complete freedom and flexibility to set your own schedule and work when you want. It's also a fun job that keeps you out and about and active throughout the day. I love shopping orders and seeing the different products people select, and I also like driving around the city, seeing new areas, and meeting the members. For the most part everyone is extremely kind and patient, especially when it comes to substitutions on orders. Most orders are easy enough, and the shopper app helps a ton with organizing your time and shopping in categories. There are some frustrating aspects to this job, however. The most frustrating thing for me is shopping an order and finding that half the items on the list are not in stock or aren't even carried at the particular store the app suggests to me (Shipt take note: this is especially true with frozen foods!). This slows shopping WAY down, as you have to text members about every item not found, and then wait for a response on what they want to do. I think this is frustrating for the members as well, as they aren't in the store and can't see the possible substitutes. Sometimes they ask and it takes forever to respond to them with the other brands/flavors/varieties available. When I show up to someone's door with an incomplete order, I feel bad. I'm now the \"face\" of the company to them, and I'm the person they will blame if they aren't satisfied with what I did/didn't find. And it's completely out of my control if ...more ProsVery flexible, fun & active work ConsPay isn't great, shopping can be frustrating and stressful Questions And Answers about Shipt If you were to leave Shipt, what would be the reason? Asked Mar 29, 2017 To be honest, it's a side hustle that great customer service is expected. I find that the more you communicate with the customer, the higher the tip and in the end pays off. The only reason I would leave, is if demand became low. I've had a positive experience so far and maintained a perfect rating as well as very generous tips. Answered Apr 19, 2020 This guys should learn how to treat their shoppers, there isn't enough resources in the app and you can't even call nor contact them. What company doesn't have customer service? Are you kidding me? They parade themselves that they have customer service, but you will be on hold for almost two hours with no one coming on. There's no cash out option which is very very terrible, so I have to wait until next week to get paid for the job I did today, before I could eat or pay my bills, who does that this time? The management is a complete joke. Someone needs to look into them. Answered Apr 19, 2020 Do you screen the people that is buying the food to make sure the person delivering the groceries lives aren't in danger. Asked Sep 29, 2016 A shopper is not a hired employee.

Answered Jan 28, 2020 So they back ground check and give a extensive interview process to applicants and do nothing to check customer out That's unfair to deliver person ,They're putting them at risk !! . Answered Dec 27, 2019 My friend is very interested but she is vegetarian and even walking past the meat department is difficult for her. Is there any way she could only accept orders from vegetarians? Or is there some other way it could be worked out such as calling ahead for for the meat department to select items and put them in a bag for her? Or she could perhaps arrange to meet at the store with another Shipt person and could pay them to select the meat and put it in a bag? Asked Jan 31, 2018 Seriously? Is this a joke? Um no, don't take the job if you can't do the job. Answered Jun 15, 2019 I would say most of my orders are delivery only and you can decide which orders you take.
