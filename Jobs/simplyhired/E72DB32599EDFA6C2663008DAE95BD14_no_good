I liked the company throughout my work period over there. If given a chance I would like extend my contract with them. 5.0 Warehouse Worker | Dallas, TX | Feb 20, 2017 Productive and fun environment with free snacks Stitch Fix is a great company to work for. They provide free snacks and drinks for employees. The work environment is encouraging and energized. You are allowed to listen to music while you work. ProsFree snacks ConsNot many advancement opportunities 2.0 Packer | Bath, PA | Apr 23, 2019 management was not good Management wasn't good. They gave out rules but didn't listen to them. Favoritism was very big and very unfair. The more work you put it, they didn't care to a person who didn't do their job very badly and just stood around chatting. 5.0 Warehouse Lead | Dallas, TX | Apr 28, 2017 Very fun! It was great to work there. The staff was amazing and so was the employees. Very friendly environment and I will definitely miss this place. The growth and development skills I will take with me in the future! Thanks. 3.0 Customer Specialist | Remote | Mar 31, 2020 Good remote job but not much upward mobility Setting your own daily/weekly schedule and it being a remote position are the best parts of the job. You'll spend all of the hours in your workday styling and checking the occasional email. The company has good communication all the way around. Very focused on your metrics and client feedback. 5.0 Quality Control Supervisor | Dallas, TX | Jul 3, 2019 good working environment, I enjoyed working there and met some good people while I worked there. In receiving where I worked at there was a set goal to but not to hard to achieve. 1.0 Merchandising Specialist | Bethlehem, PA | Jul 7, 2018 Stitch fix is a fake dream If a manager at stitch fix doesn\u2019t like you they will eventually find a way to get you fired. I was fired for no reason and was under high amounts of stress and pregnant. I was a hard worker and did my job better than anyone else and was set up to be fired. ProsNone ConsEverything 2.0 Specialist | Dallas, TX | Apr 7, 2018 Good lower management teams (specialist) No room for advancement, Mangers play entirely to much with the employees and then wanna come and snap on the same employees for not hitting their numbers they claim to not only care about the metrics but its all that's ever brought up they say voice your opinion but when you do your most likely to be walked out ProsFree Snacks ConsTo much favoritism 5.0 Warehouse Supervisor | Dallas, TX | May 19, 2020 Great place to work Great place to work Great work life balance Great work place Great people to work with Most enjoyable part of the job are the people Management is enjoyable 5.0 Stylist | Sacramento, CA | Mar 6, 2020 Great Company They have been a great innovative, growing, kind, hard working company to work with. Their focus on feedback shows. I appreciate that. As a remote stylist, it\u2019s highly focused work on the computer. Creativity and ingenuity and relationship building is paramount in this position.
