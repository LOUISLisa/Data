Representative | United States | Mar 18, 2016 high-stress, overly demanding, unrealistic expectations Here's a summary list of issues I and my former colleagues experienced. (Be prepared, I've written a novel) As a field rep: You have a fixed salary at $30,000 with a $400 vehicle allowance IF you drive more than 800 miles within a month. You must fill out a form documenting your mileage, otherwise your allowance becomes taxed, HEAVILY. Your job is comparable to most other B2B sales jobs. 1) Wake up almost unreasonably early and drive around town soliciting construction outfits trying to sell them labor support that's far more expensive than competitors with the stipulation that Tradesmen labor is also far superior in skill and demeanor. The truth is, Tradesmen hires from the same local pool that competitors hire from, so the labor is identical. In fact, I've worked with field employees (as they're called) that bounce between one staffing agency to another looking for work. The issue in this is that you're selling an unstable, unreliable product most of the time. Whether they show up to work, perform adequately or even know how to do the work is entirely a mystery. Vetting candidates is a difficult task, as Tradesmen cannot perform practical testing to gauge trade skill and comprehension. When a field employee is found to be unreliable or unprofessional, it becomes your job to throw another warm body on site until you get the right fit. It was more or less equivalent to throwing gas drenched timber on a fire.

Most of this is for the California market because that is where I worked. Compensation: Base pay is 30-40k per year + commission. Management will tell you can make 100K with their \u201crobust\u201d commission structure within a year. (They just lowered the commission rate it this year.) This is simply false. Only the top 10% of reps in this company make over 100K per year and none of them are in California. More than half of the reps in this company never break 50K per year. I knew one of the top rep in the Southern California market and he barely made 65K. Expect to work 55-60 hours a week. Goals are set out of thin air by the Area manager. My goal was the same as the goal of our whole office which encompassed 5 territories of which I only had one. .My goal was also 4 times what is was the previous year. When I questions how the goals were determined all I got was from the area manager was he determined the goals. He said it was not based on last years sales, projections or anything else. Just what \"he thought\" was a proper goal. This from a man that supposedly has an MBA. Very Poor Product: Tradesmen International business is Labor Support. We would provide carpenters plumbers and electricians help contractors improve there work flow and increase productivity. They say they have \u201cQuality Craftsman\u201d to accomplish this.

Being that the GM is a formal salesman this (later on) is not surprising. Be prepared to be belittled, talked down to, and have office morale depend solely on what kind of mood said GM shows up to work that day in. Be prepared to be made to feel dumb when asking a question with constant phrases like \"like I just said\" or \"it says it RIGHT THERE\" or \"we just talked about this in yesterday's meeting\" or \"it shouldn't be that hard\" or \"it must be user error\" or \"this wasn't an issue when so-and-so was here.\" These are all from memory. Sadly, I have an actual list I'll be reporting to HR very soon and the list of these types of phrases goes on and on. The sales reps waste no time at warning you that what you're told in the interview process is far from the experience you'll have. It only takes a few days to hear the chatter or be given specific examples. Nobody is happy. If hired as a rep be prepared to be micromanaged. If hired as a \"secretary\" as he likes to call it - be ready to asked to do things that aren't your job and get yelled at if they aren't done in the specific way dictated. This includes being told to harass clients and field employees alike as you are expected to call and/or email over and over (this means ALL DAY) or until management is satisfied. This also includes being told to attempt to micromanage other offices and even corporate.

I've been an admin for 3 years for this company, I have always been part time (30-35 hours a week) and when I first started I got paid holidays, sick pay, vacation etc. They took that away about a year ago. Now they have switched everything to Electronic timecards, employee does not have a choice in the matter you MUST have a device new enough to run chrome and input your hours electronically, then it's supposed to be emailed to the company supervisor. So if the supervisor forgets to approve it like many construction workers supervisors arent super into technology either... too bad. Its somehow my fault. It's my fault when grown men dont turn in their timecard. Somehow all this stuff I have no control over is my fault. They also started doing electronic invoicing, so the client can not respond to the email (if they even get the invoice at all) and corporate is too lazy to send timecards. So we have a handful of people at corporate processing all the timecards and invoicing for thousands and thousands of employees and clients. There has been nothing but issues so far from employee and client perspective. I'm getting yelled at daily over things I have no control over. I cant even print out a basic list of the timecards that were processed or the invoice count. I'd have to search through 300+ clients just to see if anyone worked there or not.

I was offered a solid wage that had changed 2 days after my first check. the job I did was basically a lackey and got ZERO experience in the job scope I was offered. basically, its a contractor job were you'll do either clean up or some building. I worked with 4 different companies in the first 3 weeks I was there. the rules changed several times during the 3 months I was there. I had to force quit the first one because of the person I was working with was unruly, refused to sign this paper saying that I was there so I could get paid.. I literally worked 2 hours for free since he refused and there was no logical way of proving it. the last job I was at before I quit all together was so full deceitful people that it was pretty much a sick joke. I missed 1(one) day, I got be-raided for it even after showing the manager my viable cause for absence. he degraded me because of it saying 'I cant have you punk a** kids in my company showing when ever you d*** well please\".. I walked out right after that and went back to my manager at tradesmen and asked for other work. I never heard back from him so I took my 20 dollar pay check and went home. the biggest, and more unusual thing that I had to do was call in EVERY single day to see if I was working. it made no sense. it's like 'how am I supposed to have a normal life\" I was the offered to go to Chicago to help do renova...more Prostravel Conston of cons 5.0 Apprentice Electrician | La Mirada, CA | Nov 26, 2018 So here's my only thing Tradesmen pays way better than most companies especially if you're a journeyman and you want to work on a prevailing wage job site, You make like 76/hr. however as apprentices go. every job wants you to work fast, and these clients lie to tradesmen and claim that the job is for 3 months, which just isn't true. the hard part which they give to us, normally rough in would take their guys 3 months to complete normally takes us 3 weeks to complete. if we go slower, we get kicked off the site, when we work hard and go fast, they kick us off the site upon first inspection after rough in is complete. I've worked with many companies and it's always the same thing. The longest I was there at a single site by one client was 4-5 months and that was great. the reason they constantly let us go is whatever you're getting paid, tradesmen charges that company twice as much at least and every single foreman thinks that they can save money if they just get their guys to do the job but they fail to see that if they just paid their guys a fair living wage that they could get the top guys to do the work to begin with and not have to overpay to start. Tradesmen has perks like discounts on movie tickets, airfare, hotel and more, they give you the option of full benefits which is great but the highest a apprentice can get paid is $25/hr which is for like 4th/5th year apprentices. that is barely enough to survive on the coast.

You're going to end up being a salesman (deliver 4 new clients a month signed on), managing multiple employees on jobsites, projects, end up taking care of pay issues, HR stuff because they're too cheap to hire anyone for that. With the amount of extreme turnover here, a lot will fall on you. If you fall behind on any of these \"responsibilities\", expect to get harassed and booted. It's chaotic and there's not much job security here. Horrible Marketing- claim to be $500M and growing, but nobody has ever heard of them before... Long Hours- expect to be at it 6am-9pm between walkouts (where you accompany tradesworkers to jobsites first day), driving around prospecting, being on the phone dealing with all sorts of issues, 3pm \"mandatory\" meetings, and all kinds of nonsense. You'll burn out fast. My head was throbbing 5 days a week, and then the phone doesn't stop ringing on weekends either. With that much headache, you'd make 10x more running your own business. Moody Upper Management- This one you'd have to experience first hand. It's quite comical sometimes. Our office GM basically told us he's already well off and only there because he loves construction.

I use the term skilled tradesmen very loosely. Management presents this company as if they are the leader in skilled trades but that couldn't be farther from the truth. These people will hire almost anyone with a pulse regardless of work ethic and skill set. You will see anyone from 18 year old kids to people well in their 60's. Very rarely will they have any type of work for you to do in your actual field or skill set and sell you out as a general labor for a low wage. They are more concerned with the quantity of workers on their sites as opposed to the quality. People can call off, have criminal records, be evident drug users and show up when they feel like with no repercussions. They also promise full time employment which usually ends up being about 20-30 hour weeks if you're lucky so don't worry about not having free time. Another terrible part of this company is the wages. You will have workers making $18 an hour while another worker can be making $12 even though they're doing the same work with the same level of experience. Its all about how much money they want in their pockets. They also present jobs they find you as a great wage even though you make about 45-60% of what the client is actually paying for the position.

You will work independently for the most part without any real training other than some sad company training videos you watch the first few days. Then you are out and selling the big push is to get new customers to sign up but you don't get paid anything for signing a new customer up. You only earn 6% commission on gross profit for the first 20k a Week in sales and once you hit 30k a week it bumps up to 16% but do the math on that and realize that right now out of the 100 sales reps I can see on the report only 15-20 hit this number in a given week. You lose 25% of your commission if the customer pays any more than 30days after the work week is done even if Tradesmen doesn't send out the invoice for 25 days and you also have no AR visibility to speak of so you don't even really know what's going on unless you dig into the software since they don't train you on it other than providing your log in information. You will have a daily sales meeting at your office whether you are in the area or not and it's at 3 pm so figure on being in your office until close every day even if you started work at 4 am (and you will).
