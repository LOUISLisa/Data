They have people quitting their career in the military reserves because they REFUSE to support them continuing to perform their 2 weeks a year of reserve drill. Also, they fail to actually follow through on the book they claim is part of their sales management philosophy, 'Mindset: The new psychology of success'...they actually just fire people forcefully, not develop them further, if they struggle after being hired. ProsCompensation, Branding ConsManagement support, leadership philosophy, follow-through 4.0 IT Analyst | Stamford, CT | Oct 8, 2019 Great people to work with Even though benefits are good, life\\work balance is promoted and people are awesome to work with, I noticed a high employment rotation, lots of contractors and interns in and out. Perhaps that is what makes the wheels to spin well at Gartner. 5.0 Account Executive | Irving, TX | Mar 28, 2016 Respected company, good compensation plans Great brand name and respected company among customers and competitors. Good work/life balance in most cases, there is a lot to do but freedom in scheduling the work. 3.0 Supply Chain Specialist | Stamford, CT | Dec 5, 2017 Great place to start your career. ï§ Provide research assistance to our research and vendor teams. ï§ Processing request from our corporate clients and vendors. ï§ Evaluating the nature of the request, and determining coverage areas for research ï§ Communicating and Coordinating with different branches within Gartner. ï§ Coordinate with group individuals and better facilitate processes in place. 4.0 Administrative Coordinator | Stamford, CT | Mar 6, 2016 Productive and cool workplace but no place to advance A typical day at work would consist of me going into the office at 8am. I would unpack my company laptop at my desk and the start working on projects that I have been assigned for the associates that our team of Computer Financial Consultants manages. That includes getting information on clients, putting in data to salesforce, Excel spreadsheets, emials, and personal projects for the associates, ect. I also manage all the associates expenses . Which I make a report and find receipts which they send and send it to FL where the main headquarters is . I make travel arrangements for the associates daily. Car service arrangements too. Keep a filing system. Also a inventory system for the office. I fax and copy all important documents. I pick up most important phone calls from clients and associates as well. Prosgood pay Consno benefits, Long term positions 5.0 Research Consultant | North Carolina | Oct 7, 2012 Was an enjoyable assignment with a fair remuneration plan. A very Professional Organization that was fair to their customers and employees. In addition, provided continuous training. The most difficult part of the assignment was major travel which was about 22 days per/month. Proshad high quality recognition rewards for exceptional performance. Consthe physical distance from my manager was approximately 500 miles. 4.0 Senior Account Executive | United States | Jan 15, 2018 Growing pains Gartner has been a great place to work, but is experience some obvious growing pains in its selection of sales management. Likely to turn around in the future. 2.0 Business Development Representative | Fort Myers, FL | May 18, 2017 Poor Management/No Job Security Gartner looks great on a resume, as well as the connections you make with c-level executives and Analysts. As a top achiever, a mentor/coach and a shadow lead who introduced candidates to Gartner's culture, I was dissappointed in how abruptly SMB shifted away from my morals and values. I found my achievements meant little and my job was never secure (all things I was told to tell applicants) \"Limitless opportunity\" was very limited and the culture became very corrupt. My manager was known for how much business she brought in, but never interrogated for how she sold it. She taught my team how to deceive my clients, lie to them and manipulate them to bring in a deal. Her email editing and forging skills were spectacular - she was valued for this behavior by VP's. Playing the corporate politics game is crucial here (but this is likely relevant for all SMB sales careers). Because services are sold through manipulation and when they weren't needed, retaining the accounts was nearly impossible. SMB will need to make some big changes if they want to save the department (hence the downward spiral many of us 2-year vets have experienced). Summary: Ask a new SMB Gartner rep and they'll say Gartner is awesome. Ask someone who has been there for a couple years... odds are they are trying to get out ASAP. My advice would be to get many alternative thoughts on Gartner before you apply. Current reps are compensated very nicely for telling you what you want to hear. ProsYoung atomosphere, great resume builder, good pay for being straight out of college ConsPoor management, no job security, misleading incentives 4.0 Senior Director of Operations | Remote | Mar 4, 2020 Gartner Gartner was a great place to work. Unfortunately my role was duplicative after the acquisition. Having said that I would recommend Gartner as a great place to work. 4.0 Client Services Specialist | Stamford, CT | Sep 9, 2019 Change of management. I spent 4-years at Gartner and my biggest concern was the constant change of manager. I had a half a dozen bosses and this was disconcerting, because, even though I was a great employee, my work history was forgotten. I knew all aspects of my job and I was good at it. However, I had to prove it for each passing manger. This takes time which better spent becoming familiar with taking on other assignments. And Since management only knew me for a short period of time, I was unable receive references for attempting another position within the same company. ProsFree fruit. Cons\"Too many chefs spoil the soup\" Questions And Answers about Gartner If you were in charge, what would you do to make Gartner a better place to work? Asked Jun 26, 2018 Empower the workers to do their job in a way that works for them. Be open to new ideas and make changes accordingly. Less micromanagement and more transparency. Answered May 15, 2020 Ensure middle management is asking meaningful questions about resources being aligned to strategic priorities of the business. The pursuit and dependence of metrics overshadows meaningful resource delivery against strategic initiatives. Answered Mar 1, 2020 How did you feel about telling people you worked at Gartner? Asked Nov 5, 2016 People know that Gartner has grown into a top company to work for. Answered Aug 15, 2017 I feel it is good thing to tell people it is a Global Company Answered Jun 1, 2017 What tips or advice would you give to someone interviewing at Gartner? Asked Feb 4, 2019 It is not enough to be client focused and wanting for your clients to succeed. You must enjoy a continually competitive culture driven by metrics. Answered Mar 1, 2020 Be authentic. Research what the company does and what your specific business unit focuses on, and then explain how your skills will benefit the team you will be on. Prepare questions beforehand to get a better understanding of the role and If it is the right fit for you, as well as questions about what growing with the company honestly looks like. Answered Nov 30, 2019 Is the company open to employees transferring to another location? If so, how long do you have to be in a position to request a transfer? Asked Oct 25, 2016 It depends on your boss. Some areas of recruiting are open, others are not. Overall it is frowned upon. They are very behind the ball on this one-more evidence of a culture that is not innovative, strategic or forward thinking. Answered Sep 26, 2018 Yes, Gartner says and tries to accommodate your career goals. 2 years is the time frame required to transfer unless you have very high success earlier. Answered Mar 12, 2018 What is the company culture like? Asked Oct 25, 2016 Not good on the recruiting side. Managers who have been there for years that should not be managing. Very reactive model. Nothing is planned and recruiters are very low on the totem pole. Answered Sep 26, 2018 Relatively conservative compared to younger companies. Seems hierarchical (top down), but not bureaucratic.
