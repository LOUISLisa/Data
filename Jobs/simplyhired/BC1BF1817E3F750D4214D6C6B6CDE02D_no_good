You need to be there earlier than bank opening, and stay for like 10hrs. after the bank close, you need to wait until the accounting dept balance all the transactions. But you just get paid 8hrs no overtime. You pay your mistake, sometimes even it's not yours. You are accountable for the loss: fake, overpayment, wrong posting, unauthorized withrawal etc... they will conduct investigation but at the end they will put their favors on the clients than their employees, and let employees suffer because they want a clean name in the limelight (hope Philippines will have a law for this) Salary increase every year. up to 16th month pay. with a lot of allowance and benefits.
