Skipthedishes is a center for the carrier advancement, in fact, is a training institute where potential of staff are manifested 4.0 Courier | Avenue, MD | Feb 23, 2020 Productive and efficient place to work at I enjoyed working in this company because the leads were supportive and interactive at all times. They would put extra effort to help us (employees) understand functions and programs or how to respond on the call if we were unaware or unable to. The most enjoyable part was there was always food during celebrations. 4.0 Care Specialist | Market, WV | May 15, 2019 Productive and fun workplace. Dynamic place to work with plenty of opportunity I've been with Skip for 16 months as a member of the Corporate Communications team. It's been a radical, but enjoyable shift from government work to the private sector. Now is a great time to join Skip as the company is busy developing internal best practices across the organization. I've found senior management to be open to collaboration and eager to utilize my expertise. ConsLess Hours 5.0 Independent Contractor | Buffalo, NY | Feb 8, 2019 You Can Make What You Put Into It I have over 4,000 deliveries with STD. When I first started some years ago, I would work 8-14 hours a day, no weekends. I was making anywhere from $850-1,000/week. Recently, the Buffalo area was split into two separate delivery areas because the couriers here complained about the amount of driving they had to do. Umm, you signed up to drive food around the city! Not to mention, the delivery address and delivery zone is clearly published on the driving app. After the delivery area split, I was unable to even come close to my previous earnings, due to limited shift availability. I also started working weekends, but I only averaged $250-350 week. In my opinion, splitting it delivery area up was the worst thing they did for us here. Even as such, I read reviews of people refusing to drive 15 minutes for a $6 delivery, which I find just ignorant. They basically refused a $24/hr pay rate. Even those that complain that they have to drive to a \"remote\" delivery address is rediculous, as if you know the area partner restaurants, there is probably one not that far from where your are delivering. I frequently look at the consumer app for the updated restaurants and compare that to the driver app delivery area. Sometimes, you have to take the small delivery jobs along with the higher paying ones. The dispatchers can be very appreciative and I've had some good working relationships with some. I have never refused an order and the dispatchers realize that. I've been assigned trip...more ProsExtra income, flexible hours, meeting people, finding great restaurants ConsOverhead - vehicle maintenance/gas, no guaranteed pay rate 4.0 Courier Driver | Buffalo, NY | Jun 23, 2018 Learn the game before you play Love it... Definitely fun for people who like to hustle. Park in the busiest area and get call after call, pay should have incentives for raise... turnover time, total jobs, etc.. Idk why some people can't tip a dollar.. shame ProsFreedom ConsYour expectations 4.0 Courier Driver | Buffalo, NY | Mar 17, 2018 Overall good job Only problem was some places did not have any parking so you would have to park really far and walk which would affect your time. Some neighborhoods were quite scary to be delivering to late at night. ProsGot to see the city ConsParking wasn't always available 3.0 Independent Contractor | Omaha, NE | Dec 13, 2017 You are the boss and fun place to work. A typical shift at Skip the Dishes will have you very active. When you log in to the application and begin your shift you may wait a while for the first delivery order but the order will usually be fast paced after that. You will drive many miles in your vehicle and discover many new restaurants and locations to deliver orders yet the application has an effective G.P.S. system. Proscreate your own schedule and you are your own boss Conslack of hours and small orders that are not profitable 4.0 Courier Driver | Buffalo, NY | Dec 6, 2017 It can be fun Sometimes you may get overwhelmed with many deliveries and someday you may not get many at all. It all depends on the location of where you are. Some other days you are lucky to find a parking spot close to the restaurant and someday you may have to walk a bit; slowing one down. The hardest part of my job is that sometimes having trouble finding where the costumer is but we work things out. Traffic can get hectic on a Friday and Saturday night. The most enjoyable part of the job is not having to deal with people constantly and driving; meeting new places and people. 5.0 Delivery Driver | Buffalo, NY | Jun 30, 2019 Nice job! I enjoyed being my own boss and I learned about some great restaurants that I plan dine with in the near future. Currently, I am experiencing some issues with scheduling. In the beginning blocks where available all the time. Not so much lately, currently trying to correct this issue.
