Start up benefits are great. The rest of the benefits seem great, but don't end up being what they seem to be. Some of the smartest employees with real drive to be successful and be a part of something bigger and create something better. 3.0 Regional Manager | New York, NY | Apr 19, 2020 Fast and Loose Sip the cool-aid Don't get swept away by the 'coolness'. This is a lean mean business environment cloaked in fun. Measure your success - Start with an impact to effort exercise You will need to defend your ROI on a consistent basis (like meeting with peers, executives, and even clients). Win fast - Fail fast This is a hyper agile, silo oriented, and lean margin environment. The company is laced (still) with top tier talent with top tier clients. The job will not be secure, but personal growth can be exponential if you are capable of putting in the energy/effort. 3.0 Front Desk Agent | New York, NY | Dec 16, 2019 Community... The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to interact with people. Not just the management team or staff, but the members themselves; there is a feeling of community, to an extent. 3.0 Security Officer | New York, NY | Apr 23, 2020 Creative place to work My daily tasks were: Respond to calls and messages requesting security, safety, or emergency assistance.Provides technical assistance as it relates to access control, CCTV systems, and other emergency management systems.

During my time there, I was able to work in multiple arenas and meet lots of different people. 5.0 Loan Processor | Mesa, AZ | Dec 8, 2019 Organized fun place with a since of direction getting into work having manageable pipeline having training making sure all systems are running having since of direction at the end of the day and seen a light end of the tunnel. 2.0 Warehouse Lead | San Antonio, TX | Nov 29, 2019 Enjoy working with coworkers Some manager awesome to be associated with. Great coworker work challenging at times. Good insurance work environment at times stressful but worked thru the difficult times 3.0 Operations Lead | Bellevue, WA | Nov 18, 2019 The BOOM before the BUST Met some great people and felt the \"WeWork energy\" - it really was a millennia's paradise for a time ... too bad the ego of one of the founders got in the way of what began as a great idea. 2.0 Lead Associate | Atlanta, GA | Jan 1, 2019 \"Startup\" company that takes advantage of a young workforce The work culture at WeWork immediately comes off as \"cool\" and \"startup-y\" but the truth is they take employees fresh out of college, keep them happy with beer on tap and mac laptops, and leave them to their own devices. With 50+ hour workweeks, mandatory Monday night meetings, and all the emphasis on the Sales Leads, this is a job to stay away from if you have any home life or self respect. Prosfree beer on tap, cool stickers Conslong work hours, short lunch breaks Questions And Answers about WeWork What is the interview process like at WeWork? Asked Oct 13, 2018 Interview process was very fast paced. Interviewed one day and was offered the position the next day.
