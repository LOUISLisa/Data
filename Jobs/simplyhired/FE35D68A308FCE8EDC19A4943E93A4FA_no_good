Passengers also get disturbed due to delays in departures and arrivals. Management takes full care of our valued clients at every steps,keep them inform at time to time regarding their concerns.Culture at office is very social and healthy. I Enjoys in all my postings at different places with meeting new peoples and know about their cultures. Overall i loved in all my tenure of 34 years. I Learned a lot from being polite which is also a part of our duties.Strong while i have to take decisions like cancellation of a flight that too from a station likt KULU AIRPORT where no other alternates except to travel by road, to manage taxis at the last minutes and provide hotel accomodations to the passengers confirmed on our flight. Since its a tourist place we donot get good hotels at the last minutes..It was fun and tought time also to managewith little staff at such station like KULU... 3.0 Junior Technical Engineer | United States | Apr 20, 2016 Gave good experience. Work over there was an experience, for I was a new face from college. Learned to manage things. I would start my shift by helping the shift in charge to allocate employees and equipment for various flight schedules. Then I would oversee the work in the respective area allocated to me. This would include collecting data from customers (other airlines), controlling baggage and cargo unloading/loading from/into aircrafts, and arranging equipment at cargo loading stations. Hardest part of the job was to coordinate the jobs given to me. Managing employees to get the job done is not easy. it requires good communication skill, and ability to cooperate. It was difficult in the beginning, but quickly I got accustomed with the conditions. After that the same part became the most enjoyable. 3.0 Check In / Ticketing at JFK | Queens, NY | Jan 15, 2019 Very stressful job it's airport operation then we have to work as quick response to any type of problems.
