EVERYTHING!! there are 2 types of contract: first 7,5 hour with 20 minutes brake,on that one you will have to deliver 900 kilograms its full van of groceries. second 10 hours (turnover) you will have to deliver 2 nearly full vans or sometimes full to top vans of groceries average of 1500 kilograms!! in busiest parts of London with no parking spaces. there is no gap for You to wipe of sweat from your forehead and forget about a brake you will have to use it to catch up. everyone will complain about You the customers non customers. people are going crazy about reporting everything to company and EVERY complain is taken seriously. customers are getting vouchers from company as we apology for any inconvenience so they report that you are parking in front of their house while you deliver to them! CRAZY stuff is going on. there is camera spying on you in the cab and dont exceed speed limits more then 1 mph system will catch this up. do not argue with anyone even if someone will try to kill you or himself while you trying to avoid collision with other useless road users. if someone is acting aggressively to you on the rd. you have to smile to him otherwise you get sucked! on site everything is running pretty good vans are prepared on time. marshals are doing good job. management is there to put in data to system and spy on you and put blame on you every time, its easy to put blam...more Prosha ha ha :) Consunderpaid to much of heavy deliveries to tight routes no time to take toilet brake 3.0 Driver | London, OH | Mar 11, 2020 Gets better if you stay for a while I've been working at a london spoke for 7 months. In my view the job gets much better over time. Months 2 - 3 were difficult for me. Most of the people I trained with had already quit, and I wasnt experienced enough to fire through my deliveries with any speed and I was coming back late all too often. After a while, you will become more confident with the van and moving the shopping around, plus you will have been to most the areas dozens of times so you will know the area. I find now about 1/3rd of my drops I recognise from previous deliveries, so I know where to go. The amount of time you get for a drop is based on the previous deliveries to this customer and the amount of food they are getting. So a top floor stairs with 7 totes they will give you a tidy 30 mins usually, which is nice because you dont feel you have to exhaust yourself. However, a 2 tote delivery to a house you'd be lucky for 5 minutes, so even easy deliveries you will have to keep moving.... no rest for the wicked ;) The downside is that you need to be able to keep up with an average driver to keep on schedule. If the last 5 guys did the drop in 12 minutes, then you will get 12 minutes regardless if you can keep up or not. This can be especially difficult when you have 25+ drops in a day. When you are starting out, it will be tough. If youre not used to a job like this you will find all the lifting tiring. You will be late a lot. My first 10 days, I finished late 9 times. But now I'm here fo...more ProsAfter a few months it is fairly enjoyable Consthe start is tough. 4.0 Development Director | Tysons Corner, VA | Nov 4, 2019 Amazing get it done culture; great team; A global Fortune level start up! I have never been associated with an organization like Ocado. Imagine going to work for a fortune 500 company that is run with the attitude of a start up. Fast, agile, motivated, high energy and fun... As a member of the North America Start up team, for this FTSE 50 company, I have been encouraged to innovate, create change, engage in and lead challenging company changing projects and collaborate globally with other team leaders. The entire Management structure is accessible and every person I have met has a \"lets get it done no matter what it takes\" attitude. Very Very cool environment. There are of course issues... problems... but where are there not. Ocado is a major, multi-billion dollar organization that is also one of the fastest growing in Europe. It is newly expanding into North America and the culture and business challenges, along with surprising technical challenges, cause bumps and twists in the road. We don't always agree and sometimes we quite assertively disagree; but everyone is encouraged to push the limits of their job and technology so that we can push the success of the organization forward. Not only is there great encouragement; failure is not seen as damming to a career. The attitude is \"Well that didn't work, how do we fix it and move on? What did we learn? and now lets go try again!\" Additional challenges include moving from a major on-line grocer to an amazing leading edge (read bleeding edge) tech company that is pushing the boundaries...more 4.0 Personal Shopper | Zone, OH | Apr 26, 2018 Busy so you never get bored I just started here and on nights and pick. It's very fast paced if you want to keep up with targets and alot of walking. I'm loving the job for me it's perfect as I like to keep on the go and busy and also helps lose weight :D I prefer the night shift which is also extra money. My only wish is that they are set shifts. It's hard to get into a routine with sleep when one week you could do 4 nights in a row. Then 2 in 1 off 2 in 2 off and so on. But when you have like 1 day off it's difficult to find a sleep pattern. So I feel set shifts would be better for night shift workers as it's a very demanding Job so you do burn out quickly and walking so much with safety shoes on kills your feet. People so far are very nice. I don't like walking round and not being able to understand a word alot of them are saying and honestly I don't think it should be aloud that way. Everyone should speak the same language whilst at work. But I like the place at the moment and hope I'm here for a while. Great pay for me as I get an extra Â£400 a month to what I originally earned without any overtime which is great! ProsGood money ConsNot set shifts on nights 5.0 CSTM | Dartford, WA | Dec 4, 2014 Fun Work places, with room to progress ( seen with my own eyes ) Come in, print your route and go to your pre loaded van, which already has the engine on so you don't even have to do that. Check it over for damage etc. Managers are good and always ask is everything ok. Work atmosphere when in the office is friendly, loads of out of work activities arranged, and in work. Job is straight foward. Drive legally you will be fine. If you don't ofcourse your in trouble. Get caught using your phone by police while driving you don't get away with it also, so I don't know why some reviews say it's bad you will get in trouble. Cam in the van is also ok if your doing the right thing. If someone crashes into you and ain't your thought, think or not that cam will defend you. Managers have a open door policy. The operations manager even sits down with people to see how there doing. As of all jobs there's bad days, but take that with a pinch of salt. ProsBonus, Can go home early, good pay, Easy job ConsCentral London ( not that often ) 3.0 Customer Service Representative | Leeds, AL | Sep 27, 2014 Good Company, with a small amount of Poor Managers to ruin it! It's a shame that such a good professional company is ruined by a small number of managers who are put in place and have no idea or experience of how to manage, full stop. Things can become personal and you can feel a little bit picked on by managers above, who clearly are out of their depth. For the drivers, it's a decent job, not many jobs in this sector offer all staff private health and 15% discount, although the shifts aren't great if you have a family, or like weekends off. But hey, not many jobs don't include shifts anymore! All in all it's ok, but just be careful of the incompetent managers, not many as I said, but the ones that are there can make life hard for you, should you come across them. ProsDecent money for what you do, private health 15% staff discount ConsPoor shift patterns, some terrible managers 4.0 ctsm | Stanford, IN | Jul 20, 2014 nice work if you can get it Easiest driving job. Van loaded for you. Sat navigation tells u where to go. Go home early if u finish early. Vans well maintained. Lovely drives thru the countryside down roads u wouldn't take ur own car down! Company ethos is to be nice to each other. Novel but seems to work. Various shift bonuses and a quarterly bonus for turning up an not crashing the truck. Overtime starts after 40 hours- generous in these times and often available. High standard of driver due to multi stage application process, warehouse staff friendly and helpful, managers friendly and professional. Best delivery job out there. Prosvan pre loaded, easy to drive, sat nav, good pay for the work Conscarrying shopping up stairs (doesn't happen that often) 1.0 Driver | Sheffield, AL | Jan 17, 2019 Hard work poor pay no life keep away at all costs.bad management.u can do 35 drops 250 miles.On after moons u can get back home at one or two in the morning.it is a very clicky place.u get sent to Lincoln Scunthorpe Gainsborough homefirth Doncaster just a few to mention.if systems go down in the middle of nowhere like Lincoln in a small village u ring management they leave u in the ð¤.it happened to me.if u want a life and got a family keep away.money is ð¥for what u do.some lads where great but most was up the manager back ð to get better drops. If it's bad weather or snowing they still send u and it could be Matlock bradfield if u get stuck it's Ur fault and get warnings or the sack.ocado Hitler . ProsNone ConsIt's all bad 2.0 Delivery Driver | Manchester, NH | May 17, 2020 Terrible attitude towards drivers The whole attitude of the management towards its drivers is disgusting and bullying, Management positions filled with people that have no understanding or empathy towards their staff and a very arrogant approach when you might need understanding. Massive turn over and its easy to see why. ProsWeekly pay ConsAlways only 1 minute away from the sack 1.0 Personal Shopper | Staffordshire, VA | Mar 9, 2019 How i found working at ocardo I found working at Ocado very hard the job itself was fairly easy although the English language is the minority which can be intimidating at times this is a very fast pace job with bonuses for the faster you work although if your not fast enough you will be asked to leave as they have a high turnover of employment Questions And Answers about Ocado Is it monthly pay or weekly ? Asked Mar 7, 2017 Weekly pay Answered May 11, 2019 Pay is Weekly Answered Aug 25, 2018 What are the shifts that van drivers do Asked Mar 6, 2019 It varies but mornings and afternoon shifts. They stagger start and finish times although afternoon shift finishes no later than midnight. If you are running late they do pay you. If you finish a little earlier they pay you the full pay.
