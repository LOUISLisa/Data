That\u2019s right, this isn\u2019t your father\u2019s development project, we are building mission critical applications that will shape the future; a future where you have direct impact! We are truly building the best in breed software, so naturally we are an interesting animal. Our frontend is largely Angular8 and deployed to the web, desktop (via Electron), and mobile (via Cordova). The frontend communicates with backend services though lightweight RESTful API calls to the serviceMesh gateway (Envoy, FreeIPA, NiFi, & HaProxy) which themselves broker requests to an event store (Kafka). Once in Kafka, individual services perform their respective actions in accordance with a pure pub/sub model. Our backend is largely comprised of \u2019serverless\u2019 microservices, with most being ran on firecracker (AWS Lambda\u2019s engine) and those too large (like Kafka, Elastic Search, etc.) are ran in containers on Kubernetes. Of course, we\u2019ve got some secret sauce here and there, but we are using open standards wherever possible. The ideal candidate will: Be eager to learn new technologies and expand their roles and responsibilities. Excel at translating functional requirements into quality code. Have a knack for efficiency. Be familiar with industry best practices and open-source enablers (libraries, tools, tech). Possess a demonstrable acumen for detail, but not quite debilitating perfectionism. Be comfortable thinking outside the box and proposing better methods to code/structure the app. Be comfortable with agile software development (don\u2019t worry, we aren\u2019t a sweat-shop). Have solid technical understanding and experience with Angular (6+ years). Be familiar with event-streaming architectures (using Kafka & serviceMeshes). Be familiar with modularity and microservice architectures. Have experience creating NodeJS microservices Each scrum member is both a leader and a follower. As a Senior developer, you will be expected to help mentor more junior developers, but do expect to learn a thing or two yourself. Some travel may be required on an as needed basis. Eventually, this position may require a government security clearance. Office hours are flexible with most work performed remotely (as we are a geographically dispersed team) but some actions may require travel and regular team interaction. Most of our team works out of on-trend, workshare office spaces around the nation. We offer competitive benefits (fully-vested up to 10% 401k matching, 100% company-paid comprehensive healthcare, all 10 federal holidays & 15 days leave, flexible schedules, educational reimbursements, and much more). Skyward Federal is a small (but growing) startup bringing the best of breed to the most exciting & unique missions possible. We work hard but play harder. There is constant room for growth and cross-training depending on what your life goals are. Apply now & start your journey today!
