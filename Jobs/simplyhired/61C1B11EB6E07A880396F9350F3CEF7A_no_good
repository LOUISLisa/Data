Having the responsibility of marshalling and handling several aircraft a day holding 100+ people and the day goes by fast. It's a fast paced environment and the people you work with also do their best no matter the situation. Unfortunately those are the only good things about the place. -Horribly understaffed (Started with 40 agents, lucky to have 10 in an entire day now) and expected to pick up the slack for no extra pay or motivation to do so. -Communication is nonexistent here. Something you do one week could get you written up the next and you have no idea about the change until they punish you for it. Management has meetings every week, only allow leads and supervisors to attend and somehow expects everyone else to know whats new even though they can't attend. -Work morale has been killed here since Menzies showed up. Every time something goes wrong, management tries to throw an agent under the bus, write them up and call it a day instead of trying to fix the problem. They even try to overcomplicate the simplest of tasks in our work, which in turn takes the fun out of it that keeps us going. -Only had 2 uniforms for first 3-4 months of work when working 5 day weeks. Only get max of 4, which still doesn't last a week. -Pay is consistently wrong. One of our agents was missing an entire 2 weeks worth of pay and another was missing over 20 hours of overtime in a single period even though it was all handwritten and turned in directly to manag...more ProsThe work, the coworkers ConsLow Morale, Inconsistent Pay, Shortstaffed, Unstable 1.0 Fueler | San Diego, CA | Jan 27, 2020 Worst Place I've worked so far If you do plan on appying for this job which I can imagine why you might try to do the following: -Make Friends Fast (Co-Workers are awesome and they'll understand your struggle and will help you more than the actual Management) -Stay Away From Supervisor (Keep them to a neutral don't do \"favors\" or \"help them out\" they won't do the same.) -Always Keep Looking (These Guy Fire and have people Quit left and right, Like it's water) -Don't bring anything you need to put in a fridge (there appliances are F disgusting and so is there whole shop) -Realize your one of the lowest paid branches and some People that work at mcdonalds have better pay and benefits than you (Lets just get that out of the way) -Don't rely on their Benefits to help you (They hardly Cover anything). -Don't Try going to the Union or your representative (Your representative heardly ever introduces himself eats by himself and does it work quitely while breaking every rule and the union doesn't care as long as you keep paying them) -Follow EVERY STUPID RULE (Even if the supervisor don't or say \"They Don't Care\" cause they will find a way to fire you when they don't like you and that is usually how they fire people.) -Forget About Having A Social/ Family Life (You Can pick 2 Shifts 5am-1pm which hardly ever leaves at 1 and your likely to get drafted which means you need to pull a double and you will be exhuasted. 1:30pm-10pm everything is either closed or everyone is asleep.) -Recor...more 3.0 Fueler | Indianapolis, IN | Sep 26, 2019 Ridiculously unorganized Job work/life balance was easy enough. Most of the time we were out early, you have to stay for a plane if it's delayed but they wouldn't force you. Compensation/benefits were laughable. Could not afford to take the benefits because then my paycheck would have been even more ridiculous. Job security/advancement was decent as far as I could tell. Company has a pretty high turnover rate which meant that a lot of people stretch the rules (call off, no call no show) and they still have jobs. As far as advancement goes, no one really wants to deal with being a ''supervisor'' in the company even though the supervisors try and alleviate themselves of as much real work as possible so I don't see why not. Management was basically non-existent. It's definitely a hands off job but there were a couple of situations that I personally got into that caused a lot of trouble due to poor management. Job culture is terrible. The people that I worked with were fun to be around, good team players but the environment that you work in is terrible. The break rooms are filthy (people don't care about them because they come in and they aren't cleaned so it just snowballs). one of the break rooms has a cage in it to section off a small part of the room because ''Menzie's didn't want to pay for the whole room'' Overall it was a good experience. The managers/supervisors are lazy to a fault but if you can get over that and need a launch pad in order to transition to another job, I'd recomme...more ProsLot of alone time, Self reliant ConsTerrible pay, terrible benefits, upper management doesn't care, middle management is lazy 5.0 Passenger Service Agent | San Jose, CA | Mar 9, 2015 Demanding, stressful, fast paced work place. This job has been by far the most stressful workplace ever for me. Everyday is different as the Passengers are. This workplace and its duties really taught me to be patient with people and to always keep humble. Management here was very Professional and precise. Employee meeting were held every day before our shift started and at the end of it. Since we were dealing with flights, delays can happen. My Coworkers here were different from any other work place. We did not talk too much since we were all very busy most of the shift. However, if any of us needed help, someone would come to help out. For the most part, everyone was in their own lane since it was a fast paced work place. The hardest part of this job was when the Airline had delays or Passengers wanted to check in more baggage than approved. Passengers would get upset, enraged, and emotional. Since we had Security on site I told myself that wouldn't be a big problem. I did however find it hard at first having to deal with the emotional but as time went by and it happened more often I learned to not let it get to be because they should know better and read the terms and conditions upon purchasing their ticket. The most enjoyable part of this job to me was at the end of the shift when all Agents would gather for our daily meeting. I loved it when our Supervisor would tell us what a great job we did. Out of any job I've held this one has been the most stressful, yet rewarding job. It disciplined and s...more 1.0 Fueler | Orlando, FL | May 9, 2019 This company sucks do not appy Menzies over all is a horrible company. The fueling was easy and fun, but your pay in Orlando is 11.50 you get one raise to 12.00 and than you top out with that until they negotiate a contract which will never happen at all. The older people been there for 20 years and only making 14 bucks. Your check with 80hrs every two weeks be 790 or 780 each paycheck. You will literally have to work at least 4 doubles to make a thousand dollar check. The Supervisor and leads do whatever they want, communication is bad. Supervisors leave early or go home for 5hrs and clock out while the lead is the only one on the field helping the fuelers. No matter what if you tell the fueling manager that the Supervisor is treating unfairly he doesn't care.Btw his name is John and all he does is sit in the office. He is never on the field to see what's going on. Fueling equipment is very bad trucks got fuel vapor coming through the vents and on 3 trucks the transmission are bad but they still make us drive them knowing that it is unsafe. Benefits are horrible also this job is only worth it if you want to get experienced other than that dont come to menzies at all it's a waste of time. I would never come back to this company. They already in the process of losing stations all over Florida and it is a matter of time before they lose Orlando. ProsFueling its fun to learn how to fuel all kinds of aircrafts ConsYou have to stay a extra 30mins after to get a total of 8hrs and equipment is old and broke down 2.0 Customer Service Representative | Windsor Locks, CT | Jul 19, 2018 Sketchy, Revolving Door I would ONLY reccomend working for Menzies Aviation in Windsor Locks, CT if you literally don\u2019t have a life outside of work and don\u2019t mind being treated as a tool. If you have young children, responsibilities that can take you from work, not able to work 10+ hours and free to potentially work your days off due to people just not showing up, then this job is for YOU ! The job is listed as part time, DEPENDING on what contract Menzies decides to assign you to ( where staff need is greater and seasonal flight schedule) \u2014 DO NOT WORK FOR SPIRIT AIRLINES. VIVIAN PEREZ AGOSTINI IS THE WORST. 60% of the time when they\u2019re properly staffed, you\u2019re able to work your 8hr shift then go home, however there are times where you\u2019ll be needed to cover and they won\u2019t care what important things you may have to due after work so be ready for the guilt trip. While the hire ups leave promptly at 3pm regardless of issues. You\u2019re likely to be yanked around if you have any questions regarding benefits or any questions at all.. ( BENEFITS ARE AVAILABLE TO FULL TIME ONLY) you\u2019re hired as part time and even though you work 32+ hours a week, you\u2019ll never have your status changed to receive those benefits. No paid days off, or vaca. To be frank, if you just want a check every other Friday and don\u2019t care about benefits, drama, and never having your questions answered. Apply. They\u2019ll lay you off when the airline\u2019s contract is up anyway. ProsNone ConsStress, stress, more Stress. 3.0 Fueler | Austin, TX | Jun 11, 2018 Everything is broken and nothing is being done about it. The job is fairly easy once you know what you\u2019re doing. And it\u2019s a great job to start off in the field of aviation, but definitely not a long time gig. We aren\u2019t provided adequate equipment to do the job in a proper, safe, and efficient manner. Employees are busting their backs to get the flights out on time with equipment that\u2019s in shambles and unsafe to operate, yet we can\u2019t take the equipment out of service because \u201cthat\u2019s not getting the planes fueled\u201d... and maintenance isn\u2019t approved to order the parts to fix it because the company doesn\u2019t want to spend money. After an exhausting shift and getting all flights out on time with no delays, you don\u2019t get appreciated. You are required to work overtime because they are constantly understaffed, 4am - 7 or 8pm (sometimes later) then expected to be back in at 4am the next morning. Also when they say they care about your safety, they don\u2019t. The ground handling side at this station also lost its two biggest contracts so don\u2019t bother going over there either, it\u2019s the same story. Let\u2019s not even get into the belittling you get when you ask for time off or have to call in sick. One good thing is 95% of the other employees are awesome to work with and easy to get along with. ProsUnlimited overtime, almost no rules to follow ConsOverworked, under appreciated, underpaid, very little down time 5.0 Baggage Handler | Portland, OR | Apr 28, 2014 Hard working and fun environment Every day working for Menzies Aviation was hard, challenging, stressful, fun and exciting. I learned about how the baggage crews at the airport operate, I improved majorly on my physical and mental strength and learned how to be more time efficient. There is a lot more to it then just loading bags and cargo on and off of the airplanes. I had to make sure to count every single piece of cargo and every bag that went on the airplane and stack them in the planes pits correctly so that we could always fit the maximum number of pieces and bags. I had the responsibility of checking the airplane for any major or non-major damage, and to report that damage to Airport Operations immediately. The hardest part about this job is the amount of physical labor it demands out of a single person. You have to able to work and move at very fast pace and not slow the whole team down. You have to avoid flight delays at all costs and prove to every one of your coworkers that you can handle this job, which is very hard to do, especially if you are a female. The best part about this job was hard labor it required. It challenged me and pushed me to a new limit everyday. I loved being challenged and pressured to push myself. ProsGood pay, hours, coworkers. ConsMinimal breaks, no overtime, harsh supervisor 3.0 Human Resources Coordinator | San Francisco, CA | Aug 17, 2012 routine kind of job My work is time managed on a daily basis. Every morning I would collect all the service sheets from the dispatch office and start inputting all the airline turns on our RSMS system. I do payroll every Monday- It is the busiest day of the week. I gather all of the employee hours and I make sure that all of their hours are accurately calculated in the system then submit all the information to my payroll manager. I then make a PTO report from the system and input the PTOs taken by the employee on my spreadsheet then I submit that to the other bosses. I also pick up cash/check deposits from different airline location and deposit the cash to HSBC then I deposit the checks electronically in our office and put it in our journal. I also do bookkeeping and other financial assistance to our Finance Controller.Every month we submit a monthly revenue report to our managers. My job was very challenging since it involves a lot of calculations. I learned a lot of computer softwares and applications and I truly enjoyed the company of my 2 co-workers in our department. what I like about my job was that I had to do my job without the help of my supervisor and that I feel like I was important to the company. Prostravel benefits Consshort breaks, no incentives 3.0 Baggage Handler | SeaTac, WA | Jul 22, 2015 Coworkers are the only ones who make the job worth keeping A typical day, you are assigned up to 6 flights. A busy and hectic one you are assigned to more. During the summer is the busiest. There will days where there will be no lunch breaks, just back-to-back flights, non-stop work. For the upper management, there are a lot of unfair treatment and favoritism. People get promoted undeservedly. Some people are not even prepared for anything. That is why there are so many accidents. They do not observe the employees carefully. Also, upper management hide behind others by talking negative about other people instead of approaching them about what their issues are. Words do go around and if that person hears about it, they will surely not want to work with them. No communication, no teamwork. Some of the upper management are just hypocrites. They talk down on the employees and make them do mandatory overtime, even when it does not have an 8-hour gap between the employees' shifts. Each crew keeps each other going, that is the only reason some stay to deal with the hardship. Management is the only issue. ProsFun coworkers, easy flights, some nice customers, good crews ConsLess breaks, more flights, rude customers, hypocritical management, unfair treatment Questions And Answers about Menzies Aviation Do they offer free flights Asked Feb 7, 2017 Working at frontier in Denver, we get unlimited standby flights Answered Mar 12, 2020 1 standby flight with Air Canada per year but you must have a passport. Answered Dec 11, 2019 How do you feel about the future of Menzies Aviation? Asked Sep 26, 2016 Absolutely not ever again Answered Aug 7, 2019 The company is a joke and so is their senior leadership. The field operations management and above have zero respect for anyone other than collecting a hefty check to sit on their butts and stir gossip and trouble. They don\u2019t care about their employee or customers. Poor safety record with tons of aircraft damage. I don\u2019t know why airlines risk their reputation by working with Menzies a receipt for disaster. It\u2019s the most corrupt company I have ever encountered. Not sure why the feds haven\u2019t closed them down. Run away fast. Answered Jul 27, 2019 Do you have a job description of a ramp agent ?
