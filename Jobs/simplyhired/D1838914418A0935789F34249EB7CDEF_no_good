About the Role We are seeking a part-time Data Scientist (we're only considering US-based applicants at this time) to help us analyze and test the effectiveness of OpenMind interventions. The Data Scientist will play an essential role in analyzing the data that are collected for our interventions, resulting in data-driven insights that will meaningfully improve our programs and amplify our positive impact. The ideal candidate will have experience programming in R, performing advanced statistical analysis (e.g., multiple regression, mixed effects modeling, and statistical mediation and moderation), and creating compelling data visualizations. The ideal candidate will also be familiar with social science research (especially social psychology). The Data Scientist will work with the Research Director to coordinate randomized controlled trials and to collect, analyze, and synthesize data with the goal of continually working to understand and improve the effectiveness of our interventions.
