Its a lot of hard work, be willing and ready. Assertive leaders, strive for greatness. Be ready to join a team that will express HOPE. 1.0 Insurance Agent | Addison, TX | Sep 9, 2019 high pressure high turnover High pressure from management to perform... Extremely high turnover with average length of employment around 5-6 months. Strongly advised to work weekends, holidays, nights. Prosweekly commissions paid Consno benefits, telemarketing sales 2.0 Healthcare Assistant | Orlando, FL | May 23, 2020 Only commission Very odd system of hierarchy. There wasn\u2019t an HR or anything, just a large groups of people split in teams in different districts, each team with 1 leader each leader decides how they want to split payment which is only on PayPal whether it was 50% of profit or 100 dollars per sale (which is NOT often). Was told id have base pay and never got it. Cold calls, you work your own hours but you can\u2019t trust anyone to really help you that\u2019s outside of your team. They can be greedy since you have to fend for yourself it\u2019s possible to get rich off of this job but it is extremely difficult 2.0 Insurance Agent | Dallas, TX | Nov 19, 2017 Pyramid structure designed to benefit a few rather than all employees. High pressure sales company, no job security, production had to be weekly to survive, almost everyone I went through training with had no choice but to quit because it was 100% commission and not easy to earn enough money to get through the learning curb. Also, the managers do not care that new people were having to constantly be hired because they made money off our sales, a pyramid structure. 4commission based ProsMake own schedule Consvery high pressure job 5.0 Licensed Agent | United States | Jan 8, 2018 Captive agents we come and go The company is a team player environment. We all build each other up and have fun at using games and contests to boost sales and bring a positive tone to the office. ProsCome and go ConsCaptive agent 4.0 Licensed Agent | Englewood, CO | Jan 13, 2020 Hype! The opportunity to make money here is Real. But you have to Sell your Soul to do It, the 18-hour Workday Is very Common. For a 1099 Position. they ask you to give up your life and family 4.0 Customer Service Representative | Fort Worth, TX | May 31, 2018 Challenging but rewarding job Best part of the job is helping people in need save 30% on their health care. Typical day consistent of making 150-200 outbound calls to people in several states to educate and write insurance plans for their well-being and budget. ProsGood Pay ConsLack of viable leads and marketing-affects pay tremendously 3.0 Insurance Agent | Aurora, CO | May 10, 2019 Awesome alternative to ACA This is an incredible opportunity if you have an existing book of business to rewrite from another carrier, OR, if you have any existing line of coverage-like P & C and would like to offer health, life and accident to your existing clients. The commissions and advances are phenomenal! However, if you're trying to find brand-new business, it may be quite challenging. ProsGreat opportunity! ConsNot for everyone! 5.0 Insurance Agent | Longwood, FL | Nov 27, 2018 Met lots of interesting people. Fun atmosphere! The hardest part of the job was getting to talk to people in an attempt to make a sale. Leads were great in the beginning and then went down hill thereafter. I would recommend this position to someone who has a significant savings. The managers do very well though because of the hierarchy!! ProsGreat Peers! ConsNot enough income 1.0 Insurance Producer | Englewood, CO | Oct 3, 2017 Stressful Stressful job, because of the cold calling. Otherwise, you need to purchase your own leads. My manager was very good and fun to work for. If you are aggressive in sales over the phone, you might do well. ProsSome free lunches ConsLong hours Questions And Answers about USHA Is every position in the company is 100% commission and without the base salary ?
