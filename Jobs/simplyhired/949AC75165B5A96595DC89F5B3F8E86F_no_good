the world. I have worked at Wegmans for four years and I can honestly say it is great if you need extra cash, or are really young like I was when I started. Unfortunately, Wegmans has a lot of problems with management and I could list a multiplicity of things but here's four problems with examples. 1.) Wegmans Good Ole Boys Club Wegmans has a habit of employing the young and beautiful. I'm 22, definitely not what you'd consider old, but definitely older than most of my fellow co-workers. Wegmans has no problem promoting you to front end coordinator, pushing you into different departments, or promoting you to department coordinator, as long as you do it in the first 6 months you're working there. For some reason there's this really sick atmosphere that promotes all the newest employees into positions of power while everyone else is left fighting on the bottom end of the totem pole. It's weird and extremely obnoxious considering there are people with degrees who can't get promoted to store manager, but a recent high school grad is upper management before you know it. 2.) Communication is HORRIBLE If you ever have to call off for something, make sure you call 3 times that day to let them know you can't come in because your message WILL NOT be passed around and you may end up with a strike on your record. 3.)

I worked as a prep cook in the kitchen full time. My typical day would be working any time any day with two days off a week. As a prep cook you are looked at at do everything from prepping foods, orders, product rotation, setting hot bars/cold bars and assisting with catering. With such a heavy workload you aren't paid as much as line cooks, lead cooks, sous chefs and executive/store chefs even though your work load is much more hands on and physical and you are working much worse hours. Management at Wegmans is absolutely terrible. Many of the higher up chefs and cooks do not help and simply just talk all day or stay up in their office when the kitchen is short staffed and being pounded with work. Many of the managers have only worked at Wegmans their whole life or have kissed a lot of butt to get where they are so they have completely unrealistic expectations for what work that needs to be done in a day. These people are called lifers and you can sniff them out as soon as they walk through the door because everyone runs up to them to kiss there butt (instead of doing useful work to help). As a full timer you can be transferred to a different store at any time. This leaves you with a lot of uncertainty every day because you never know when you're going to be the next one to be transferred. When you want to move up with the company you have re-post...more 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Charlottesville, VA | Oct 4, 2018 Corporate is Great, the store--not so much I started out at Wegmans as a full time employee in prepared foods. When I first started, things were great--and at the other stores I trained in, things were great. Now, things are miserable. The managers are always fighting and pulling employees into their personal squabbles. The morale in my department is nonexistent. No one wants to be there because there is no pleasing management. You could do everything asked of you, plus every extra project you could think of, but there will always be one thing you didn't prioritize, and you will always get lectured about it or sometimes even threatened. The goalposts are always moving. Policy changes like the weather and its impossible to keep up with. If you ask five different employees how to do a task, they will give you five different answers, because things are not communicated well. A given task might change 2-3x a week. The scheduling is a nightmare. There are often times when people are scheduled alone for multiple hours at a time, and sometimes no one is scheduled in the department at all. Full timers are often stuck working 7-10 days in a row, all closing shifts or close-to-opens. There's no consistency. You could be working 2:30-11 one day and 5-1:30 the next. As a full time employee, you don't get an availability, so forget about going to school, working a second job, or having any life outside of work whatsoever. Requests for time off are often ignored. You could put in a request for time off three months in ad...more ProsAwesome Coworkers, Good Benefits for Full Timers, Corporate is Cool ConsBad Management, No Work-Life Balance 4.0 Pizza Cook | Gainesville, VA | Dec 20, 2018 Worked at Wegmans for 7 years Wegmans has it's own culture. It has an entire book filled with things that Wegmans takes pride in, including a quality product, excellent customer service, and it greatly cares for its employees. It's a massive store, with so many departments that the day-to-day can vary, but I worked mostly on the Prepared Foods side. There can be a good amount of stress in the kitchen, Wegmans is regularly inspected by not only state inspectors, but food safety inspectors from within the company. These inspectors are much more thorough than typical health inspectors, for the purpose of maintaining high standards for the company. Holidays can also be very stressful, as the catering department gets a ton of business, especially around Thanksgiving, where my store sold well over 300 turkey dinners. Wegmans cares about customer service above all, you will learn how to professionally deal with customers so that they have the best experience possible. If you go into Wegmans, the employees are willing to help you with whatever you need, even if it isn't in their department. Wegmans also really cares about their employees. The pay they offer is pretty competitive, I was making about $16.50 as a full-time Pizza employee. They offer a wide arrangement of benefits, but those mostly go to Full-Time employees. They offer Healthcare plan options, dental options, and a 401k with a 6% matching investment. Keep in mind that you will get employee discounts, but not for groceries or food for the...more ProsExcellent Pay, Benefits, Professional environment ConsStrict workplace policies that must be adhered to. 3.0 Customer Service Representative | Pittsford, NY | Oct 11, 2019 Good company values, but hard to advance Wegmans has really high standards,which I pride myself in upholding. Keeping the work space clean and providing quality products is the key. I also had zero experience in the food industry, so even though I didn't qualify for the position I wanted, they MADE a position for me, which I've never had happen for me at other employers. The rose-tinted glasses came off when I realized that my area manager refuses to hire me on as full time, despite the fact that I already work 32 hours and he calls me in MULTIPLE times a week to work when I'm not scheduled. I could really benefit from dental insurance, but they don't want to have to cover anyone in my department for full time. You have to do a LOT to get fired, which is a double-edged sword. You can make a lot of mistakes, but when your co-workers are lazy and take 20-30 minute 'bathroom breaks' when you have a line out the door, they won't get fired. One guy I work with vaped something that smelled like marijuana IN THE STORE and he hasn't gotten fired yet. You can't work to a higher position unless you know the right people, which is ridiculous since how hard you work doesn't matter. I worked 3 major holidays without complaint and never took vacation time, but got written up for 'missing too many shifts' even though I had LEGITIMATE reasons to miss my shifts such as being in a literal car accident, fracturing my tailbone outside of the job, or being physically ill.

When I began my employment with them 5 years ago I was still in school and they promised me I would be moved to a full time position after I graduate college.When I graduated and I was ready for my fulltime position because they knew they could get me to work almost 40 hours part time so every time I would try to apply for a full time position they would make up some excuse why I couldn't do it even though I was more than qualified for the position and earlier this place they unfairly disciplined me by having me on a 6 month written warning probation for something that wasn't even my fault so they can keep me from applying for another position and damaging the good career I been working really hard at everyday. When it comes to job promotions they seem to only promote employees they clearly seem to prefer a lot being attractive younger girls over others even though many of the ones they never preferred were some of the hardest and most productive workers there and the ones that they prefer also get promoted within their first year while others who been there forever never get moved up.

They are slow if not opposed to hiring older individuals(people over 40) regardless of prior related working experience. Wegmans is very selective on whom they hire. While they are generous in granting time-off requests, they are on a toxic work environment path. They are over focused on Audits, Inspections, rules, and procedures. They throw out, give to pig farms, or give to charity all old food not allowing employees to have an option to take anything home unless they pay for it. I have received better benefits from other employers that were unique to them, that Wegmans can never nor will never offer. On a typical day one might enjoy the work atmosphere and the laid back attitude of coworkers and management. They have extensive training and personal enhancement courses to make everyone better employees. In principle the managers work side-by-side with employees but the managers generally stay in whatever area they are most comfortable with. Working commercial bakery which is mostly the sales floor and bake product storage area of the store, I only see the managers in passing. Regrettably the workplace culture is one of constant search for efficiency which often is purely a matter of perspective and judgement. The managers ideas of efficiency trumps any objection or alternative thoughts of regular employees. ...more ProsPositive surface atmosphere, friendly work environment, flexible and easy work and time-off request system ConsStrict enforcement of time usage, no tolerance for human errors and mistakes 1.0 Department Manager | Wilkes-Barre, PA | Nov 24, 2018 A far cry from the family-focused, customer-serviced based history Wegmans was founded upon The things I liked- You'll meet some great co-workers and life-long friends along the way. The Wegmans brand and quality are top-notch. Compensation for salary-level managers far exceeds the grocery industry. Health insurance premiums for the employee are by far some of the lowest i've ever seen. The things I didn't like- No employee discount. The rapid expansion of the company (3-4 new store openings a year) has put a strain on the talent pool and product sourcing. The management team of today is either too new and not properly vetted for their roles, or just not proper fits for their roles (from a professionalism/education/preparedness/culture-fit standpoint). Too many new programs, priorities, wasteful meetings about \"this, that, and the other thing\" that are bogging down labor-strapped managers who could be saved time by just getting an email. Company culture has changed significantly towards the negative (again, this trended this way due to a surplus of now \"bad/toxic managers\" at the senior store &amp; division leadership level who are simply just \"yes-men\"). My advice to the leadership at the top- Corporate partners and executives need to start understanding the effects that the rapid over-expansion of the company (as well as the constant new program roll-outs) has done at local (store) level.

I have worked in two locations, every part of the bakery department, and as both a full time and part time employee. When I started in Northborough the deepest personal conflict was that we all got tired of each other, which happens when you run your mouth all day (because it's easy when you work with your hands). We were tight knit and it could get difficult to deal with some people complaining all the time about the same problems they could easily fix by bringing it up to a TL, who all are very understanding and receptive. That being said, Wegmans really is like a family and I have never expected to genuinely miss the people I spent years of my young adult life working with. A+ to Northborough Wegmans. Since January I have been working in Westwood, where the management ignores pleas for more training or help, where you have to go right to HR to resolve conflicts with exceptionally difficult team mates, work overtime daily because the department is always understaffed and get scolded for staying when no one else will either help or hire help, and by accepting a full time job, you will entirely be sacrificing your work-life balance (which supposedly the company supports).

If you're not from Rochester, or actively spying on other employees to report to the merch manager, you're going to be jumping through a lot of hoops to move up. They constantly pick and choose which rules to follow and which to break if it benefits them or if it means they can discipline someone they don't really like. Management behaves like a clique in high school, ignoring you as they walk by in groups with their coffees all day chatting and laughing, but calling you into HR if you spend 2 minutes catching up with another co-worker. They'll give you hell if one of your endcaps are slightly out of stock, but don't bother to do any work themselves. There is a lot of inconsistency to which rules they follow in each department, and transgressions by the Rochester crowd are often overlooked. 80% of my co-workers are constantly on the look-out for jobs outside the company, and management pretends to be upset, but the more full-time staff that leave, the less benefits they have to pay out. They constantly spout the \"Who We Are\" values, but the application of caring and support in upper management in HR is a farce. A lot of the Team Leaders do care about their immediate employees, but management can override that pretty quickly.
