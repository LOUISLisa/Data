Do you want to? Urbane is seeking the most talented, driven, and intelligent in offensive and defensive security to join our Security Services teams to help secure the largest and most interesting organizations, platforms, and products in the world. From large-scale cloud platforms to the newest mobile applications; global financial processing to regional healthcare providers; cutting edge devops environments to traditional corporate enterprises - Urbane is called on to help organizations face unique, highly technical, and critical challenges. In this role you\u2019ll assess real-life risks to diverse technical environments by identifying security weaknesses, actively exploit their findings, and determine additional impact through post exploitation. Given your expertise and drive, you\u2019ll face diverse challenges including black box network testing, insider threat assessments, credentialed application exploitation, and testing the effectiveness of human and physical controls. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to excel independently while having an expert team drive you to achieve your best and back you up with the diverse challenges you\u2019ll face. Occasionally, and to keep things interesting, you\u2019ll switch sides to maintain a full perspective of the security landscape by providing guidance on defensive designs or assisting compliance associates on difficult technical choices. With Urbane you\u2019ll have the power to make a difference and face real challenges: improving environments security, advising teams on the most effective ways to address the core security problems, and address real security problems. Challenges vary week to week and provide a wealth of experience. Sound like an exciting challenge and a cause you can get behind? Read on. Who You Are You should possess the following key character traits: Creative, out-of-the-box thinker who can leverage various domains of knowledge to create uniquely tailored tests and solutions for complex problems. You\u2019re curious by nature, intrigued by how things work, and have an appetite to find weaknesses in their design and implementation. You prefer building, contributing, and leading over falling in line. You\u2019re happy to put in the extra effort building a tool that makes everyone\u2019s lives easier. Urbane team members value developing long-term client relationships over \u201cdrop the mic\u201d moments. You want to provide remediation suggestions that address the core issues, are sustainable, and work within the confines of the target environment. You\u2019re passionate about technology and find entertainment in crazy personal projects (i.e., programming a USB Nerf gun and webcam to mess with your cat while you aren\u2019t at home, building an enterprise-grade virtualization environment in your bedroom closet, or seeing how many neighbors think your \u201cfree\u201d wifi is actually \u201cfree\u201d). A desire to stay current with the latest technologies, attacks, and hardening strategies. You\u2019re a regular online reader of blogs and social media for the latest in security, enjoy good conference talks, and/or contribute to interesting projects. Driven personality, with a desire to continuously improve, put in the hours, and deliver. You take pride in your work, and you want it to be the best you can do. Not opposed to traveling and can survive occasions requiring Domestic/International travel (currently less than 25%, but subject to fluctuate). Highly organized and detail-oriented with the ability to independently prioritize multiple projects while still balancing personal goals. You recognize when you need help, and aren\u2019t afraid to ask for it. Have a strong ethical compass and an understanding of ethics in business and information security. You\u2019ll respect scope limitations, clean up after your attacks, and never access or retain data that isn\u2019t pertinent to the testing. Equally comfortable holding your own with a technical audience (especially the Unix-Beards) as well as communicating to a non-technical audience (including the C-Suite), both in writing and verbally. Maintain a unique and independent identity, but respect other business\u2019 culture, including dress apparel, level of formality, and work schedules. We maintain a startup-style culture internally, while presenting a clean, elevated, and refined image to the rest of the world. Currently a US citizen or other permanent US resident. What You Have Done We care more about knowledge drive over pieces of paper to serve as proof. As such, we\u2019re looking for the following: 1-3 years of experience in penetration testing, whether professional job, independent consulting, bug bounty, or capture the flag experiences. Legally, of course. Performed one or more of the following roles as a penetration tester: external network penetration testing, internal network penetration testing, wireless penetration testing, web application penetration testing, mobile application penetration testing, social engineering, non-destructive physical security testing. Gained a strong technical knowledge and understanding of mixed-technology environments, include diverse operating systems, network hardware, web application languages, administration technologies, authentication mechanisms, and cloud platforms. Extensively used open source penetration testing tools and frameworks, such as (but not limited to) Metasploit, Burp, Nmap, etc. Developed or modified tools in scripting languages, such as Ruby, Python, Perl, or Java, to assist in testing a problem. Learned the core fundamentals of computers, all the way down to protocol stacks. Paid enough attention in English class to write good (or is it well?) and know to self-QA deliverables before sending them to others. What We Prefer (but do not require) Are active in industry groups (e.g., OWASP, DEF CON Groups, City-Sec Meetups, or other security meetups) and/or conferences (e.g., DEFCON, ShmooCon, Summercon, DerbyCon, THOTCON, BSides, BlackHat, etc.). College or equivalent educational experience. Have fun acronyms after your name, such as OSCP, OSWP, GPEN, GWAPT, CPTE, CISSP, or are not opposed to getting them as needed. Experience in modifying or creating tools or payloads to exploit vulnerabilities not effectively covered in other exploitation frameworks. Have performed independent research, testing, or tool development on security issues out of curiosity. Located in Chicago-land area or open to relocation, but willing to accept the right candidates across the US. You prefer the words \u201cinformation security\u201d or \u201ccomputer security\u201d over \u201ccyber\u201d. Who Is Urbane?
