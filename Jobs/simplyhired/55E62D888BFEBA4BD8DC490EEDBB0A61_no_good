With leading sustainable brands including Komodo, Rotholz and Phyne, Staiy is focused on curating the finest selection of sustainable brands and styles available online. For Staiy\u2019s founders, sustainability is not a trend. Rather it is the ethical foundation underpinning the lifestyle of the future, which they want to spread through their platform.
