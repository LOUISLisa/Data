Welcome to the machine Chewy deceivingly portrays themselves as a company that truly cares about their employees and is willing to invest in individual, professional growth however this couldn't be further from the truth. The sad reality is that this company places profit above all else resulting in an employee mill, constantly churning out mindless slaves, thus sustaining the myriad of problems they exhibit at this fulfillment center such as extremely high turnover, minimal chance of advancement, low pay for high expectations, safety violations, and an overall depressing experience. First off, the pay rate of $15.75 that they are currently advertising is false. What they fail to mention is that this rate is for the \"high demand\" shifts, a.k.a the shifts that most people don't want to do such as overnight on the weekends, ruling out most people that want a regular work shift to accommodate children, or school, etc. The deception does not end there. When you apply for a position such as \"Forklift Operator\", do not expect to actually do that for at least a couple of months after starting. Most new employees start out \"mutli-picking\" in Outbound for the first 30 days of employment. You will need to take it upon yourself to remind the inept \"management\" to push to get you trained on the equipment necessary to perform the job you applied for. Personally it took 9 months doing various other jobs after \"multi-picking\", such as \"singles pack\" and loading trailers on the shipping dock, before getti...more 4.0 Customer Service Representative | Louisville, KY | Apr 5, 2019 Louisville Chewy So I'm going to start from the very beginning up to current employment with Chewy. I found the Chewy CSR pharmacy technician position on indeed and walked in as they were doing open interviews. I had an interview on the spot and was offered the job. You are required to drug test and have a background test. I'm guessing as many people who work for Chewy smoke marijuana, that chewy is a THC friendly company as long as you're a responsible adult and do not come to work high or smelling of pot. I have a clean background so I'm not sure if they are background friendly or not. The base pay coming in is $13.50 which I would say is pretty good pay for such a simple job. Once you are offered the position (which can take some time, my background check took almost 3 weeks due to some issues with miscommunication about a name change), you will have a week of training. A lot of the training is shadowing current agents with time spent in the training room learning. Pay attention to everything and take notes if you're not the type to retain very well. Ask tons of questions. Your last day of training is throwing you to the sharks. You are out on the floor, usually placed near stronger agents who can help at any point. 95% of the agents are friendly and will help if you have a question. In training they will explain your benefits package (health, dental, vision, 401k, etc). Coming in, you will not know what schedule you will be working until the latter part of your training week. If the sch...more ProsFree catering, easy, laid back, benefits, tons of overtime ConsShort lunch, desk sharing, bugs 1.0 Fulfillment Associate | Ocala, FL | May 23, 2020 Golden apple at first but turned to ash the moment i tasted it...... Before i start this review is mainly directed at receiving and HR, more so towards the former. At first I was extremely excited after the interviewing process which showed the very clean and organized warehouse. There was a flow there which i haven't seen before and with nearly 7-8 years working warehouse its an extreme rarity. The interviewing process left me feeling excited and proud to soon to be working along with such positive people in a pristine workplace. However i didn't take notice of the actual workers on the reach trucks, and mini scooters, or in receiving and shipping. I didn't notice the exhausted anger sad and overall morose faces of all the bottom of the totem pole workers. That was the first warning sign to stay away but i ignored it because i had the naive notion \"I'd do better\" or \"it'll be better\" since i was so impressed by the warehouse's appearance. Now to quickly cover the following month before my first ever injury on the job which lead me to see the real arrogance and extreme prejudice this company's employees exhibit mainly referring to the leads, manager and supervisors as well as all of HR and the so called double face \"safety team\" as well as some employees who are befriended by those i mention. The first month was amazing due to my rose tinned glasses. I excelled quickly by being crossed trained on several machine such as the reach truck and a few scanners and several areas all around receiving. I had a wonderful beginning relations with managem...more 4.0 Fulfillment Associate | Dallas, TX | Aug 22, 2019 Good pay, Decent hours, Too many employees, management is partial (speaking for the Dallas fulfillment center) You have to tough it out through the interview process, get there EARLY like a hour early. the line gets very long and they only have a limited amount of hire spots to give out on any given event. so you could wait for 5 hrs to get to the recruiter and find out they are turning you away because they are full. a friend of mine was told the ''system went down'' so they would call him back when really the recruiter marked him as a ''no hire'' so he had to wait 30 days before re-applying. it was a nightmare because he went to 3 diff hieing events just to find that out at the 3rd one that he wouldn't be hired. Starting pay is 14.00 per hour, they have a scale where you get a raise at 30 days,60,90,120 and a year markers. without getting any forklift license at your max year with your max raise i believe it was 17.30 per hour. forklift,cherry picker license class would give you a extra .40 cents on your current rate. They pay weekly via direct deposit, your first check is short a week, and your first check is a paper pickup one. There Order Selector, Packing, Shipping,Incoming Order Selector is where everyone generally starts, you get a wrist computer and a little cart trike thing and you get a cart with boxes and bar codes on them. you scan the cart, it tells you what aisle and bay to go to and how many of that item to get and what box to put it all in, then the next one, over and over until you get done and go take it to ...more 3.0 Customer Service Representative | Dallas, TX | Dec 6, 2019 Chewy's redeeming quality tends to be the people I'm going to make this review as honest and fair as possible. When I was first hired on at Chewy, it wasn't that long into the call center being open back in August 2018, so keep that in mind. Training: The training is fairly strict. If you miss a day, you have to start completely over and there's no guarantee you'll be hired again. There were tests you had to take and lots of information to take in, but it doesn't prepare you 100% for what it's like on the floor. It's more intimate and you can build some relationships during this, but it's harder once you're on the phones. It can be a pretty fun environment and I enjoyed it. On the floor: I was only on phones for 2 weeks before being promoted. This was when there were fewer people on the email team and the chat team was only recently formed, so don't get your hopes up on moving. The email team still has to answer calls if there's overflow, but the chat team is exempt since the conversations are live. Make sure you make your goals known, that way they are taken into account. The calls are pretty back to back and there's a fairly high volume of live conversations, so on calls and chats, there isn't much time to get bored. Pros: - Customers are generally nice and appreciative - Insurance benefits - Getting to see people's cute pet pictures or hearing cute pet stories - Happy hour every other Friday, and you'll have a happy hour land on your training \"graduation\". You can also drink at your desk during happy ...more 1.0 Equipment Operator | Mechanicsburg, PA | Aug 4, 2017 They take more, want more, but give you less than ever. Then kick you. Once you have been there for awhile you will see the terrible lack of empathy and appreciation chewy has for its employees. Pay cap after 2 years of service, You get 1$ more at .50 cents a year. No 401K match. No profit sharing. Health benefits are free but bad to say the least, payed for benefits are not much better. Breaks are short because of their view on what a break is, and they will write you up for it and fire you over being late, even for a couple mins. At the same time it's ok to talk about sports with a manager for 20mins(favoritism). Most chaotic and dangerous place i have ever worked or seen. Always and injury or a accident weekly. Forklifts and foot traffic are working in the same space all day. I mean like within 1 foot of each other. Very little PIT or PPE (including fall arrester and harness for lifts) would pass a real inspection most is damaged or is ripped. They just this year(2017) went around and just wrote on the empty inspection tags that they were inspected and passed. Torn and ripped harness and fall arresters pass??? Did I mention that this equipment as been in use since as early as 2014. This all shows how much Chewy really cares about saving a few bucks over real employee safety. There is no room for you to move up unless you want to play their games and be a yes man. Oh and the security they have there isn't for your safety or to stop theft. It's there to make sure you can't take pictures of their horrible work place. Ther...more ProsSomeday you won't work there. ConsHearing \"SAFTEY FIRST\" every day. 5.0 Specialist | Clayton, IN | Jun 7, 2016 Fast Growing, Innovative, Rewarding and Fun The people who work here are awesome, talented and innovative, respected and respectful, decent and a hard/smart working group. Though not all suggestions are taken as a whole and ran with (unless they are REALLY awesome which is rare - cmon, you know that's true), a collective of similar suggestions from you and your team to solve issues are often pieced together to come up with an equitable solution, which benefits the process and the people who perform it. This really builds a sense of community and teamwork for those who care about what they do here. On the flip side...if you are the type of person who requires more than your good work to speak for itself, if you require praise for everything you do to gratify and/or glorify yourself and if you use these as measures of your self worth, you should apply elsewhere because Chewy will not coddle you and will not build on falseness. Now this doesn't mean Chewy won't recognize good work, but don't expect to get praise, raises or promotions by just being present and doing your minimum assigned task - no one is \"entitled\" to anything and everything is earned. Just as longevity and seniority are not (or are very small) factors to promotion at Chewy, you keep what you earn. You will earn everything from praise to criticism and how you react to both is a measure of character as it should be; humility and openness to feedback are necessary for your success at Chewy (or any job for that matter).

ConsBreaks are short, but it makes the day feel short too so its a wash. 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Hollywood, FL | Jul 16, 2018 Toxic company culture, apply at your own risk I've worked at this company for 2+ years as a CSR. Chewy has gotten larger since I've started and is still growing at this rate. Seeing their commercials now make my stomach violently turn. That being said, when you're dealing with a \"start-up\" you have to deal with the constant changes. The reasoning ends there however. Never have I dealt with such incompetent \"trainers\" and \"management\" (millenials with no experience) leading this company as they have no clue what's going on and will only feed you lies. Every change that occurs is vaguely mentioned and that's only after they hold you accountable. Their company culture is very toxic and what they feed you at training is a stone cold lie. I've worked a variety of jobs before Chewy and still somehow bought into their fakeness. I started as a very happy individual and it left me nothing but a shell of my former self in the end. I had a nervous breakdown near the end and had to quit as I couldn't take it anymore. I was so unhappy. There are NO raises and no opportunities (UNLESS you're a HUGE BROWN NOSER) as this place only rewards throwing people under the bus. They will say one thing and then do another..Just really unorganized chaos and unprofessionalism all across the board. I've made great marks as a CSR as I had everything down pat and they still wouldn't provide me the opportunity to just make a LATERAL move. That's it, I wasn't even asking for a raise and they still denied me while they gave me a differen...more ProsOccasional freebies, if you get to get away from the phones in the right moment ConsShort breaks, toxic company culture, unprofessional management, GENERIC CALL CENTER, no raises, disorganization 2.0 Pharmacy Technician | Louisville, KY | Aug 6, 2019 Don't Waste Your Time When I first started at Chewy early this year, it really felt like a place to call home, which is what was stressed in the training. Everyone LOVED their job at Chewy. When you first hit the floor, you did a little bit of everything until you found your niche and were put on a team. The teams had specific things they would do all day, and it played to their associates strengths. For example, if you were good at inputting faxes, you were on the fax team, etc. Then they hired people in upper management who didn't care about the people. They cared about numbers. And that's when it all started to change. You got in trouble for talking (I remember a specific incident where my desk neighbor, who was new on the floor, asked me for help on an order, which we are encouraged to do, and I got scolded for \"not focusing on my work\"). Employees became nothing but numbers. They move your seat CONSTANTLY for no reason. They cutely call it the \"Chewy Shuffle\", but it makes no sense. It annoys everyone because you usually end up sitting right back where you were before they decided to move you. It also contributes to the disgusting bed bug situation they've had off and on since LAST fall. There was a point where it got so bad people were missing work because they were worried they would contract the bedbugs and bring them in their home (which was not excused). We were also told to not talk about it or we would be disciplined. There are really no ways to advance other than getting int...more 3.0 Customer Service Representative | Dallas, TX | Jan 6, 2019 It's lovely, I'm just not the right person for the job. My typical day for my 8-4:30 shift is waking up at five am. My commute is an hour there, maybe more so I have to leave early just to make sure I'm not a minute late. Not too bad, my mom did it for years and Chewy is pretty strict on punctuality. So I get in, they have an amazing coffee machine, a nice little break room. The break room is the only place in the call center you can have your cell phone, which is good. Security for customer's credit cards, you know. Then you hit the floor, and I should've asked this in the interview what calls were like. Because they were non stop, you have to maintain the pace. You can never put a customer on hold, you have to keep talking to them and notating as you're trying to assist them. The moment you're out of training, you're on your own. It's a never ending onslaught of calls, and no breaks until you're designated 15s or your 30. I get they don't want customers on hold because it's annoying but the never ending slew of calls is so taxing. If you're not prepared to answer calls and manage everything entirely on your own first day out of your training period when it feels like a mad dash just to try and get everything done, then this likely isn't for you. I thought I could personally handle it, but everyday I'm waking with a knot in my stomach. I cry on my way to work and sit in my car before I have to go in and just debate going home. Because is it worth it? The strain on my mental health is already overwhelming.

News flash it's not! You aint got that type of security at Walgreens Answered Oct 21, 2019 Mouth swabs are taken at hiring and at random, but only hard drugs other than weed are penalized. They recently fired a large group of people for weed use and hired them back due to such a large number of employees using it. Answered Aug 21, 2019 If you were in charge, what would you do to make Chewy a better place to work? Asked Aug 13, 2017 You should give everyone a chance just crossed them off the list if there a no show save you time and money point blank Answered Feb 14, 2020 Listen to your employees, we have great ideas. If you would pay by performance and work ethic, it would encourage people to try harder. Hire people that know how to do that job, not outside college grads that have no idea what a warehouse job is. More praise instead of just telling at us when we make an error. Chewy will fail if you don't get out in the warehouse and see what is going on. Answered Feb 7, 2020 What is the work environment and culture like at Chewy? Asked Mar 16, 2017 This place is horrible. So many cliques but I didn't care because I would slap all of em simultaneously. They have the weirdest off the wall people I've ever encountered. There are so many tatted freaks and homos in charge it's like a circus. Answered Oct 21, 2019 This place is absolutely Awful!

Asked Apr 20, 2017 In Reno it was urine for me and another friend on 12/12/19. 5 panel, including Marijuana. However this marijuana testing BS ends in a little over two weeks in the State of Nevada! The only exception is if you are tested for federal positions or positions where safety is a concern such as driving. But yeah... Next month it will be a 4 panel test, not 5.
