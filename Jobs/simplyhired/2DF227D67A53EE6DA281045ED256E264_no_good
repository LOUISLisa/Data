Working at [the project Portal site]... has changed my life, and speaking to hundreds of people from all around the world about their stories, passions, fears, hopes, and dreams has been so inspiring. I feel so grateful for all of those conversations, and I can now say that the power of the portal is truly magical. I\u2019ve seen people cry, dance, sing, confess, argue, reunite, smile, laugh, and much much more. I\u2019ve also watched the hard-working, determined, and compassionate team set an example for myself, and others, and I\u2019m so glad I was able to be a part of something so wonderful. \" Sophie Champ, Summer Intern 2019, BS Industrial and Systems Engineering at Lehigh University About Shared_Studios We bring together people separated by distance and difference to talk, dance, play and collaborate via Portals: immersive audio-visual environments in public spaces such as schools, parks, tech hubs, refugee camps and universities.

We give people everywhere a chance to tell their own story, to explore the diversity of human experience, and to connect with people unlike themselves as if they were in the same room.
