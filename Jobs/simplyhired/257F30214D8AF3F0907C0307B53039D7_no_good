Was a great group of people. I learned a lot working with all of the people here. Learning then teaching people how to do new things was my favorite part of the job. ProsPaid lunches ConsGetting laid off 3.0 Equipment Operator | Baytown, TX | Jan 26, 2018 Mechanic Great teachers for mechanics. There were some management and ap issues. Drove to each work site to fix equipment as needed. The main office in beamount. 3.0 Processing Geophysicist | Houston, TX | May 31, 2016 Good Working here was okay. Nothing major, just a job.. Management was good, not sure what to say about the rest.. Overall, everything was okay. 4.0 Data Processor | Houston, TX | Sep 19, 2014 Good company A typical day is spent looking at domestic and international mud oil and gas logs and identifying them. 99.9% of the time is spent sitting down and manipulating two computer screens. ProsGreat bonuses, breaks. 3.0 Equipment Operator | Texas | Jul 16, 2012 Good Job like what I do, would like to have more pay for the job that I do. Maintenance railroad Track for Dupont Plant as the backhoe operator. Safety while with working on railroad tracks, laying the tracks out everyone works as a team to get the job completed working in the heat getting off Prosenjoy working with heavy equitment Consdistance to job site 2.0 Responsable des OpÃ©rations (H/F) | Delaware | Jun 8, 2017 On est plus sur la mÃªme page Bonjour, Malheureusement ma philosophie et celle de ma supÃ©rieure immÃ©diate ne concore plus. Mon approche est plus axÃ©e sur la satisfaction du client vu que c'est notre centre d'intÃ©rÃªt alors que elle, c'est plus concentrÃ© sur ses intÃ©rÃªts personnels et sur son clan d'amies donc tres subjective et self centered et la je vois clairement que vu qu'elle est a ce poste depuis des annÃ©es et qu'il n'ya rien a faire c'est de me trouver un endroit ou j'evolue tant sur le plan professionnel que personnel et la ou l'esprit d'Ã©quipe et la base pour maxiser le rendement de chacun et ou l'Ã©quitÃ© et la justice raigne pour Ãªtre heureux au travail car nous passons quand meme presque toute une journÃ©e au travail donc Ãªtre heureux et Ãªtre fiÃ¨re de faire partie d'une equipe est important a mon avis. Prosj'adore la communication avec mes differents clients ConsAtmosphere nÃ©faste, pas le droit de donner son opinion donc pas d'ouverture de communication = pas d'Ã©volution = negatif 3.0 Field Engineer | Houston, TX | Nov 2, 2015 structure My biggest issue with this company was structure. It had relatively none. I was asked to create the survey department for which i was uniquely qualified to do however i received little to no support in doing so. I took up the reigns and still managed to build the department however without having a good support structure provided by management, keeping things running smoothly was very hard. Creating a structure where employees were not running around without direction or with direction coming from too many sources.Making these changes proved difficult and often times impossible to succeed. 2.0 Technician | Houston, TX | Jun 7, 2013 Dead End Company equals dead end career There is no moving up in jib position here. These folks dont even give you a raise. I was a well header tech and i hated it. How about upper management are messy, even the head HR lady is a messy pig. mostly asians and spanish people working there and 9 times out of 10 you gotta know someone to get in there. The pay is poor the vibe is hottible and this is all at the North Houston location Prosprofit sharing Consworking there islike you are working at a never ending story Questions And Answers about TGS How do you feel about the future of TGS?
