CA Overall Reviews at Lyft 3.0 Driver | Tallahassee, FL | Jun 17, 2019 Part time? YES! Full time? NO! Drive at your own risk While I do appreciate having this as an option for income until I figure out my next move I do want to pass along a few insights to anyone considering this as a career. Drive at your own risk. If you decide you want to make this your full time gig, understand you are basically out there on your own. Lyft support is hard to get a hold of and they take a day to respond. If you have an issue with the app they are not going to help you. You\u2019ll get a generic response to any issue you try to bring up. I\u2019ve had issues several times with the app crashing and after it crashing so many times I receive an automated text message saying \u201cYou\u2019re closing the app to avoid getting ride requests. If it\u2019s not a good time to drive just go offline. Closing the app to avoid requests hurts your acceptance rate.\u201d So of course I was upset seeing this message when I know good and well I\u2019m trying to earn money and it\u2019s the company app that keeps crashing and is hurting MY acceptance rate and MY time and MY money. When I reached out I got a generic response telling me to try resetting my device or delete the app and try to download it again. Really? Like I couldn\u2019t have thought of that myself? So I think that\u2019s really messed up that my money was affected negatively due to their app being glitchy. And let me just say it glitches about half the time. Seriously read what I\u2019m saying and consider how frustrated you might be if you\u2019re out there driving around wondering why you\u2019re not gett...more 1.0 Independent Contractor | Phoenix, AZ | Aug 11, 2019 Horrible company that no longer cares about people..only money they can make to look good to the shareholders ever since they went public. The week (end of July 2019), before I quit (using Express Drive) after working for 5 years, full-time for Lyft, I actually lost $100.00 working 30 hours in Phoenix Arizona. After working for 30 hours, to pay the $260.00 rental cost, I still own 39 cents that they took out of my checking account, after I spent over $100.00 in gas working for free like a slave, or actually worse as slaves did not pay their owners to work for them, and they at least were given free room and board. This was the same week as Lyft (unbeknownst to the drivers) added an option in their app in 4, Phoenix Arizona cities to have Waymo (automated driver car with a driver supervising the driving) to actually compete with all of the human drivers in the area (which is what is obviously coming). Lyft saturates the areas with no limit to drivers, making it harder for full-time drivers to compete. They overcharge on the Hertz car rentals, and dropped the driver's income rate from .52 cents a mile, to .48 cents a mile because of \"higher insurance costs\", since Hertz just can't make enough money charging more than one thousand dollars a month for the car, which is less than they charge their regular customers. If gas prices go up, the driver is stuck with the higher cost of gas, which they pay at least $100.00 a week to keep running. Lots of price gouging. The last straw was when my rental malfunctioned (the engine light kept coming on and car starting running very rough, which will get drivers low ratin...more ProsCan work your own hours ConsWorking for free for 4 days to pay for Express Drive, getting checking account robbed, long hours, no health insurance and no income if you have to quit after losing money working for them. 4.0 Driver (Independent Contractor) | Orange County, CA | Apr 3, 2019 An App is your Boss welcome to the future! Lyft is my first APP based job. I like the flexibility and the APP is well designed and they are making ongoing improvements based on user feedback. What you need to know, the cost involved with driving full time do not earn enough to cover rent/car payment. Your gas factor is huge investment. I have found that for every $100, take off $40-52 for daily gas used. Gas prices jumped .70 cents in one week. So your daily pay drops significantly. In my area Toll fees are another crusher, the app provides a preferred route, I am not always in a familiar area to avoid the tolls and use the preferred Route, resulting in weekly tolls averaging $48. Yes you are reimbursed but this is still part of the $100 equation, and you are responsible for paying your toll account. so now your $100 less gas and tolls for the day result in $36 net for the day. So if you stopped for lunch there goes another $20. I have given over 900 rides to give this a genuine test run to see if I could pay my main bills. The answer is no. So yes great for supplement if your in a busy area, events you can make extra money. You should look at its as supplemental income and maintain a foundational base for monthly income needs. As far as direct contact with Lyft on any level, there's not much interaction. If you have an issue the key is to contact support at the moment, there are times when calling the line is too busy, keep calling until you reach live person, its is imperative to resolve any issue ...more Prosdaily pay ConsGas prices, supplemental income not good for full time wage, you are not going to stay in your area 1.0 Driver (Independent Contractor) | Minneapolis-Saint Paul, MN | Feb 17, 2020 $22ph before expenses, after $12ph 5 star rating for a year 1000+ rides I loved working for myself and adored my customers! Lyft as a company was popular since it wasn't uber now they're copying them in every way i.e not giving a f*ck about you as a driver, car or human being. If you get in an accident (crashed into) their \"million dollar coverage\" only applies if: -You're in the accident with the passenger in the car (happened to me awkward af) not online, not in-route to them but with... (assuming that's the case) -Now you report it and they deactivate your account immediately! (i.e. fired with a crashed car) -Guess what? To be covered by their insurance you need to pay a $2,500 out of pocket copay YOU DO! -The help line said talk to the insurance adjuster to have your account reactivated, I did. -The insurance adjuster said; \"yeah we don't do that at all they keep telling people we do but we have absolutely no ability to do that\" -They assessed based on the photos I sent that it was less than $2,500 to repair from the pictures but then said I need to send 4 more (they want to see if my car looked good enough for their standards to reactivate my account) I.e. magically come up with the money after they fire you to fix your own car that wouldn't have been in an accident in the 1st place had you not been working for them. 24/7 help line? you have to sort through about 6 pages of certain options to even be allowed to call them, otherwise you can send an email and they'll regurgitate the same article on the website back to you 3 ...more 1.0 Driver | Salt Lake City, UT | Mar 1, 2018 I was a 4.9 Star Driver and HA Pink Stach I write this review not to slam the company but to warn prospective driver to be aware. I will only write the facts. 1. You are a 1099 contracted person NOT AN EMPLOYEE. All income you receive MUST be reported on your taxes. You have no benifits PERIOD> 2. You use your own car pay all fuel costs, no maintenance reimbursements, nothing . The fact is you work for an APPLICATION. 3. You sign a contract stating you are responsible for everything and you have to have proof of insurance. I made sure I had a 1 Million dollar umbrella policy for my own protection. 4. No training period you need to learn how to do rides based on a video. Knowledge of your area (all Bars), airport schedules, and event in you area (conventions ect). 5. Safety you really are on your own picking up people in dark area's, sketchy parts of town, and really vulnerable to physical harm. More incidents happen than what are reported because driver don't want BAD rating. 6. Chasing the Surge- this is when demand for rides is more than cars available and YOUR APP will highlight those area's. It's like fish bait to a driver THE APP highlights those area's and if you are in the location you MIGHT get a ride. Mostly what happens is driver rush to the area's and customer wait until surge is over to call. So like fish running to fish bait you will get a ride maybe surge. NO Guarantee. 7.

All Risk 1.0 Driver (Independent Contractor) | Des Moines, IA | Aug 19, 2018 Not interested in driver input or satisfaction lyft will deactivate you on a moment's notice & the notice you get letting you know your account is deactivated is ALWAYS CONDESCENDING and lays the blame at the DRIVERS feet! Whether it's a GPS issue.. (ALWAYS says it's a spoofing problem)! They'll claim it's the phone you are using and SUGGEST you upgrade to a newer phone, (even though mine is an Android 7 & is supposed to be compatible with the app) or a customers review WITHOUT REQUESTING any info about the situation from the driver!!! The driver is ALWAYS guilty without benefit of both sides of the story... a customer was so drunk, he couldn't locate his own shoes in a one room loft apt he'd been \"partying\" at so got in my car without his shoes; he then turned me into the safety team alleging that I was driving under \"the influence of an unknown substance\", (definately untrue), so they deactivated me for several days without having any other input from myself or previous fares! There are also instances of unfair reviews by customers that are also taken at face value by Lyft without benefit of disputing what the customer claims... good example of this would be a customer who gave me a less than 3 rating because they had to \"walk more than a mile to the pick up!\" & I will admit they may have had to walk possibly a half mile in distance to reach me, however, what they didn't include in their review was that I was parked in the ASSIGNED TAXI/RIDE SHARE PICK UP zone that the IOWA STATE FAIR requires ALL rideshare companies u...more Prosset your own hours Consevery thing else except setting your own hours 1.0 Driver (Independent Contractor) | Pittsburgh, PA | Jan 12, 2019 Lyft Express Driver in Pittsburgh PA. ( HORRIBLE ) ONE star because YELP made me!!! I would give you guys a Double -0 rating. So Ive been a LYFT EXPRESS DRIVER since OCTOBER 2018... The program seemed great at first, one they offer you a rental car with HERTZ you can use for making money and as personal. You do not have to worry about maintenance because the Pep Boys takes care of all of it!! Sounds Great Right! Not!!!! The rental is $289.66 every single Monday!!! That's not even real Hertz weekly rental prices.... Then they give you these Peak time rental reward ride requirements thats absolutely impossible to meet. You have to have a 20 ride requirement every week to continue driving the car. My problem is there are nooooo rides here in PITTSBURGH, PA!!! I was online for 4 hours and i didnt get not one ride. I dumped $50 worth of gas in my car which btw only takes $25 to fill the tank.. Not one ride.. I called lyft and explain there is no demand.. A Manager said and i Quote \" There are more drivers on the road then there are Riders\" How is that even possible!! Im a full time.driver i can barely meet the $289.66 every week because there is no rides!!! I cash out at the end of the week $50-$70 in my pocket because LYFT platform makes sure you can earn the cost of that rental..

You are presented with ride requests in which you are told an estimated time to arrive at the passenger\u2019s location, and the name of the passenger. You are not provided any essential details of the job such as where the destination is, however once you accept the job, you are obliged to complete it. Passengers are given the option to rate their rides and write a review, a review which is an essential part of your permission to participate in the platform. This essentially means that should your rating fall below regional thresholds (based on the cumulative average rating of others in your region) you may be removed from the platform based on a negative review or a safety concern a passenger has. Some passengers take advantage of this, making false claims in hopes of gaining refunds and credit for their future rides. Generally this gives the passenger full autonomy over the route taken. Decisions such as what is played on the radio, climate control settings, whether to have a window down (on the freeway on a rainy day for instance) are decisions for the passenger to make, as the passengers have the authority to rate you off the platform. There is a prolific problem of passengers making new accounts once they become delinquent in payment or should they be kicked due to assault or unsafe behaviour while in a ride. Passengers are not authenticated with the same level of scrutiny that a driver i...more 1.0 Owner Operator Driver | Indianapolis, IN | Sep 17, 2019 Costing more than I can make. Half the money I make goes back into gas every day. Today I worked 7 hour made $60 and spent $50 refilling the gas tank. It is getting harder every day to make money. Too many drivers. Over saturated market !!! I had a pickup at the zoo and the guy said thank god your American, Said I was the third driver they called because the first two didn't speak English. Damage to inside of vehicle Lyft can't pay for, because I have no ides what passenger broke the seat belt, tore the trim off the bottom of the seat ... Some times you get another ride before your finished with the ride your giving at the moment. weather you want it or not. When a ride come up in the app you only have 5 sec. to accept it. The only way to not accept it is to let the 5 sec. expire, then you are penalized for it. I had ride's that the pick up was in a dead end ally with no lights. Cancelled that ride and got out of there. And when you cancel the ride there is only one reason \"Ride to far away\". You can not put in a explanation \"Passenger start cussing me the moment they open the door\", \"They try to rob me\", Yes had to one happen, I carry my gun at all times I driving for lyft. And people will order a regular lyft and have 6 or 7 passengers to keep from paying for the lyft XL because it cost 1.5 times the price of a regular lyft ride. Had that happen.

LOVE it. ð Answered Jun 24, 2020 What tips or advice would you give to someone interviewing at Lyft? Asked Dec 31, 2018 It is production based so please don't expect hourly wages Answered Mar 4, 2020 You don't interview. Everything is done online. Answered Mar 4, 2020 Do Lyft drivers make more during certain times of the day? Asked Jan 16, 2016 I have found that in Chicago and surrounding areas you can make between $15.00 and $20.00 per hour not including drive time back home. The biggest problem drivers face is going way out somewhere you don't want to be at the wrong time and driving back to a hotter area. There is a \"destination mode\" that you can use to alert Lyft you are only going one direction and they will try to get you a ride. 50% of the time it works. You can make a living. Usually 3 hour blocks of time are best to keep it fresh.
