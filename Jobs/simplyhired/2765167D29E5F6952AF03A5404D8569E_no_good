BSW policy is you must be in a position for 6 months in order to apply for a transfer. I get that this is to prevent someone for moving around all the time but there are times when you move into a new position and know it just isn't the right fit for you from the start. Being a provider this is extremely important to me as this is my CAREER not just a job until I get out of school. You would think that an organization that has spent upward of 10K or more training you that they would want you to be happy and keep you in the system. So when you voice that this was the wrong decision they should allow for leverage of this policy. Our management, in my new position, obviously does not. My old manager would have worked with me as she understand retention and this is a career and not just a job. Also if you are thinking of becoming a midlevel at BSW think about this very closely.......you have to give 3 months...YES I SAID THREE MONTHS... notice of you leaving your position in order to be rehired there and to have your PTO that is left in your account paid out to you!!! This is the worse policy that I have ever seen. Most outside contracts do not have this long of a leave notice. It is as if they are saying if you leave don't think of coming back. Most employers out there want you to start sooner than 3 months. There defense is it will take that long for crediting but that is incorrect and ...more Prossalary is decent and benefits for midlevels is really good Consleave of position and transfer of position policy for midlevels 4.0 Registered Nurse | Carrollton, TX | Sep 20, 2012 See below I work on a wondeful PP, GYN, Ante floor. I would say these are the best nurses that I have worked with--teamwork, attitude, and work ethic. I am very happy here, and I would not consider leaving--only thatI wish to find a position in the Denver area to be near my daughters and their families. A typical day at work is challenging. We have no support staff (unit secretary, techs etc.) therefore we do everything from patient, family care to emptying the trash. I love my patients. They are very diversified, from culture to individual taste. I like that. I have learned so much. We use the language line when necessary, and it is so rewarding to see the smiles on my patients faces when they understand the extent of my care. I try to meet my patients where \"they are\" and give them my total attention. Patient care is my HEART. Management is hard! They are constantly asking more of us that has nothing to do with patient care. I struggle with this at times, because the goals seem to emphasize more corporate ideas than nurses ideas. But I comply, because my job requires that I do. The hardest thing about my job, is that our unit (always staffed) has had to float to the med surge units, ICU, and ER. I never mind the patients, I just fill that we have become the \"float pool\". Without a doubt the most enjoyable part of my job is feeling and knowing that I have met the needs of my patients and their families. You can not put a price tag on that!!! We have nurse-to-nurse report at the bedsid...more Prosreputation of baylor. Consthe disconnect between corporate and employees 5.0 Patient Care Technician | Texas | Apr 12, 2017 Great workplace but be mindful of the position you choose! I applied for what seemed like six straight months before getting a job offer at Scott & White. I had gotten loads of interviews but no dice when it came to an offer. I'm a Registered Medical Assistant with both externship and volunteer experience and only ended up getting offered a position as a Patient Care Technician. I was excited but listen, don't do what I did. If you are overqualified in any way, shape, or form, do not work as a PCT. You're a CNA and if you don't want to stand on your feet for 12 hours with only a 30 minute lunch break, then this won't be the right fit for you. I lasted three months before I left. You're changing patients, helping them walk if needed, and everything else in between which includes peri care and the like. Although this is a needed profession, it is hard on your body. If you aren't doing this as a stepping stone into nursing, don't waste your time. If you are a phlebotomist or a CMA or anything else, don't settle for being a PCT/CNA just to get your foot in the door because it is physically demanding and there is no guarantee that you'll ever get transferred anytime soon, meanwhile you're out there breaking your back. There were CNAs I worked with who were doing their jobs from 5 years all the way up to 20 years of experience. Guess what? They all had knee, back, or some sort of longstanding body injury that was caused by the intense physical demands of their job. All for a PCT salary. They did pay well, I was considered inexperienced so ...more ProsCoworkers, Everything really ConsPhysically demanding 4.0 Medical Assistant | Marble Falls, TX | Jan 10, 2017 overall good experience I enjoyed working for Scott & White and hope to return in the future. I felt that the \"higher-ups\" took good care of the nursing staff. At my previous job at another company, we wore many hats such as nursing staff, front desk staff, call center, janitor. At Scott and White, there was a cleaning crew, a call center and a full front desk staff. I was able to focus on just nursing duties. I would give management a 4 out of 5 stars because I did feel one of my managers was biased. I did bump heads with a RN who had more experience then me and that manager took her side of everything and made it seem like everything was my fault. My most recent supervisor was very fair and very attentive and easy to work with. Besides the one RN, the staff at Scott & White was excellent. We were like an extended family. I will truly miss working with them but I had to move on due to the commute and moving to a new city. The hardest part of the job and this probably happens everywhere; the RNs look down their noses at lower level nursing staff. Luckily, for me we didn't have many RNs and all the CMAs and LVNs were like a sisterhood. The part I enjoyed the most about the job was there was a clear job description for a CMA. We did not have to take phone calls all day long unless it was an emergency. The call center would make up a phone note and transfer it to nurse staff inbox. There was a janitorial service where you could call and someone would be there in minutes to help clean some...more Prosdiscount in cafteria & gift shop, teamwork orriented environment Consshort-ish lunchs, pay not so great 5.0 Analyst | United States | Sep 11, 2015 well paced workflow management and execution IMHO, self-driven performance and proper adherence to legacy protocol will receive the most appropriate recognition overall after the recent merger. pros-cons: highly productive environment encouraging a lot of forward thinking to produce rapid development successes however, seemed to be hedged against a disjointed, non-linear series of projection voids most closely associated with legacy overlay/rework paradigms. Management and the organization: Understandably, the tail will routinely wag the dog but, more often than not, there was a most remarkable exhilaration when the unplanned exception was handled flawlessly and, while it may not have been a specific requirement, it was something I felt the project leadership encouraged us to plan for and was given the resources to ensure it was tested before it went to production. Co-workers: An assortment of skills from all walks of life. The common thread in each is the pursuit of excellence and attention to detail that comes from dedication to high achievement. Would work with any/all of them again and would scoop them up in a heartbeat if they ever needed work....and after 3 years and high retention I can only conclude that the caliber of the team was defined by those who put it together. Bravo! Hardest part of the job for me: Deciding which roll the red tape comes from next and having to go home in the middle of writing some great code.

You basically had to report to these people that weren't the manager. If you told the manager something personal you best believe they knew it and they would play on it in others words use it against you. Listening to your conversations including professionals they would take the conversation and twist it bottom line if you didn't kiss up to them they would make sure the manager didn't like you and you will be called in the office everyday or every other day with real petty things like why aren't you using the a certain bathroom or why did you go to lunch and didn't sing happy birthday..Be careful of which HTPN facility you work for these people would find out personal things about you and start using it against you like what college you go to. Certain groups were treated better and if you talk to management about it next thing you know you are asked in a very very sweet and caring way to leave the department they would start saying things like \"would you like to work closer to home?\" As long as you allow certain groups to mistreat you nothing to good for you but the minute you stick up for yourself and say hey that is ...more ProsWork-Life Balance Consmessy coordinators influencing managers to believe untrue things about certain co-workers 3.0 Registered Nurse | Dallas, TX | May 27, 2020 Do not recommend for CVICU I left here a few months ago. I don't recommend working at the CVICU but the others are okay. The good: diverse and highly acute patient populations because they also do abdominal transplants on the CVICU for some reason. Central location. They have CNAs but none are proactive, so you just have to ask them to help you, you're expected to do stuff on your own and they're just an extra set of hands pretty much. They wont get people up without you. There are phlebotomists that get labs for you. The bad: 2:1 ratio almost always regardless of devices, people can be paired on CRRT--you could even have 2 at once, or a balloon pump in one room and a CRRT in the other...totally unsafe. The culture is that the nurse must be strong and not complain and just suck it up. One single provider for the 34 beds overnight. The assignments are usually such that they don't allow people to expand their skills, you could take a class on something like a balloon pump but not get one til 6 months later because they give these to the same nurses, so if you're a new hire or an outside hire regardless of your experience, you have about 6 months to a year before you actually get sick people. On the other hand, they'll routinely give you EXTREMELY busy 2:1s that should not be paired, should be 1:1, so your workload during the shift is usually very busy.No resource nurse, they try to get bare minimum staffing at all times as far as nurses go. The hospital is a private one and is very much money driven. ...more 2.0 Nuclear Medicine Technologist | Irving, TX | Jul 13, 2013 Watch your back, especially if you have experience Make sure you keep a log book at all times and document happenings in your work environment to protect yourself and record your accolades. Once you start receiving raises and become too expensive, they start searching for reasons to replace you with the students you've trained, as this is a teaching facility. Cover yourself and get to HR to report any strange happenings before a manager in your department has a chance to force you to quit so they can avoid paying you unemployment. Be ready to work very hard and learn a lot! I loved working with the patients and many of the staff. I developed a tremendous work ethic here and built a strong foundation of confidence to learn new things and work with a variety of people in a multitude of situations while working here. Work life balance was poor- at least for me. It seemed like everyone else was able to take vacations, then after I supported and dedicated myself to training the new staff after a couple of them had moved on, they did not appreciate my effort or understand why my nerves were shot after working 80 hrs a week doing so. They also did not understand me having to reassess and \"clean up\" what was left behind for me to decipher on record books. I was able to do so due to my ingenuity, dedication, and work ethic. Instead of being appreciated, I was made an object of ridicule and treated poorly. ProsThe patients are wonderful. I learned a tremendous amount working here, and for a time, had great coworkers. ConsWorked 80 hrs a week when we lost staff, had to train replacements, and never got a vacation. 1.0 Registered Nurse | Lakeway, TX | Feb 3, 2020 Do Not Work at the Lakeway, TX location! The BSW Lakeway Hospital is still trying to get away from the stigma associated with it's former name of Lakeway Regional Hospital. And the current \"manager\" of preop/pacu at the BSW Lakeway Surgery Center is not helping the case and needs to be removed immediately. You will have literally have PTSD after working with this person. It is seriously that bad, hence the sign-on bonus. The turmoil is not worth the pay. This \"manager\" has lost 8+ employees in the past year alone, and several more left before that once this person became the \"manager.\" There is high turnover here. Even employees wishing to transfer to another deparment/facility are never allowed to so they end up resigning. Everyone leaves because of issues with this person. Countless employees have reported this manager to HR but yet there is never any recourse, which is highly suspicious. This person likes to be called the \"Manager,\" but is actually the unit supervisor, is paid hourly, and is included in the nurse-to-patient census ratio but yet never helps the unit or takes patients. This person is an unfathomable micromanager who displays gross favoritism, lacks leadership and critical thinking skills, does not foster team work, keeps others down who excel and are professional threats to her, keeps a tally of any and all employee mishaps (even those benign and innocent in nature) and has misused them to fire employees at-will if they're not on the \"favorites\" list.
