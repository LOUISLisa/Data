But in today's world of SaaS outsourcing, complex supply chains, logistics partners, and multi-party relationships in every aspect of a company's business, that data no longer lives in one database or even inside a single company. Instead, it's spread across dozens, even hundreds, of disparate IT environments spanning companies, countries, cloud service providers, and legal and regulatory regimes. If that weren't challenging enough, this is happening at the very time that companies need access to timely, consistent, and complete business data like never before to power AI/ML, perform deep analytics, and optimize mission critical business costs. Vendia enables businesses to lower costs and optimize customer outcomes by restoring access to data and services regardless of where they live. Vendia's recreates the speed and ease of a conventional database through a novel and automatic decentralized platform that creates consistent, timely, and transactional access to data even when that data crosses clouds, regions, and owners. Unlike \"first gen\" blockchains that suffer from massive scalability limitations and fail to connect to enterprise systems, Vendia's technology integrates seamlessly into the enterprise with minimal disruption and scales to hundreds of thousands of transactions a second per chain, enabling it to power large, production workloads including high volume / low latency payments, mission critical logistics for complex discrete manufacturing, and tackling the hardest cross-cloud code sharing jobs through the world's simplest and most scalable approach to smart contracts. What We're Looking For As a startup, Vendia is looking for builders with deep distributed systems backgrounds. You should have deeply technical and repeated experience in designing, developing, deploying, and operating massive, multi-tenanted systems, preferably in a public cloud setting. Concepts like, \"adding 9's\" to the availability of a system, removing long-tail jitter, and creating continuous CI/CD pipelines protected by worldwide monitoring must be in your daily toolkit. You should obsess over customer experience in the form of production metrics and be able to rapidly craft production-grade features. Culturally, you are well-rounded: You enjoy working on a team but can also take a project from \"concept to customer meeting\" all by yourself. You don't need to be motivated by others to do your best. You can teach and learn from others. You hold yourself and those around you to the highest standards of customer success, production metrics, and legal and regulatory compliance, but you are also relentless self critical. You love all aspects of software development, but you are especially passionate about backend systems. Most importantly, you feel and act like an owner at all times - no job is too small, or too big, for you to help. About Us Founded in 2019, Vendia is a rapidly growing startup located in San Francisco and Seattle but serving the needs of enterprises around the globe. We embrace remote workers but also love interactive development. Our culture is dynamic, with a focus on rapid, iterative delivery and continuous learning from customer engagements. Most importantly, we are a \"succeed or fail together\" company - everyone here plays nicely with others and we value that as a key litmus test in job applicants. Sound interesting? Want to learn more? Let's Talk! Requirements 4 year undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Math, or similar subject area or equivalent accredited academic degree At least 5 years experience in a distributed engineering role with direct operational responsibility, preferably with public cloud focus Legal authorization to work in the US Preferred Characteristics Masters, PhD, or other advanced academic degree in Computer Science, Cryptography, or related areas Transparent work products, such as GitHub commits to a well-known open source project Willingness to engage in public speaking/events and perform customer demonstrations and training Prior experience at a startup or similar fast-paced environment Fluency in one or more foreign languages ",
