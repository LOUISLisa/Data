with a company that has a strong record of taking care of employees Prime facility is entirely proprietary and I am unable to submit a review with any specifics regarding the processes used. The compensation is average to good, benefits are above average, but the retirement compensation is excellent. Michelin is always contributing extra funds to the employee retirement fund. Put in enough years and you can enjoy a comfortable retirement. Michelin also has several rewards programs such as the Service Award where you receive a generous bonus to be used to buy tires from Michelin (also BFGoodrich and Uniroyal which are owned by Michelin). You can work there and never have to worry about your car's tires again, just the quest for the best bang for you're buck. You also can get 30% off tires at any time if you have used you're service award or not. Michelin compensates it's maintenance technicians according to their ranking. RT-1 (Reliability Technician) through RT-5, with RT-5 being comparable to engineer level of skill. Michelin sends it's employees to AP school where they learn skills and procedures. Once the classes required to advance have been passed, the employee takes a level assessment where if they pass they immediately receive a pay raise. Michelin also gives a cost of living raise at the beginning of each year which is usually fair, sometimes quite generous. Michelin maintenance employees are highly sought after by other manufacturing companies due to the high level of education and experience acquired. Most employees work a rota...more ProsGood benefits, great job security ConsLong 12 hour rotating shifts, the smell of rubber both cured and uncured 5.0 Material Handler | Sandy Springs, SC | Sep 23, 2017 Thank you Michelin Tire for taking a chance on me way back in 1978. In 1978 I was 28 years old and making $2.78 an hour working in the cotton mill in Greenwood, SC. I drove the 55 miles or so to Sandy Springs, SC to see if I could maybe get lucky and get a job with Michelin Tire. I say lucky mainly because at the time I really didn't know very much about the tire business. I did kind of think that Michelin tire would be a place where I could plan on working at for a very long time if they would only give me a chance to prove to them that it would be a good move to hire me for them and myself both. That was all that I needed for them to do for me. I spent 35 years working at Michelin until I retired about 3 years ago and I don't regret one second of the time that I worked with them. Oh sure working swing shifts for that long was a little hard at times but that's the way life is no matter where a person works if you have to work hard. Yes the work was hard at times but the rewards were worth it without a doubt. I was for sure blessed to have spent those years working for a great company like Michelin all those years. I met and still are friends with a lot of great people that shared those years along side me at work and also at play when we weren't working on our time off together. Michelin allowed me to get from $2.78 cent an hour at 28 years of age to I think around $27 dollars an hour when I retired 3 or 4 years ago. With only a high school education and 4 years in the Navy I think that was a great place and way to make a living for myself....more ProsGreat pay, great benefits, a family environment with great people to work with and for. Consswing shift, pretty dirty at times on some jobs 4.0 Regional Sales Manager | Cleveland, OH | Nov 22, 2016 Great Corporation to Work For During my tenure, I must say that Michelin is a great company to work for. As an Area Sales Manager, your success will be do in part to your desire to work in sales. Many of the tools are provided for one to assess their territory, however, additional training can be done to help with the effective use (working with longer tenured ASM, more tool usage/analysis in training). My manager was a great individual and willing to help out when times were difficult. They made it there business to not only find out about me and what was going on in my life, but ensured that we were mentally and physically healthy as the job is very demanding. Colleagues were amazing, and would be willing to help. They were always a phone call/text message away. Whether job related, or personal issues we were able to discuss anything. We would only see each other, collectively, three times a year. It would be good to have more shadowing opportunities to learn more from each other and keep the account management practice fresh. The most difficult part of the job, in my opinion, can be the customers (tire dealers) that you are serving. Depending on your territory placement, you may have some hardcore businessmen, or blue collar guys needing your help and more down to earth. If the balance is there, I believe the job can be a cinch. It's important to be very organized, as a lot of information comes at you each month. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was correspondence with the men ...more ProsGreat diversity, camaraderie among colleagues, career growth opportunities, health benefits, training and development ConsTerritory placement (less seasoned ASMs in more mature business market can be disastrous), career growth only seems to be focused in sales, better on-boarding in to new territory 2.0 Production | Lexington, SC | Nov 6, 2018 If it looks too good to be true... This place seems to be modeled after government jobs. If you have worked and thrived in government jobs, this is the place for you! They're obsessed with pc culture (going green, bio-metrics testing, hiring to meet quotas rather than hiring based on skill. Under-utilizing skills by placing people in the wrong departments. Advancement is all about who you know and stroking egos. The list goes on and on). They punish competent workers by overloading them. Rather than holding incompetent, lazy workers accountable. They also blame the competent ones for all the existing problems. Lots of people wandering around departments during shifts doing nothing but running their mouths. Very cut-throat and toxic work environment. The company talks a big talk. Their company mission goals sound great on paper. Too bad they don't actually enforce any of it. This place fosters a backstabbing culture. Great for people with no ambition. If you have any ambition, you will get thrown under the bus or sabotaged. Rather than being seen as an asset. Work hours are terrible. Antiquated swing shifts. Still holding onto needless traditions from the early 1900s. They say this is because they want to be \"fair\" to everyone. Give veteran workers the ability to go day shift and have the onboard hires start out on night shift. At least that way employees are working consistent sleep schedules. The only thing these swing shifts do, is mess up employee sleep patterns. Adjusting to constantly changing sh...more 1.0 Builder | Spartanburg, SC | Sep 29, 2018 US3 is a joke Michelin overall would be a great place to work IF after the first year you got raises every year, or they didn't put a cap on the pay your making in certain areas in which you have 50 different jobs to do! Also, dealing with management is nothing short of being back in high school! They gossip, tell everyone's personal business to everyone else, there is favoritism throughout the plant! Spartanburg US3 has a lot of bullying going on also! And ANY accident is YOUR fault, they do not accept anything short of any accident is avoidable, BUT you don't have ANY updated machines that aren't over 40-50 years old! Go figure! And I've learned that this particular plant has it's own set of rules that doesn't exist at the others! You are constantly being pushed for numbers that are not possible without sacrificing quality, or yourself! They don't care about safety until someone gets hurt, then management is running around like chickens with their heads cut off! Maintenance doesn't have a clue, when they leave from a project it's still broke! Many people call the Bee Line because they are scared of losing their jobs if they said something to managent in which in return will turn into retaliation! I've heard good things about Michelin, but working there, or should I say US3 is nothing short of ridiculous! ProsThe benefits ConsThey don't pay enough for the rotations you work, baically taking your life away! And US3 are the ONLY ones with 5 different rotations 3.0 Manufacturing Specialist | Lexington, SC | May 15, 2012 Fast paced production with hard labor and long hours. Everyday I came to work I knew what was expected. We had meetings on morning shifts then I would go to my machine and start producing tires. If it was an off shift, I would fill out the proper paperwork and begin producing tires. I mainly learned to work with different types of people and what it really means to be a part of a team. The management at Michelin was okay. You had your good managers who looked out for people and talked to you as if you mattered. Then you had the type of manager who looked down on people and was only out for themselves. The co-workers there were okay as well. It was a pretty stressful environment at times so not everyday was a good day. But because we worked so many hours together some of us felt as though we were family and bonded well. The hardest part of the job was the labor. After 12 hour shifts sometimes it was hard to stay awake while driving home. Then with the repetitive motion to complete the tasks caused alot of injury to the joints and bones on the body. The most enjoyable part of the job was recieving the excellent benefits such as free tires, free Sam's Club membership and \"Family Day\" when they had rides and food for the employee families. Prosfree tires, excellent benefits, excellent pay Conshard labor that caused of alot injury to the body, long hours, rotating shifts, no real room for advancement. 4.0 Material Handler | Lexington, SC | Feb 22, 2016 Once you are in a team, you learn great patterns, build team confidence After 12 years, always doing what was asked. If you are female I would tread lightly. Working in an mostly male environment with male management they tend to not understand certain issues with female employment. May it be personal home life which sometimes you have no control over or a way out, or a situation that happens in the plant. Unforeseen circumstances!!! If you work with someone in your shop/group/plant that doesn't like you, they will not do anything to protect you as an employee, regardless if its something you did or didn't do, they are in it to cover their own. Don't tell your personal problems or anything you don't want the plant to hear about. Something's you can't talk to management about. 1. Your are too embarrassed about it an 2. They come up with all the reasons to help you or what you need to do but can't. I lost my job due to a situation i could not get away from, was even attacked in the plant. The sheer embarrassment alone should have shown management what I had been going through... Some compassion in areas but some there isn't... ProsSome of the greatest team mates i ever worked with ConsNeed someone on plant site for employees to talk to, to be more open to, then that person can share with appropriate management. 4.0 Order Picker | Louisville, KY | Nov 12, 2014 Very fun and productive job whish i didnt run out. At this job my days consisted of doing pre forklift checks to make sure that my forklift was in good running condition so that my co workers as well as myself were safe. Once I done the pre check inspection I had a mailbox where all my orders to either pick pull or stock were and I could pick and pull at my own speed unless a truck needed to be unloaded due to the way the picking order schedule(we was always pulling a day before to stay ahead) was set. I learned the difference between tires for passenger cars, 18 wheelers, nobbi tires for dirt bikes and how to palletize truck tire as well as how to lift and set the pallets on the cone that the tires sat on. My co workers were cool but we were always busy picking and pulling so we never interacted unless at lunch. The hardest part of this job was rolling 235 pound truck tires up my knee and placing them perfectly on the pallet so other truck tires could fit with mixed orders form companies. The most enjoyable part of this job was I could work at my own speed and learning the difference in the tires. ProsThe ability to work by myself and at my own speed. ConsLearning to properly lift those 235 pound truck tires. 1.0 Tugger | Fort Wayne, IN | Oct 25, 2015 Very unorganized First day on the job and management told me to just have a seat and they would find me a trainer. After 2 hours of sitting another guy ask me what I was doing. I said waiting on a trainer. Well the guy that told me to sit went home. Then the trainer they got me was all mad that he had to train me. The place was so screwed up. We had to Scan material and was trained when the scanners don't work just beat them on the machines until they start working. Had to move material all over the plant to store. No organization for this at all. Areas were poorly marked. Same material in different areas. All most impossible for new people to learn locations. Very disappointed in how this company was ran. First night had a few people tell me the place suck to work at. All had stories on how they have been screwed. The 2 week training before you start on the floor was excellent had a great bunch of guys.Old beat up equipment that keep breaking down. Because I quit I would never get hired back but I wish I could go back and work to organize the storage of the material and setup the locations and label it. Insurance was the best around.
