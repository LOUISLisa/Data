You will be on your feet ALL day. -Heavy workload, but expects no overtime. Sometimes, there is missing food or equipment to get the job done. Can take hours to receive food or equipment. YET still expects one to finish on time. Should be 8 hour shifts, but tends to be 10-13. Even when the kitchen is understaffed, they expect you to leave on time! -Management really does not care. I can't stress it enough that management is awful! Any problems reported to them will result in NOTHING.They put all the pressure on the employees. There could be a million issues happening and they will just go home. -Poor training.They will throw you to the wolves. They don't train you well, but put a lot of pressure on you and expect you to know everything about the job. Also, there needs to be some cross training. If you're the only one that knows the job, they expect you to come in on your days off instead of training others. -At least 75% of the people do not speak English, which could be a good and bad thing. Bad because it may be difficult to communicate with each other. You may have to find someone to translate. Good because you begin to pick up on different languages because you are always exposed to it. -There isn't a whole lot of team work. Everyone's favorite line is, \"that's not my job.\" You can tell that everyone is stressed. It is far from a positive work environment. People are always yelling at each other making others feel uncomforta...more 2.0 expoditor / gate keeper | South San Francisco, CA | Dec 6, 2015 No managment at all i worked for them for 6 months in 2014 i will tell if you are going to work in the south san francisco location you must learn fluent mandarin or cantonese 90% of the people dont speak english i was an expoditor/gate keeper in the final cooler this was the most unorganized place i have ever worked in everybody did what they want the driver and driver helpers will pull flights early with missing items or just leave a whole cart behind and the pantry or galley will get ripped a new one for it the kitchen even if its not thier fault the flight checkers are the punching bags for when things go bad as well and when someone isnt getting yelled you pretty much do what you want rules dont really mean much here the work it self is pretty straight forward and simple an 8 year could do it count it and bag it well if you are a checker its a little more difficult you need to train your self there is no propper training its all guess work you walk in they tell you this person is your trainer and 90% of the time they dont speak english so your on your own and as for cleanliness epic fail never fly united if you do dont eat the food, the food carts and the ovens that the hot food is packed in are never clean they come off one flight and then reload and pushed right back out to the next flight with the burnt crusty stuff no washing need i guess...not even a once over with a clean rag. The best thing about this place was the free ice cream and candy and well i met a few good friends from the 1...more ProsFree Lunch Free candy Consno accountability everyone blames everyone 1.0 Food Preparation Worker | Atlanta, GA | Nov 21, 2017 Horbbile The part I didn't like was the older supervisors treated you like slaves talk about you in front of other people basiclly belittle you but still want you to give them good productivity. The bathrooms are always nasty there are roachs an nates all in the building an in the food. They take your overtime pay so it looks like you only work partime when you work full time an overtime. The payroll person is never in her office when they mess up our pay we suppose to be in a union but they dont even take union dues they say we have a shift differential of 0.05 an they put you regular hours down twice sso they wont have to pay you overtime. The food makes you sick an we might have one meal a day but suppose to be feed 3 times a day yeah right. This place feed people dreams an lies just to get worker but they dont even last a month and they bribe you with if you dont miss a day of work you get 250 dollars the end of your 90 probation I didnt know nothing about this till after my 90 days because when they hire new people they tell them different things. They need to be shut down obviously from the looks of these reviews the whole company need to be shut down because this is the worse place I ever worked. I wont an wouldnt recommend no one to come here an its sad because the work isnt hard its the high above people who are making it bad. ProsWeekly pay ConsEverything else 2.0 Assembler | Los Angeles, CA | May 24, 2013 Needlessly overworked, egregiously underpaid. For me, a typical day at work is about 9-10 hours of making salads & fruit appetizers in a large 40 degree cooler to be consumed by passengers on flights leaving LAX with our contracted clients. Management which communicates poorly with both the workforce & other members of management hinders progress frequently & creates a stream of misinformation on a nearly daily basis. My co-workers are mostly very nice, happy people, but the vast majority of the workforce here is Hispanic & many speak little to no English, making practical communication very difficult at times. I enjoy making the items & learning about the airline food industry, but getting paid barely above minimum wage for long hours of work that is hard on your respiratory system, feet, joints, & back makes it difficult to maintain a positive attitude, especially when management is combative & not supportive. ProsFood is provided for all workers free of charge, Overtime is readily available for those who want it, Workforce is mostly friendly Cons1 year wait to be eligible for most benefits, including paid time off & sick leave, Poor management, Long hours, Constant 40 degree temperature work space, Entire shift done while standing, No headphones or outside food of any kind allowed, Difficult & broken lines of communication 1.0 Packer | Los Angeles, CA | Dec 6, 2018 Sexual harrasment, Incompetent Supervisors, Drinking on the Job High Turnover- Incompetent supervisors, drunk employees, sexual harassment, You will get fired for talking against this behavior. Hispanic people will talk in Spanish and call English speakers derogative names. Mandatory excess hours of overtime because they cannot keep employees. Start work: work non-stop- no one to relieve you during your paid rest break but expected to meet production goals. Work place culture: If you do not comply with the harassment and the workers slow pace, you will be bullied. Communication with supervisors leads nowhere. HR. Slow at taking corrective action. Good: They provide free food for us. The company's concept is great. The management is negatively impacting the climate and cant keep good workers because they do not hold people accountable for harassing behavior. No training they pair you up with workers who are already overworked and underpaid and they are expected to train you. Team meetings are like sermons not motivating or goal oriented. The actual work is easy and it would be a great company if they could keep a decent climate with respect and procedures to help meet the companies goal. They to re train manager/supervisors. ProsFree Cafeteria Food ConsSexual harrasment, Incompetent Supervisors, Drinking Job, high turnover 1.0 inbound international flights | Atlanta, GA | Sep 12, 2016 Horrible Place to Work !!!! I've always prided myself on my ability to stay with a company and grow for years as in 10+. This company I only stayed 2 months. They work you overtime without notice up to 4 hours over. This happened on a regular basis. In two and half months I only went home on time twice. They don't care about their employees. Your expendable. You do get to eat free in the cafeteria as a job perk. What they fail to mention is that its leftovers from what airlines no longer wanted to serve, rarely is there enough to go around, its overcooked and prepared in unsanitary filthy conditions. The bathrooms are worse than any freeway service station restroom I've ever been in. Management talks to their employees like dogs. They will yell, embarrass, and humiliate you in front of co workers. The pay is minimal for the amount of work they want. Its like a dirty sweat shop. If I were you I would never drink from a soda can on a Delta plane ever again. Its just gross what conditions these are kept in and then just rinsed off with just water(sometimes not even clean water) and sent right back out for people to drink on a plane. I would not recommend this job to anyone. I don't mind the work. Its the conditions and the treatment that are intolerable. Prosfree uniforms after 90 days Conseverything 2.0 Warehouse Worker | Far Rockaway, NY | Jun 22, 2017 Giant warehouse with many airline products to be provided, free meals courtesy of the company A typical day at work starts you off with providing food for the people who organize said food before they ship it off to their assigned airlines for passengers. Next, you either organize the cages which hold all the supplies or you roll in more cargo to be used for later. I sharpened my multitasking abilities and received a personal understanding of how to run and work in a warehouse, such as organizing shipments and also quickly taking them in to be locked until further use. The work was fast paced and required you to rush to your next task. Socializing took place mostly during lunch breaks. Every worker was vital to the company so your position was guaranteed. Very little chances of advancement as a warehouse helper. The honest reason for me leaving so soon was the distance I had to travel to reach it. The long hours were also difficult. I enjoyed helping others with their daily requisitions and needs. It always feels nice to help people lessen their workload. ProsFree meals all the time, refillable drinks ConsLong distance to reach, must know a little Spanish in order to work with others 4.0 Human Resources Manager | Chicago, IL | Sep 11, 2013 Opportunity for greatness This was a company that had some issues. The great thing was that they recognized that there were challenges and were open to making the appropriate changes to move forward. For me this meant that there were plenty of opportunities to share my knowledge. It was such a great growth opportunity for me. I was able to lead the charge by revamping the on boarding process, creating a mentor program, and developing training programs for managers to work on issues to help change the culture to one that was more in tune with employee needs. Personally, I loved being able to roll up my sleeves and create programs and solutions to the daily issues that plagued the company and hindered it from reaching it's goals. I learned that trust and respect are key to working to change a culture. It is so important that managers and employees trust that you have their best interest at heart and that you have their back as well. As an HR professional, I think it is so important for managers to know they can come to you for guidance and not feel that they are being judged. ProsFree lunch, dedicated people, senior leaders with vision Conschange is not easy 2.0 Assembler | Los Angeles, CA | Nov 1, 2018 Dont do it Only plus is weekly check & some good employees...all the rest is stress you can be sent to a station & have no plates, food, equipment to work with...if you're missing hot food good luck getting it in a timely manner...production can be increased from doing 1 flight to doing 2/3 & then you get sent some of the slowest employees to \"help\" If you're getting payed about the same rate then you should be expected to work quickly with a purpose but no one gets reprimanded people are putting in OT on tasks that sometimes can be completed in 5 hours or less...alot of food substitutions because they run out/waste...very surprising they still hold on to the accounts they have, they're constantly implementing sanitation methods which aren't working since bacteria is still in their sewer pipes but they try to blame the workers for all their problems & worse if you say you worked at Gate Gourmet some other caterers WON'T hire you...as in culture things seem ok but it only takes something small for tensions along racial lines to come up ProsWeekly check ConsManagers try to work you harder if you have seniority, cant take breaks because you wanna get the heck outta there 1.0 Dishwasher | New Jersey | Mar 15, 2013 Gate Gourmet (worse job ever) I'm currently working for this company, I chosen this job because ,as we all know its hard to find one. Im grateful i have this job but, this company really blows. The people there barely speak any english, most of them are foreigners. The management is very sloppy, plus this job under pays people. Your job can be dishwasher but have you doing porter work (janitor). My problem is pay rate and schedule assigning. The only time I enjoy my job is Monday and Tuesday when the manager is not there, things get done alot faster. They've fired one guy because he took two days off for the weekend, which he has a reason too, they worked him 3 weeks with no days off and fired him for calling out. So this company will work you to death, nobody barely speaks english and basically getting rid of every black, white, Asian American person there is so they can hire their own people to work and slave them for minimum wage. This company stay away from it. I regret working here!!!! Pros1 break for 30 min and lunch break for 30 min and free food Consbelow pay rate, no advancements, too many overtimes, no set schedules Questions And Answers about GateGourmet What questions did they ask during your interview at GateGourmet?

But so far I love my job and the employees are are easy to get along with. Yes it\u2019s union based but when you have great people skills working with unionized employees isn\u2019t so bad.
