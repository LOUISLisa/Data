ProsGreat first job in IT ConsLimited Career Growth 3.0 IT Consultant/Contractor | Delaware | Sep 2, 2019 Es una empresa normal no apoeta mucho a sus consultores pero si tiene buenos projectos y buenos clientes Buen ambiente y excelente produccion, Es una empresa normal no apoeta mucho a sus consultores pero si tiene buenos projectos y buenos clientes 4.0 Software Engineer Intern | Birmingham, AL | Aug 5, 2019 Good atmosphere, with nice amenities. Good coworkers make it better. It was a nice place to work in my short time there. I was placed on a team doing something I had never done before. They made sure to encourage me and push me no matter what happened. I do wish that management had communicated more with us, but it was still a great experience. 3.0 Technology Consultant | Madrid, IA | Apr 6, 2013 Challenging and productive workplace IÂ´ve learned a lot in this company and gained experience in a challenging environment. 5.0 Systems Analyst | Arlington, VA | Jul 17, 2016 Great I had a wonderful time working there, even though most of my job was not in the building. Great job Great folks 5.0 Technical Associate | Arlington, VA | Oct 11, 2016 Free Health Insurance (You & Your Family) I have been working at EVERIS USA full-time (More than 2 years). Great company with a lot potential to grow. I experienced positive interaction with upper management from the very beginning, which had continued throughout my employment. ProsI have been with EVERIS USA for almost 2 years. Great benefits and few yearly events are standard. ConsNone so far. Would like to get more salary but that's what everyone wants :-) 2.0 Senior Associate | Boston, MA | Nov 15, 2012 Would advise to take a job at a consulting firm with more direction Long hours, decent pay, bad management, bad work life balance 5.0 Software Engineer | Birmingham, AL | Oct 21, 2019 The best place to begin your software developer career. I was hired right out of coding bootcamp. They really took time to let me get familiar with their tech stack and helped me walk into the shallow end when they felt I was ready. If I ever had a question, I was surrounded by senior developers who would not hesitate to help me figure out what was going on. The work place was very relaxed, the hours were casual, and our team leads were outstanding being both knowledgeable and approachable. ProsGreat place to start, treated people like grown ups. ConsSometimes I would get in trouble for not doing things that no one ever told me to do. Paperwork wise, not development.
