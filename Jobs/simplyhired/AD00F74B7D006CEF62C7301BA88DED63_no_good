For going to the bathroom and going to the break room when it was not your break time you're in a point system and in the end I was one of the last two people out of my training class out of about 25 when it it only been 2 months the whole class was just about fi...more ProsRelaxed ConsVery strict rules for such a minimum based pay company 1.0 Help Desk Analyst | Auburn Hills, MI | Dec 28, 2018 This company should be ASHAMED A typical day at Mphasis consist of answering phones, being extremely detailed on all calls in description box, taking abuse from the rude clients we often get, micromanaged by leadership. I learned how to have more patience that I didn't have before I worked here. Working with these clients its safe to say you may need a shot when you get off or before entering work. The people that call are sometimes rude and very incompetent but there are some nice people that call time to time. Management is horrible, they have poor communication and treat us like we are beneath them. Lets not mention people that are not in these managerial roles that think they are and try to dictate orders because they are friends with management. The Lilly Desk is the worst desk to be employed for being that our leaders do not have our back and lack backbone to stand up to their bosses to let them know how badly we are treated. The hardest part of this job is dealing with the phony managers that walk around here and you hear them talking about other ;people that they smile in front of. They need to do an evaluation of our leaders because apparently if you are not friends with them you will not be recognized to be someone of leadership. They do not give raises at this company at least not at the Help Desk even the RDM team says that haven't received raises either. Making $13.25 an hour with all the brain power we exhibit here is insulting. This job should start at $17 at least an hour. Too much is deman...more Prosits a little job Conspoor pay, poor management 1.0 Help Desk Analyst | Auburn Hills, MI | Dec 28, 2018 Management boo!-coworkers yay! I've known people that have worked here for years and haven't seen more than an intro wage. They heads talk about giving a raise but no action has ever been taken. Most of the people that leave here do so because of the wages. The wages are ok if you do not have any kids or student loans, but most people that have a job here have one or the other if not both. The heads of house are impulsive in their decisions, poor decisions at that. They make the decision, go with it- don't do anything to support the decision until it is already in place and will not tell you about it until the night before they do it, at the soonest. Management tends to stick to themselves, never talking to their employees, and seem willing to throw them under the bus. the over-strict policies hold almost no accommodation for slow days. Better hope you are busy or you will be very bored. Almost no reward for doing well, you either meet the company's strict standards for your desk, or you don't. If you don't you are in trouble, if you do you are probably cheating and will get in trouble anyway. All the major issues with the company come from up the chain Anyone from any team is friendly and everyone is willing to help everyone. I can talk to my Supervisor or Team Lead and they will help me out, and your coworkers will be more than willing to help and laugh with you. Even with the strict policies- they will keep you entertained. This is a very friendly work environment and very accom...more ProsFriendly, Flexible ConsLow pay, poor management, over-strict policy 2.0 Software Engineer | Maitland, FL | Feb 19, 2020 Waste of time I entered the software development US campus program at Mphasis along with approximately 20 other individuals. Most, if not all of us were fresh out of college or had little to no software development work experience. We were provided with technical training for about 2-3 months. This training was a mess to say the least. We were told at the beginning our trainer would be there on the first day, but after 2 weeks he still wasn't there. For the first 3 weeks we were going through online videos for our training (which were extremely terrible). Once the trainer got there, it wasn't so bad as he was extremely knowledgeable. We were told at the beginning of the program that halfway through, we'd be able to give preferences as to locations we wanted to be assigned to, and also that we would at max have to wait a month before being assigned. What actually happened was we had no say in where we wanted to go (meaning they lied to us) and personally I had to wait 5 months after the training ended to actually get assigned to a location. The first person to go to a client location only took a couple weeks but for the majority of us we had to wait several months. Client locations would contact us and say they want us to start on XX date, then completely ghost you 3 days before you were supposed to start. Overall, everything we were told during training ended up being a lie and I feel like I wasted a year of my life when I could have been getting experience elsewhere.

A typical day consisted of answering email and phone queries, helping customers with presales and technical issues. I often guided our customers through the process - explaining in detail and answering questions. I also maintained the SCC lab environment, performed testing and R&D on the supported software and hardware. I learned a great deal about current software platforms, improved my troubleshooting skills and gained insight into large corporate B2B relations. I really enjoyed talking to people and solving problems. I also like learning new things and developing improvements to processes. The hardest part was dealing with novice customers who thought they knew everything and refused to conform to our proven established procedures for our team's engagement, which often led to failed opportunities. My immediate manager was very nurturing and a champion for my advancement and development. However the upper corporate structure was lacking in communication and execution, which led to the project's client to cancel the contract. ProsNo 2 days were the same ConsPoor corporate management, lack of proper funding for needed resources. 1.0 Technical Support Specialist | Tulsa, OK | Feb 7, 2019 Ruined our Account I was an employee with HPE/DXC before Mphasis bought the contract from Modis. Mphasis is based out of India and offshores in the United States. As soon as Mphasis took over our account they cut our staffs pay tremendously and fired many higher ups or demoted them down to level one agents making entry level wages (these were employees who had been there for YEARS knocked down to 12.59$/hr.) Those who weren\u2019t fired and chose to stay reaped the consequences of Mphasis taking over which included lack of adequate training, staffing, living wages, tools, proper accesses, job security, SLAs not being met, accounts pulling out, sites closing, and much more. There are no raises, despite the promises of a merit based system. There are constant BED BUGS. Accounts keep shutting down and clients are losts due to the unorganization. We are losing the Auburn Hills site in Michigan and Mphasis still thinks they\u2019re doing a great job here. It\u2019s clear, that they\u2019re not.... I would highly recommend looking for a job elsewhere. The company is not honest, is very impulsive, and untrustworthy. Good luck. ConsMphasis 5.0 Technical Support Specialist | Tulsa, OK | Dec 4, 2019 relaxed environment I have felt included since my first day working here, even with a disability. They had my accomodating software installed from my first day on the job. hen I encounter issues with software accessibility, they are open to do anything I need to continue doing my job. I always feel welcome and never like a burden. e sometimes have sponsored lunches and celebrations. We are generallly given flexiility with out schedule based on attendance, which feels good to me because I have a sense of control, as this is a factor I can directly control. So if you have best attendance, you can choose your shift within reason. The staff helps us to setup all our tools in a classroom environment and one-onone if needed. The only thing I struggled with was short, half-hour lunch time if working 8 hour shifts, but now I work 10 hour shift and have 3 days off each week. We have set schedules once we are given our shifts, and so their are no surprises. Also, sometimes there is overtime available. We have QA evals frequently, but I don't feel micromanaged at all. 2.0 Program Manager | Jersey City, NJ | Sep 20, 2012 Program Manager - Application Architecture During the tenure with Mphasis, an HP company, started off with a role Web Developer and worked up the ladder to a Senior Project Manager with expertise in managing multiple projects through all the phases of the project\u2013 Initiation, Planning, Execution, Control and Closure following a global delivery model wither extensive experience in onsite-offshore development.
