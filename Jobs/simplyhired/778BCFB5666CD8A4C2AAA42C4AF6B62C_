It's a real estate company trying to be a tech company but they have not figured out where they fit in the industry or how to get there. They change directions very often and it's hard to understand what or who drives the change. Because they think they are a tech company the people as in Real Estate clients and many of their agents are trampled or missed or left behine. 4.0 Transaction Coordinator | Charlestown, MA | Jan 14, 2019 Great company to work for Redfin is a great company to work for and offer incredible benefits, The people who work for Redfin are all really nice and an enjoyable place to work. 4.0 Licensed Realtor | Austin, TX | Oct 28, 2017 Innovative Real Estate Company Redfin is a technology based real estate company that focuses on customer satisfaction. No two days are the same, and we have the opportunity each day to help people find their dream home, or sell their current home. ProsFlexible ConsHours are not guaranteed. 3.0 Realtor | Maryland | Nov 29, 2017 Good Place to Learn Good place to learn Real Estate in a fast paced environment. Training is very good and some Sr Agents are very helpful. You can set your own schedule, but most work is weekends and evenings when real estate buyers are searching. ProsPeople, Lunches, Training, Software Conslong hours followed by slow days. inconsistent workload 5.0 Market Manager | Federal Way, WA | Jun 28, 2019 Fun workplace and very happy environment This is an excellent company with many different jobs available to move around if desired. Managers are amazing and CEO is always communicating. This is a great company if you want to learn and grow. ProsFood and Benefits ConsNone 4.0 Support Manager | United States | May 11, 2019 Growing Pains The company is transitioning from a quirky start up to the pressures and demands of a publicly traded company. The feel is a bit more corporate and your experience can largely be determined by what management chain you belong to. Some upper managers are still on point. While others no longer \u201cmanage to the corporate mission\u201d. The highest level operations management team used to be unified and had a pulse on what was happening in the field. With growth and reorganization the incredibly gifted executive team is unaware of the impact of many decisions made at the management level below them. I hope to be here a long time. But I\u2019ve seen too many good people around me get let go and everyone that knows them scratches their head on why that decision was made. The questions go unanswered or the answer is lame. I love what I do and I believe in the mission. But I no longer apply for positions above me because it seems the higher you go the more likely you will get lopped even if you are doing well. ProsCompensation, Work Environment, Stellar Benefits ConsLack of job security in management, capricious decision making that impacts many 5.0 Realtor | Long Beach, CA | Mar 30, 2020 Best Company on the PLANET I absolutely LOVE the culture at redfin. It is a huge family, and I feel so supported. There is a lot of opportunity to grow and succeed. I have brought 2 of my past coworkers to work here and recommend the job to anyone and everyone! 4.0 Broker | Washington, DC | Mar 4, 2019 Good place to work! Work/life balance can be hard in any Real Estate job. Redfin tries to create a fun and challenging atmosphere. The upper management has made errors in staffing, but learns and corrects mistakes quickly. ProsBenefit and Team are Incredible ConsBonuses are based on a vague Customer Service Survey 4.0 Transaction Coordinator | Portland, OR | Apr 2, 2019 Redfin Culture is good depending on what location you work at. Where Redfin lacks is the lack of career advancement. Management can also be really good in some locations and really poor in others. The pay structure has changed three times in four years, so prepare for that if you choose to work there. Questions And Answers about Redfin How did you get your first interview at Redfin? Asked Jun 28, 2016 Reply fast to the job post and write a brief cover letter of why you want to work for Redfin. They love people who are willing to compromise pay in order to change the real estate industry. \u201cRedefine Real Estate\u201d is their motto Answered Mar 26, 2019 Red fin real estate Answered Dec 26, 2018 Is there kind of training provided to prepare new Associate Agents for their positions, i.e. showing home giving tours and communicating with potential clients? Asked Mar 1, 2017 Yes but it's all video training. It takes a few weeks to fall into your own groove. Be humble, don't overstep and you'll be fine. Answered Apr 5, 2019 Yes. You will shadow lead agents or other experienced AA\u2019s. Answered Mar 26, 2019 Do you offer part time or full time work only? What is the pay structure for part timers vs Full timers? Asked Aug 30, 2016 Full time only unless specified in the job posting Answered Mar 26, 2019 Full time only. Answered May 25, 2017 What benefits does Redfin offer? Asked Jun 28, 2016 Great benefits. Medical, Dental, Vision - fulltimers accrue vacation and sick pay. Answered Mar 26, 2019 For salaried/ on-staff (not contractor/ not AA) positions the benefits are pretty good actually. Healthcare is the highlight - a very good plan (multiple levels) with affordable premiums, even for the premium PPO plan. Dental coverage is a widely accepted Delta Dental plan. Vision coverage is offered. Life and disability insurance is standard. There are discounts you can get as a Redfin employee. Office staff are also reimbursed for a wide variety of expenses. The big drawback is the lack of 401k match but overall the benefits are good, probably one of the best things about working at Redfin. For office staff, other benefits (like free lunch) are more dependent on the office you are in. Most corporate offices have kitchens that are supplied with coffee, soda, snacks,etc. Answered Sep 15, 2018 Can redfin agents also work at another firm? Asked Jul 16, 2017 No. Real Estate license laws are the same. Answered Mar 26, 2019 No they cannot. Answered Sep 4, 2018"
