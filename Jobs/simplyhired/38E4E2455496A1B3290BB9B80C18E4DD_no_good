The work as a customer service representative is standard for any customer service call center. The 3rd party status of the company results in it being worse than other call centers in regards to the way representatives are treated by customers. This is largely caused by the hotel industry which not only allows unethical practices, such as purposely overbooking and cancelling long held reservations to create opportunities for booking the Anne rooms at higher rates, but seems to embrace them at times. Since their biggest customers, large chain hotels, work with such firm practices, many hotel staff are unaware of how 3rd party companies work and often pass these complications and misconceptions onto the guests who then contact Booking.com for assistance from an often uncaring hotel. This results in many guests that are upset with both companies as Booking.com has to rely on the original offender our other hotels who usually have a similar business model to the original property. That being said, very few call centers pay well enough to make up for the stress that is common in the industry and Booking.com is not one of them. Even then, they offer a higher than average amount of paid time off which also functions as paid sick days should they be needed. They also provide paid holidays, should you not be required of volunteer to work them, with an option to gain an additional day of paid time off should you work the holiday and choose to give up the standard holiday pay increa...more ProsThey treat their employees better than most companies do. ConsIt's still a call center, Hotel customers increase the difficulties with the customer service industry. 2.0 Editor | New York, NY | Nov 21, 2013 If you really, really need the work Pros \u2013 You don't need much knowledge or experience to step into most roles at the company in order to succeed. They provide plenty of training and overview (considered by some to be overkill) before you even lift a finger in whatever role you'll fill. The jobs themselves are easy and the tools provided basically hand-feed you all the relevant information. The benefits package is decent, there are company-sponsored happy hours generally once per month and a company holiday party held in Amsterdam each winter. Also, this is the epitome of a 9-5 job, where there is rarely anything so important that it can't wait until your next workday. Cons \u2013 While easy, the work load in the last year for most roles at the company has grown so exponentially that it has become bitterly overwhelming. The constant merging and purging that that company has done has left the remaining employees accumulating new responsibilities with no additional compensation and with low morale (fearing future secret decisions will lead to further mass displacement or firings). Speaking of which, pay is beyond low. The company pays well below the average compared to other top competitors within a similar industry and the standards for earning the quarterly bonuses keep changing. Many employees have even half-jokingly accused the company of \"testing\" for ways to make it impossible to earn. Most managers lack knowledge, leadership skills or both. Opportunities are extremely rare at this point within any of the est...more ProsChristmas party in Amersterdam, a free lunch once per month, occasional free happy hour Conspoor management, high turnover rate, low pay, low growth potential 5.0 Customer Service Representative | Grand Rapids, MI | Feb 21, 2020 A job that keeps you on your toes Booking.com is a great company to work with, in my opinion. There is a lot of information thrown at you during training, however, it is broken up into two parts so you'll get to apply the knowledge you learned. This job makes me think and use problem solving skills which I truly enjoy. Every case is unique and keeps you on your toes. I will not say it is the easiest job in the world. Customer service jobs are tough. You will have times where it gets extremely frustrating because customers are upset with you and can't get their way. As far as management/other employees - everyone has been so nice, supportive and helpful. Although everyone is on different teams, it feels like we're one big team because everyone is so willing and ready to help with any questions. I've never felt unwelcome. You will be checked on often to help you develop and improve in your role. I've already brought up advancing in job and my manager was 100% on board with wanting to help me grow. Shifts go 8 &10 hours. From what I've seen, everyone works weekends. They do have different shift options, but weekends seem like a must. There is a premium for working on the weekends though! Booking.com as a whole is always listening for feedback and constantly changing to be a better company for it's customers and employees. I love the benefits - health, dental and vision. Gym on site, massage chairs, fitness reimbursements, Free fruits, coffee/tea/hot chocolate. They have a mini store to buy disc...more 1.0 Event Planner | New York, NY | Sep 21, 2015 Terrible! While the culture may be fun, that only lasts for about a week when you realize people who are managers haven't graduated from diapers to potty on their own. Sale people are subjected to their phone, half hour for lunch, if you're one minute late, you get points against you. As for the admin side, while they don't do that (well last I was there), the Office Manager has serious issues of her own. The level of disrespect is an atrocity. The admin calls are a waste of time. All voices chiming in on how a job could be done better instead of taking those two hours and doing the job. They expect you to life heavy boxes and the sales team can't help you if you ask for help, you get in trouble. ???? This coming from twenty something year old manager who does nothing but writing poetry all day on how much he loves the company and reads them during the Monday morning meetings (issues much?) Then they're not sure who you're reporting to...are you reporting to the office manager or the manager on site who has secret conversations with the office manager and then come back and invent stories about you three months later. The employees there have a lot of grown up to. Since my departure, they haven't found a suitable admin and agencies in New York refuse to work with them because they don't know what they are looking for. If you're an admin, spare yourself from this circus. Trust me the Ringling Brother's treat their elephants better than you would be treated at this pl...more ProsNone ConsEverything a company shouldn't be! 2.0 CSE | Berlin, NH | Jun 1, 2017 Low Pay and Zero Job Security Salary much lower than the average for this type of work and somewhere near the salary that a professional cleaner or anyone without any qualification would be making (without any exposure to the stresses of this particular type of job). You are supposed to leave your desk exactly at 5:30 if your shift ends there, you are not supposed to do more than what your job specification entails. Reporting \"unethical behavior\" is encouraged within the company and employees are invited to \"give feedback\" on the performance and commitment of other employees which makes for the unpleasant feeling of being constantly under scrutiny (and this is quite separate from your metrics, that also come on top of all that measuring). An awkward silence comes if you say anything slightly critical (even if it is a joke) about the company. The greatest drawback of working for this company has been the zero job security. You start with a one-year contract and the probation period is 6 months. Then there is a possibility for contract renewal but this is only for another six months or for another year. So you are constantly stressed if you will get extended, your life is secure for only another 6 months or for another year. If you want to apply for a loan or for a nicer apartment, if you have a family or dependents to provide for, or if you have to convince the immigration authorities, this contract is not going to get you anywhere. If I were to be entirely fair, i think i should rate i...more Prosinternational teams, interesting colleagues, competent and helpful management Consno job security, poverty wages, tactics to keep people docile, stressful interactions with customers or partners, you have to speak all day 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Grand Rapids, MI | Oct 14, 2013 Four years of my life wasted I spent two years there and quit having failed three times to get the promotion my work and knowledge had earnt... I gave full notice and was told I would be welcomed back. I returned a year later once family situations had changed and after working my way back in for almost a year I applied for one of THIRTY of my old position again. Denied. Pay is around $12/hour but ridiculously low funded health care took $2.50/hr of that from me for my family of 3. Was left without enough money to live on. What in 2008 was a great place to work has slowly morphed over 5 years to be your average call centre environment with a load of corporate rules due to their rather low hiring standards. I was eventually fired for posting this on Facebook after a call with a guest: \"Yes, caller, you do have to restart your computer if your browser has locked up. No, you don't have to restart the computer in your car as that doesn't handle anywhere near the kind of data a browser does. And hanging up on me doesn't help either.\" My account is private. The post (and a follow-up post telling people why I got fired) were both removed by Facebook without informing me. My wife is now in withdrawal from prescription pain meds as she has a chronic arthritic condition and now has no health care. We are 10-14 days late paying our rent and facing eviction. Social media policy? Just an excuse to take care of the squeaky wheel in the office. ProsInternational contact, multiple languages ConsAwful corporate style cube farm environment, no recognition of actual skills and experience in promotion process 2.0 Customer Service Representative | Grand Rapids, MI | Jan 7, 2019 Management sucks and sometimes money isn\u2019t worth your mental state. Management breaks or makes the job and recently management has caused so many people to quit or find other opportunities. I worked there 3 years and had to leave because they hardly offered new shifts. When they did, it always seemed people that sucked up to team leads and management would get morning shifts. Everything changed! When I started it wasn\u2019t stressful and our main goal was to provide great customer service to our guests. Now they are numbers based when this job doesn\u2019t require any sales or retention of guests. They make you worry about your talk time, customer satisfaction, your adherence, hold time, your contacts per hour on phones and email, finalize and then make you track every reservation you worked on. Basically the job is being micro managed and are just money hungry. Booking offered a trip to Amsterdam for conferences but that was cancelled. They are open 365 days, they do not close for any holiday. So chances of you working important holidays are high. I spend my New Years at work when the clock hit 12:00 am, January 1st. Management will stab you in the back especially if they do not like you. I\u2019ve seen it happen to a lot of people. ProsSometimes they offer free lunches, PTO is decent. Overtime ConsManagement is bad, favoritism, stressful, dispensable, they don\u2019t care about you. 3.0 Customer Service Representative | Orlando, FL | Sep 5, 2018 Started Fantastic, but Has Declined in Quality Significantly Company began attracting applicants with $1200 referral bonus, trip to Amsterdam for annual conference, both of those things no longer exist. Before, performance criteria based primarily on the quality of the work over the quantity. Now, very ambiguous and constantly changing key performance indicators (KPI) for employees. Company is falling behind in the market due to poor corporate direction focused on quantity of properties opened instead of quality relationship with existing properties and properties retained and it certainly shows in the relationship with partners and obvious cutbacks. Over the last year the company has gone from an amazing company and environment to a standard or even substandard corporate environment. That being said, paid-time off, wage, and benefits are great, work environment is probably still better than the typical American corporate structure -- especially for a call center -- but there is absolutely no room for growth without relocating. This is definitely a temporary, stepping stone company to provide you with a stable place to transition into your next opportunity. ProsLots of free food, paid time-off, benefits, and wage for the work that you do ConsOn the decline, no room for growth 1.0 Partner | Bellevue, WA | Mar 13, 2020 Nepotism Runs Rampant Working at Booking.com might seem good at first, you receive a month of training through their learning and development department. The trainers seemed nice and knowledgeable and spoke good of the company and tried their best to over inflate the company as the best place to work. However, you will see that this is all a facade they put on to keep you around. Once you begin the work a typical day consists of answering calls or emails from partners or guests. You are to follow the schedule to the T which would constantly change throughout the day with very little notice. Then you will realize that colleagues who are in relationships with the quality advisers or team leaders receive preferential treatment and promotions. Their office could use better ventilation as they don't care if fragrances worn by supervisors bother their employees, thus negatively impacting their ability to work with customers/vendors over the phone due to the allergic reactions. Lastly, their office had a bed bug infestation and the leaders did their best to \"hush hush\" the situation, potentially leading to employees bringing the infestation to their place of residence. Due to this I feel that Booking.com seems to have little regard for their employees well-being or property. 2.0 Customer Service Supervisor | Grand Rapids, MI | Jul 31, 2019 notice that the good reviews are very recently posted. The beginning is generally good, the company tries very hard to have a very good culture, everybody is nice, and inclusive, they do not tolerate behavior that goes against those goals, which is good. What they don't tell you is that the pressure increases by the week, and you are subjected to horrible scrutiny of your calls, and how you did not sound empathetic, or if you missed any point of the script, which is hard to do with irate customers that often are calling because they have lost they money, because the hotels rather sell to walk ins paying full rates, or because the reservations they made can not be cancelled in most cases. The pressure is very hight to meet the impossible goals, which most of the time is out of your control due to the nature of the call, and the time it takes to solve the problem. At this point is evident that the benefits and the free coffee and fruit are an effort to appease workers, so they don't leave. The attrition rate is extremely high .Out of a class of about 40, there were about 5 of those people left at the end of the year. ProsBirthday celebrations. free coffee and fruit. Consshort breaks, people without any training or education beyond high school is promoted to supervisory roles, with bad results.
