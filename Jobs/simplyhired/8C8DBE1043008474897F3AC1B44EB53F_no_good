Please take the time to read what I have to say below. I want to start by saying that I initially felt great about working for the company. They said they were the best place to grow and work your way up the ladder etc. You would get bonuses every month for showing up on time and you get to work from the comfort of your own home no silly office politics, all sweet right? Well what I experienced was the complete opposite of sweet. Training was 5 weeks long. During which we went through a bunch of articles and power points. There was so much information and code numbers thrown at you it would make your head turn. Thankfully you are told you don't have to memorize everything. After only the first week of training we are told we would have to take real live phone calls and help customers. This was surprising because we barely knew what we were doing at that point but we were expected to fumble our way through call with a customer which is completely unfair to them that we get to waste their time. The whole training experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I was already feeling unsure about everything at that point. By the time the 5 weeks are up and it is time to hit the floor you are placed on a team with a Team Lead who is pretty much your manager. Now here is where Transcom starts to become the stressful job I was talking about. Your Team Lead may not be available all the time. Even though it was me and my trainees first week on the job we often found ourselves left completely alone for days with no manager to talk to....more ProsForced overtime if you are in it only for the money ConsMetrics, lack of support, low pay, low vacation, you can never call out sick or risk dicipline, no job security 4.0 Technical Support Advisor | Remote | Nov 28, 2018 The Good and The Bad of Working For Transcom This review will be a lengthy one . So if you want all honesty and no bull then please read further . So I am currently a T1iOS , MAC+ Advisor and a Mentor , my job duties include assisting customers with technical and non technical issues . So let\u2019s discuss training if you are interested in this job apply and get hired you will be trained in a room called Blackboard, during this time of training your trainer may or may not be on camera, the training does consists of many slides and a lot of searching for articles in order to properly prepare you to look for information while on a call to assist your customers , during the first or second week you do take phone calls in order to prepare you for when you get on the production floor , but just like any job when you try something for the first time you are very nervous about it and then with practice you become more confident , before you can even make it to the production floor you have to pass your final exam , I have seen people in my training class go all the way through training and don\u2019t make it to the floor because they fail the exam (which if you fail the first time you can take it again) . So once you pass the final exam you then make it to the production floor ,you have about 15 other coworkers and you communicate with your manager via a chat room , a lot of the times the TL\u2019s are busy because they have meetings and sometimes they have to assist coworkers in another BB when they are having tech issues with there system...more ProsWorking from home, job advancement, management ConsPay, the way CSATS are recorded, strict attendance policy 1.0 Technical Support | Fort Worth, TX | Feb 28, 2019 It would be a good job, if there weren't a bunch of unrealistic & suspicious individuals running the show. Before I go into this, let me give some backstory: I've worked for more than a few call centers handling very sensitive customer information, retail stores, and other jobs around my area. If I EVER had to miss a day, I'd always give ample prior notice, unless it was something that happened just out of the blue and needed immediate attention. And even then, I'd still let my managers know what the situation was before my shift started. My Transcom story is fairly short, but worth a read. After accepting the position they offered me, they gave me 24 hours to complete some paperwork. Not a problem, usually, BUT, they sent the wrong versions of the documents. This happened 3 times, before I finally got the correct papers to sign off on. I was barely able to get the documents sent in within the timeframe due to their ignorance and slow response times, but whatever. I finally get the machine they sent out. I go through orientation, which was just everyone getting to know each other more or less. Day one of training was... dull. We didn't really do much but go over basic policies, and a lot of documents that covered the rear of the company I was gonna be working for, and most of it was stuff that everyone knew, minus one or two curveballs. Also, not to mention that they were for all intensive purposes telling us to be shady about things that really needed to be known to our customers. Day two of training is where things started to hit the fan. Where I live, we've been getting a MASSI...more ProsNone. waste of time and effort.

Customers were calling in for a full range of issues dealing with their internet service. Technical, Billing, Issues and New Customers. They take the scripted route and demand that the scripts be read VERBATIM, everytime for every customer, every work perfect. I was actually told by my manager to IGNORE THE CUSTOMER so that they could record me reading the script word for word. The customer could say, \"please shut up\" and I would have to keep on reading. I never did understand where exactly this absurd, militaristic procedure for handling customesr was coming from. I tried talking professionally to my manager and the guy above him explaining that, hey this isn't working. It creates a stressful, negative scenario for everyone invovled, especially the customer, but I was totally brushed off and eventually fired because i was so frustrated. Transcom (a BPO) claimed it was the client (the internet provider) but upon researching the client and posing as a customer myself while talking to the actual client's customer service agent, that was not how I was treated at all. . I was not read scripts and I was helped by a professional, well spoken individulal. Yet the way we were forced to interact with customers was a total departure from any of the well known industry-standard protocals.

I my self had a problem with payroll and they keep messing stuff up , but other than that I like it. it can be stressfull because the company keeps changing the process or policies, and u have to do so much on a call it drives me crazy, even if u would like to have a short call u have to ask them so many things and pitch stuff it's annoying for the customers and for me, but that it's what the company wants for their clients. in terms of the schedulle , they will let u choose what schedule u would like and what days off, witch it was great, I started a second jobe and they change my schedule to a later one without a complain or a will see, they can set dates off for appointments and stuff witch i...more Prosgood pay, you choose your hours, work from home Consnot that many options for health care 2.0 Customer Service Representative | Florida | Nov 28, 2018 Not a good place to work The basic people are great to work with. Training is just a bunch of powerpoints and slides. They expect you to know all about the KB\u2019s and have to pull so many on every single call. You go through 3 weeks of class training and then 2 weeks of nesting. There are no raises no vacation and no sick days. So what you start out at is what you will make. And if you are very lucky you may get a bonus each month with perfect metrics. The insurance offered is so expensive that you will be working for less then federal minimum wage. And if you are sick and in the hospital like me forget it, you get written up and threatened with your job. They play favorites and there are so many people missing five six days and they still have a job. I am still there but actively seeking a new job. QA\u2019s are a nightmare for you never know what KB\u2019s to use on each call and if you use the wrong one you fail your QA, if you don\u2019t continue to say the customers name throughout the call you loose points, it is a never ending cycle of you did this wrong. When all they really need to do is take the time to train you instead of making you read thousands of KB\u2019s to service a call. You don\u2019t get to choose a schedule they choose it for you, and you are locked into that schedule for the time you are with them. I started my class with 25 people and they dropped like flies until there were ten of us left, so I was moved to another class that started with 21 and they dropped like flies as well, we are now at 12.

Too many issues that makes me believe there is something suspicious about the company. 1. This is a company I know that will never verify you verbally they tell whoever wants to verify you to send a fax, please who does that, only Transcom. Seems the headquarters is not in USA is the problem I do not know. I needed someone to verify me the same day, I sent several emails for this purpose, they responded saying they cannot speak to anyone. I called no one would pick up. 2. If you work as a technical support you are on your own. First of all there is nothing techie about the job but more or less of telling lies to the customer about the data package they have for their internet and the customer yells back at you or curses you out. When you try to tell the next level of manager to handle the call they avoid doing so telling you there is no overall manager to speak with. I had an incidence that my team lead said I should ask again that there was a manager available that is just an example of out of many incidences. 3. If you are lucky, i do not want to say unlucky but if you fall under a micro manager forget it you will be stressful. I was a victim. On day he did one on one this so called micro manager was yelling and talking over me and would not allow me to speak and alas ask me what happened after and the so called HR and everyone believed ...more ProsNONE ConsCannot speak with HR, micro management 1.0 Technical Support Specialist | Remote | Oct 19, 2018 The most unprofessional company I've ever seen! I really don't know where to start with this review because I have so much to say... I worked for Transcom for a few months. I was a Technical support advisor. In training, I was told about all of the amazing benefits and support the company had to offer. Well it didn't live up to it's expectations once training was over and I hit production.. I had perfect CSAT surveys for supporting the customers, which is great because that's what helps you get more of a bonus on your paycheck. But my last month with the company that changed, only because customer's would leave reviews, happy with the support I provided but not happy with their product in general. So if you get a bad CSAT survey and it's nothing you did wrong but the product itself, it STILL counts against you and your bonus! This is not right and Transcom needs to make changes to such a unorganized and unprofessional system! There is a disconnect between the training that the company offers you and the way your team lead will tell you to do certain things and how to handle certain situations. I was threatened multiple times to be but on a final warning for not doing things I was never taught to do or even told to do! How am I suppose to do something I was never even informed about? I would constantly be reminded all day long to sign up for overtime which did no good because I would then have to miss other days due to technical issues and be sent home and wait for the problem to be fixed which knocked me out of my overtim...more ProsThe customers ConsUnprofessionalism and lack of support from Management, the CSAT survey system, tech issues with equipment different programs! 1.0 Technical Support Specialist | New Bern, NC | May 1, 2019 Run away!!! I worked here for a few months. I can\u2019t disclose who the client is but whoever you\u2019re thinking you\u2019re more than likely right! My experience was horrible. I had 3 different supervisors in a course of 3 months. The biggest issue was that I was fired on my day off. You are required to provide internet (if working from home). My internet service provider was Spectrum. At the time I had 5 devices using my internet daily, my personal iMac, my cell phone, my husband cell phone, and my work iMac. One day after being on MLOA for surgery, I began my shift as usual. I took one call and after that my cpu stop connecting to the internet. I did the proper procedure and contacted my shift lead, and IT. After days of troubleshooting n sending my cpu in, I was told it was nothing wrong with the cpu. However, all of my remaining devices connected perfectly to the internet. I went through my ISP and had them troubleshoot and even switch my equipment. The cpu still wouldn\u2019t connect via WiFi or Ethernet. I was on the last day of troubleshooting which is the same day for my 2nd part of my surgery. My cell phone broke, and my shift lead was calling me to discuss other options. She couldn\u2019t get through the next day BECAUSE MY PHONE WAS BROKE, and I got an email ending my employment. I was LIVID 1) I just had surgery and was approved for the week off and didn\u2019t feel obligated to answer the phone 2) No other method was used to contact me or to see if I was okay because again my phone was broke (...more 4.0 Technical Support Advisor | Remote | May 29, 2020 Great pay, sometimes difficult job There are shift options such as 8 hours, 10 hours, or split shifts. Once you choose, and your situation changes, it's almost impossible to get a shift change. Training is 5 weeks total, and does provide a lot of valuable information. The job can be stressful as you are answering calls from customers with any number or type of issue. You have to discern if their problem is something in your own scope of support and assist them. If not, then you need to know what department they need to go to, whether you can cold transfer there, and what information to gather before transferring. It can be intense, and you have to be able to handle a constant influx of calls, never knowing what temperament is on the other end. I am on a contract where 98% of the customers are pretty awesome. The other 2% are the yelling, demanding, accusing type and it can be hurtful sometimes. You have to learn not to take it personally. You are expected to keep within certain metrics, like how long you take on calls, but they use an average, so even if you get a few long calls, the short ones will even it out. There is constant ongoing training, although some has been halted by the COVID-19 crisis. My biggest issue is having to stay seated for my 10 hour shifts. I like to move around and so this part is not working out for me. Otherwise, the job is great with plenty of pay and benefits, random raises, raises every time you train for another position, and tons of help if you get stuck on an issue....more ProsGreat pay and benefits, fully remote, they send you most of the equipment (buy your own headset $10-25), paid short breaks for the job, several weeks of training ConsPay is bi-weekly, job can be tough as it's customer service and tech support, must stay in office and seated most of the day Questions And Answers about Transcom Is there anyone applying for transcom recently? How long does the process usually take? I\u2019ve did the application, then received an email to do a written interview what comes next? Asked Apr 4, 2018 My interview only took 15 minutes and I was told by the recruiter an acquisition team would reach out to me in 72 hours. Originally told the interview would take 45 minutes but a I guess they can kind of can tell who will handle the position well and weed those people out first to not waste time.

Answered Jan 22, 2019 What advice would you give the CEO of Transcom about how to improve it? Asked Oct 16, 2017 Your managers and team leads are racist and prejudiced towards minorities.
