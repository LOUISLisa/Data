Watson 1.0 Licensing Specialist | South Jordan, UT | Feb 28, 2020 Stay away! If I had to summarize with one word or phrase to those seeking employment, still working there, or wanting to contract with Via Benefits, I would say: \"Run!\" One interesting fact about this toxic environment: When I quit, I LOST 5 LBS! I did nothing different except quit. In fact, I hadn't been to the gym in two weeks AND had been eating poorly! Just let that sink in. There are three major reasons why you should have nothing to do with this company: 1-The company is VERY money focused. 2-The company doesn't care about their employees. 3-The company doesn't care about their customers. Now a little more detail: The company's training is horrendous. The company has several different locations and training is inconsistent throughout. I felt as though the different locations might as well have been different companies for how different the training/policies & procedures were. Employees inadvertently give out wrong information or cause customers to lose funding permanently, etc. A customer could call into Via Benefits, ask a question, and get about 4 different answers. The sad thing about employees giving out wrong information is that there's a very poor system in place for punishment; it is essentially left up to the supervisor to punish the agent. There is such poor communication from management. One supervisor would say this and another supervisor would say that. An example is policy changes. Haha, this one is honestly such a joke. Policy changes happened...more 2.0 Investment Analyst | Chicago, IL | Jun 15, 2020 Diverse and Inclusive in Name Only Flexible office structure and relatively easy to work from home. Benefits are decent enough and one of the few companies that still has both pension and 401k plans. Investments department full of some very intelligent people you can learn from and has a relatively close-knit family culture who will accept you if you are normal enough and well-adjusted. Extreme warning to avoid this company if you have a disability. Made full disclosure of disabilities (in my case, primarily autism) and management did not take it seriously. If you have a mental disability, the company will work hard to keep it hidden and treat it as a personal issue, all but telling you to leave your autism at home because it's interfering with the workplace. Will refuse all reasonable accommodations and outright tell you that you should be able to figure out something vague like everyone else or they would not have hired you in the first place, even something as simple as \"clear and explicit directions.\" Refuse option to do an internal transfer to a position that would would be better suited to your skillset where you can perform better and provide value. Employees will also make it certain that there is a threshold for questions that are beneath them, especially senior employees which discourages new employees to ask them in the first place. They will keep disability hidden from everyone else so that co-workers can keep berating you when the disabilities get in the way and give you negative feedbac...more ProsEasy to work from home, decent benefits, each line of business is like a small family. ConsZero support for disabilities, minimal diversity among employees, senior employees assume that new hires know everything from the start, easy to feel like an outsider if you're not accepted, claim culture is welcoming and inclusive yet force everyone to stay within a mold, no room for creativity, treat requests for internal transfers as offensive. 4.0 Product Manager | New York, NY | Jan 16, 2019 Benefits platform product role You could do worse than WTW and you could do better. Some teams are phenomenal and would be 4/5 or 5/5 stars. Most aren't and that means that even if your team is amazing, you work with other people who are not great. Some of them are down right terrible. Opportunity to exceed expectations will depend on the team but BDA primarily is a great place to be. The benefits aren't the best but they are not the worst. WTW is oddly like that. The reason is due to an easy workload. No one at job level 58 or above (less senior) works much more than 40 hrs/wk unless something major is happening or their looking for some advancement. FLEXIBILITY You can work out of any WTW office or from home if your team is more relaxed. PTO Everyone gets 15 days of PTO until they work for WTW more than 5 years. There is a pension if you blindly want to sign your life away for 20 years of mediocrity. SALARY Salary at various job levels is based on what you come in at regardless of if you are at the low or high of your role's salary band. This tends to be non-negotiable so come in strong if you plan on working here. WTW will never bring you up to the industry standard if they got you at a steal. You will have to determine if your supervisor will fight for you to get a match from an outside offer. Raises and matching outside offers are different pools of money for teams. NEGOTIATING JOB OFFER There is nothing outside of base and bonus that can be negotiated barring extenuating circumsta...more ProsRelatively relaxed with ample opportunity to go above and beyond ConsSalary, vision 3.0 Seasonal Associate | Tempe, AZ | Feb 9, 2018 No benefits for most employees because most are not \"permanent,\" no matter their tenure. Seasonal benefit advisers get trained in early summer for the Medicare sales season. There are many insurance company certifications to complete before the sales season starts, and this is a stressful period. Essentially all customers have health reimbursement accounts, which makes the selling of plans easier. People call during open enrollment, you assess needs, and get them into plans that will serve them well. I learned about health reimbursement accounts and about many different insurance company offerings. My supervisor helped me with computer applications and functions that I had never used before. Management is young, but smart. They pretty much come out of Utah, so they are a straight-laced and decent group. No scum bums at Willis Towers Watson! You can be PROUD to work there. Adherence is less strict than in some call centers, but they will call you on infractions. The caliber of employee is pretty high---no bedbug problems there!! The supervisors are absolutely fantastic and know how to help you---they are WONDERFUL. One of the seasonal trainers is older, and he is FANTASTIC, too!! The hardest part of the sales job is getting certified every year for all the plans--rubber really meets the road for this---it's stressful because you don't have control over when the certifications are available for completion. You may have to be working on many, in a short time frame, in order to be able to sell when enrollment begins. The most enjoyable part of my jo...more ProsGreat supervisors!! Good pay. Great desks/systems/resources. ConsNo health insurance for most employees. You don't feel like you belong. 2.0 Actuary | Dallas, TX | Nov 7, 2019 Too many hours, too little pay, toxic culture Actuarial Service Center Work: The average day is tricky to describe because it varies so much. You work on multiple client teams and each team has different projects. The variety is the only positive in this job as it is interesting and challenging work and doesn't become monotonous. The work is very technical, so expect a large learning curve. Hours: The hours here range throughout the year, with different peak seasons depending on what clients you are assigned. If the work is distributed properly, the hours on average should be 45/week, except for the busy seasons which average 55/week. This is not usually the case and as management has stated \"work comes to good people\", so the reality is if you do good work on your client teams, you will get more and more work to the point of being overloaded. Then when you ask to offload some of your responsibilities because you are drowning in work, management will reply with \"stop being so good\" and ignore the issue. Workplace Culture: When I first started here, the group was very collaborative and welcoming, but as the group has grown it has become very toxic. The only way to get any help with hours and pay is if you butter up management by participating in harmful gossip. The lack of professionalism in this office is staggering. The fact that the one of the leaders of the group talks so much about people, even going so far as to make fun of how some coworkers look, is uncalled for and disappointing on many levels. Pay...more 1.0 Customer Service Representative | South Jordan, UT | Dec 31, 2019 not that great of a place to be They DO NOT offer permanent positions for YEARS!! You can be working there for 5 years as a temporary employee. They treat employees awful. They do not accept Doctors notes, as someone who has a medical condition and needs accommodation my supervisor did not help one bit in trying to get me some accommodation. You are treated as a number and supervisors are down right rude and are very two-faced. Supervisors will go and tell one person one thing and then tell you another thing. They have an awful point system and you cannot go above a certain amount of points or else you get written up and have to be put on a \"60 day look back,\" you also get double points if you call out or leave early the day before or after a holiday. They really look down upon leaving early or calling out (even if you are sick), they also will not send you home unless you are sick, you literally have to throw up at your desk before they consider you \"sick enough\" to be sent home. Each department is treated differently even though they all have the same rules, some departments follow the rules closely and will write you up if you do the wrong thing and other departments could care less what you do. Supervisors are lazy and do not give adequate coachings or good feedback. You are just a number and unimportant to them. You are also dealing with senior citizens who can be very grumpy and disrespectful towards you as a rep and no one does anything about it. And communication between departments is awful you hav...more Prospay is decent Consmanagement sucks, company is ran poorly 3.0 Associate | San Diego, CA | Jul 16, 2018 Constant Change Worked at WTW for three and a half years. I appreciate that I've been given the opportunity to take on new roles as I worked my way up from processing client tasks. You do gain learning experience from working with well known clients and learning from talented team members (depending on the team you are assigned to...). I can say I was able to obtain accomplishments from handling high volume, detailed client projects from start to finish. However, the workload can be VERY stressful during open enrollment, with little to no work life balance for the last few months of the year. Since the merger, the reporting structure of the client teams has obviously changed, and reporting to a new \"manager\" in a different state I find takes out the personal relations of developing your role or \"career path\", especially if they don't work with you directly often or interact hands on with a specific client project. I think this also divided the culture within the office. Regarding pay, I've also taken on considerable responsibility with a level change, and not even a shift in my pay range - not cool. Although with the new \"career path\" being rolled out, I feel opportunities for real advancement to other advanced roles are limiting, unless you actually put yourself out there and prove your credibility to the higher ups, and even if you get promoted, if you can't deliver then why bother. The culture has a slight air of competition that may not be immediately apparent, but you do ne...more ProsIndustry Experience to add to resume ConsLow Pay 1.0 Analyst | Nashville, TN | Jan 22, 2019 Bad experience in Nashville Micro Management at its finest! I have worked for (6) companies over the course of my career, and my experience with WTW was one of the worst career choices ever. Within my first 30 days of employment, I received about 4 hours of systems training with team members and about 2 hours of training with the Team Lead. MICRO-MANAGEMENT to the point of harassment. You better not be (1) minute late in the morning, back from break, lunch, etc. or it will be documented and reported. Do not leave work (1) minute early or it will be recorded as an occurrence. Each tardy is an occurrence. Get (6) in a 12 month period and it is a written warning. Management expected for you to be at your work area 15 minutes prior to your start time. But do not clock in until your shift starts. What? Is that legal by Labor laws? If you are late for ANY reason, you have to personally call Management and give a detailed explanation as to why. Management will even discuss and disclose personal employee information with the team! Highly unethical and unprofessional behavior. Extreme backstabbing and complaining by employees and Management created an unbearably hostile and low morale work environment. Most employees were like robots and rarely said a word except with their buddies. Say more than Good Morning and it becomes a MAJOR issue for everyone. Company promotes ethics, respect, teamwork, integrity, world-class training, work/life balance, etc. but NOT TRUE at least in Nashville. EVERYTHIN...more Proslocation, cafe, lots of benefit choices ConsManagement, lack of training, constant computer issues with no resolution 2.0 Benefit Specialist | Mount Laurel, NJ | Mar 14, 2020 Dystopian nightmare Coworkers, management, and the job itself isn\u2019t so bad. I liked the learning opportunities and in depth training. My problem lies with the company itself, who does things like push SLA\u2019s that allow no room for error in order to keep the extra money in their pockets, so employees will get \u201caddressed\u201d for things like going to the bathroom or needing a moment after stressful calls, even though during training your managers will advise you you can use this personal time no problem. I think it\u2019s borderline abusive how contractors are treated. They manipulate and threaten that you need to have perfect attendance in order to get converted, which provides no clear path or timeline, anywhere from 6 months -2+ years\u2014 it\u2019s all kind of a blurred line and out of your hands if/when you get brought on to the company so basically it\u2019s up to your upper management if they like you or see you as beneficial to them. Which is obviously not what management will say, they make it seem like if you do your job well you have the in. Wrong. I have definitely seen people with poor attendance get brought on. How do you sleep at night? This is peoples livelihoods. We are adults who come to work every day and try hard and this company made me feel absolutely disposable like I was just a 1 in a million number that doesn\u2019t matter and could easily replace if I don\u2019t grovel at their needs. Also the whole monitoring every second of your life is a bit weird and felt like I was in an George Orwell novel. ProsDecent pay, learning/training opportunities, very diverse colleagues ConsHorrible work life balance, no room for error, questionable conversation timeframes 1.0 Processor | Mount Laurel, NJ | Sep 12, 2019 Training very Poor and immature and some people get special treatment during training. They treat you like a herd of cattle. Very poor training. Unfairness all around. They don't have the guts to talk to you face to face. They hide behind their computers and email everything without ever communicating with you in person. You could be 5 feet away and they walk by then email you something they should speak to you about. I asked questions about how to put a PTO override into WFM and they don't even answer. Then they cut you out of a job through a phone call when you get home from work from someone you haven't ever met. When all along they knew as they saw you throughout the day. Instead of helping they set you up to fail unless you are someone from the beginning that they want to stay. Discrimination by helping their own, so they are the majority, but I will not speak to exactly what I experienced because I may contact a lawyer regarding the treatment at this company. I sat there while in training and watched a supervisor help step by step a new hire, when I needed a question answered they walked away. They help their own because they want to be the majority. Totally racial place. The discrimination is off the hook. And I felt like I was back in grade school when this is real life. A paycheck. They just toss you out when you go home at night with a phone call from someone you never saw at work. Because they don't have the professional mature way to handle their employees. Very immature unprofessional management.
