I will be forever thankful to the management and bosses who saw my potential and allowed me to contribute to their companies' success. 5.0 Carpenter | Oregon City, OR | Oct 15, 2013 GREAT FAMILY ORIENTATED WORKPLACE Get up at 4am, leave the house by 430. Clock in at 6am 60 miles later, and get started by doing stretch and flex. I learned over the years to show up early and get prepared for the days work ahead of time rather than rush at the last minute and risk making mistakes. It is a good way to start managing your time for the day and get on the same page with your co-worker and discussing your tasks that are being performed. Make sure everybody has their head in the right place. A smooth running day can be the hardest nightmare if a avoidable mistake gets somebody hurt. WE ALL HAVE FAMILIES THAT LOVE US AND DEPEND ON US. And to have the satisfaction of doing a good days work for a fare wage and go home to their loved ones, and share that with them, is the best part of the day. ProsGood insurance, Good wages, Work with your hands, Great friends ConsLong commute, Seasonal work, High gas prices 4.0 Truck Driver | Florence, AL | Jan 7, 2016 Commercial construction From demo work involving hammer drills and sledge hammers to building forms and pouring concrete including some finishing. Hard work from the beginning of the day until the end of the day. Driving aerial lifts and all types of forklifts. 5.0 Journeyman Carpenter | Pittsburgh, PA | Aug 3, 2019 It is a life style Been union carpenter for 20 years with much of it specializing in industrial scaffold. Depending on your area work goes in waves with booms of 5 to 10 years then slow work for up to 5 years. The term journeyman is not just a name but a requirement to work steady for those that do not stay with one company or in one facet of the trade. If you are willing to go where the work is you can make over $100,000 a year chacing outages and big jobs across a region or the entire country. If you are looking for a 9-5 always local job this will tend to not be for you. There are times that you get laid off and will collect unemployment for weeks. Currently in western Pa/Pittsburgh we are in the early middle of a 10 to 15 yr boom where a fair carpenter will make around 50,000 plus a year plus bennies and if you are willing to put hrs in some projects will get you well above 100,000 a year. Training is second to none in the union and benifits are great. Layoffs can be bad but personally I like to get a few weeks of unemployment a year to regroup and unwind with family after jobs on the road or 50 plus hr a week local jobs. 2019 western Pa is in great need of qualified experienced carpenters. Call KML region carpenters ProsGreat pay and benifits. Can provide great life for you and family ConsNot easy work and can be dirty. Strong back and mind required as well as strong work ethic 4.0 Journeyman Carpenter | Western, NE | Oct 7, 2014 I enjoyed carpentry,you could always see the project progress, enjoyed the challenge of beating the scheldule. As a carpenter you would perform a variety of jobs from rebar templates to driving pile coming out of the ground, to hanging pictures and bathroom partitions at the end. I learned to manage and estimate peoples time and material, also the foresight to know what we will need six months from now. In construction you learn to deal with all sorts of people, from educated to just out of jail. You will soon learn to use people assets to accomplish the task at hand. The weather and physical/mental requirements were most challenging. There always was a sense of pride pointing at something you built 25 years ago that is just inspiring today as it was then. ProsGood Benifits, Ability to go by that building and say I built that from the bottom to the top, healthcare Consas soon as you started a job you were pulling yourself out of another job, weather and physical demands 3.0 Interpreter | Albuquerque, NM | Mar 25, 2013 Great job when there is work Lay out your tools out for the day and be safe, proffessional, and productive. Management and safety is great. Co-workers are all professional. The hardest part of the job is when you are laid off because between 2004-2013, there is a waitng list of 100+ people for employment and unless you know someone or know someone who knows someone, it will be difficult to get the jobs that last longer. Prosgreat benefits, great pay, unemployment options, trainning Consonce they lay you off, unless you know someone, it's difficult to get work 5.0 Carpenter | Coopersville, MI | Feb 2, 2016 A great job to further your skills and apply inner knowledge. I have learned numerous skills and work ethics while working at this company. My co workers were very inviting and open to help. 3.0 Journeyman Carpenter | Indianapolis, IN | Jul 15, 2019 Overall it was ok. It was a good job but with all of the benefits and union dues it took out. It left me with under 350 dallors a week. I would have to drive over a hour to work everyday. It was not worth me staying at that job. When I would have to put almost half my paycheck into my gas a week. ProsGood benifites ConsTo much money to travel 4.0 Clerical Assistant | Horseheads, NY | Apr 9, 2014 Co-workers are easy to get along with Everyone here is easy to get along with. Most members are friendly and easy to assist. Some can get difficult to talk to. There is a lot of down time. 5.0 Benefit Specialist | Philadelphia, PA | May 4, 2020 Management This work environment from interview to the actual work has been pleasant Very relaxed environment , great mangers and co workers .. Everyone welcomed me with open arms and was very easy to get along with . The culture and work environment was awesome ! Great benefits , great hours . This was a refreshing experience after being in a position that was all about metrics and not at all concerned with their employees. Questions And Answers about CARPENTERS UNION On average, how many hours do you work a day at CARPENTERS UNION? Asked Feb 19, 2017 On Long island and in NYC the contract is either a 7 or 8 hour day. If the contract calls for a 7 hour workday, the 8th hour and anything beyond is automatically overtime. If a job is behind or has a tight schedule, you can easily work 7-12 hour days a week Answered Jun 22, 2019 Usually 8. If your on an overtime schedule it could be 5-10\u2019s and an 8 or 6-10\u2019s or 4-12\u2019s and an 8 depends on the contract. Answered May 29, 2019 What is the vacation policy like at CARPENTERS UNION? How many vacation days do you get per year? Asked Jan 25, 2018 90 days. Your medical fund is a set aside paid based on a hourly contribution into a individual union medical insurance account. Once the 120 hours of contribution is in the account, the coverage begins and continues based on the minimum hours needed to continue the coverage. The more you work, more hours in the \"bank\". So if you're off due to weather or between jobs your banked hours continues your coverage. Answered Jan 2, 2020 Ok so on Long island and NYC, you get $5 an hour(Li) and $8 an hour(NYC) for every hour that you work put into a vacation fund. So technically if you take off a day or a week, you get paid nothing at the time, but if your working steady on Long island you will get 2 checks a year for about $4500 each. The city gives you 4 checks a year, and they are about $3500 each. Now that's for a typical 40 hour work week, if your working a ton of overtime, those checks can easily go up a few thousand dollars.
