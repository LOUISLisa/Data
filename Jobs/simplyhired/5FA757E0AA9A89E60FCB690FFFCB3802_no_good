After that, I would conduct on occasion the morning meeting with the shipping/loading teams giving them updates on the previous nights work and any other pertinent information necessary. At the conclusion of the meeting, I typically would finish my spread sheet on the previous days errors that we received and then browse the routes for the night from transportation. This was to see if there were any changes benefitting both the warehouse and the driver with each of our daily motions. For the rest of the day I would periodically checking on my grocery selectors and my emails to see if there were any issues that needed my attention. If there were any issues that needed more than my attention I would pass them along to my direct supervisor. Over the course of 7 years working for GFS, I learned how to build relationships, manage more people than I ever thought I could at one point in my career and how to serve my employees, and customers, with the best service possible. When I was a leader in our Ocala facility, the management team there was flawless. We had a perfect unity and understanding on how we all wanted the warehouse to perform and how we wanted to satisfy our customers.

A typical day at work, I'll show up and count my drawer. Then I'm assigned a register and I spend the day having great interactions with a variety of customers. In down time, I'll carry out any tasks the managers give me, varying from cleaning to restocking to making phone calls. I've learned to go above and beyond for the customer, every time without question. There is always an answer for every question the customer may have, and if it takes a while to find it, you keep trying. I've learned how to handle difficult customers and how to graciously thank the nice ones. I've learned the proper way to give great customer service. Management is always wonderful. They care about you as an employee and a person. They make sure you're healthy, and that any concerns you have are dealt with immediately. If you want to learn something or discuss an aspect of the company, they will always find the time to teach you or talk to you. They have a good clear communication amongst themselves and all of the employees. They make sure you are recognized when you do something well. And if you do something less than satisfactory, they make sure they discuss it with you privately and in a constructive manner. My co-workers are the best co-workers I could ask for. Everyone that works there is friends. We talk outside of work, and we make each day fun. Everyone works together and everyone is willing to help one another no matter what.

However, they are rapidly deteriorating and losing their direction. The company provides food distribution to businesses in many states and operates over 174 retail stores carrying the same food products as they deliver. The stores themselves have begun changing direction, trying to become more of a Whole Foods Market with individual produce items, smaller packages of fresh meat, and expanded bakery items. These items are not what the customer base wants and the stores are writing off hundreds of dollars in spoilage each week. Customers who used to count on the GFS store for their event planning and their bulk needs are now left out in the cold and are confused. Many are shifting their business to other wholesale stores. The company itself is privately owned and used to pride itself on employee benefits and personal touches. Employees used to receive birthday gifts, bonus incentives, opportunities to win sales contests, etc. All of that is gone. The company is now out for the bottom line with their huge investment in produce and facilities that are rapidly losing money. In addition, they have had several recent employment practices lawsuits that cost huge $$ in settlements, mainly involving the hiring discrimination practices of women in their warehouse facilities. This is a fine job if you are looking for part time income at minimum wage, but don't expect much more pay than that. Raises are only offered once...more ProsFine for minimum pay job. ConsExpect to work hard with little reward, no bonuses, no employee incentives, unstable vision and mission, rapidly deteriorating in employee relations, several discrimination lawsuits. 4.0 Customer Service Representative | Dayton, OH | Jul 6, 2013 Friendly Atmosphere, and Great Staff A typical day at Gordan Food Service would consist of assisting customers with any questions or concerns that may be brought to the attention of the staff, Answering telephone calls, and completing daily task that management has for the sales associate. Working at Gordon Food Service has taught me that running a large Corporation is very difficult. Especially when it comes to Customer service. Understanding that not every customer is going to be in a great mood and that not everyone you work with is either. At all times you absolutely must remain professional and not let your views or moods get in the way of what (GFS) stands for. (GFS) has also taught me being organized and knowing product is key in being successful in sales. The Management at GFS was Great! Not only are they very understanding of things that may come about outside of work, they are more than willing to work around these issues. At times management can be a little demanding, but they will never have the staff do anything that they couldn't accomplish themselves. My Co-workers are like family. They have their days where their personal lives may affect their moods at work but for the most part they all are using (GFS) to propel them further in life, and are a blast to work with.

They think their \"culture\" is going to change the every person they touch. Reality is you either follow what they say or you will be replaced!. When you are part of a buyout you will notice more and more employees are let go and replaced with \"new\" GFS employees. Very few make it from the original company no matter how good you are unless you are willing to \"drink the cool aid\" and become one of GFS drones. As a salaried employee your time is their time so expect to on call 24/7. Management is clueless, my manager didn't have a clue what I did day to day. After a buyout he was put in charge of the division. Rather than learning what we did and needed he threw the division aside to focus his personal gain in another area. No matter how well you do your job when GFS says your time is up you're gone. Closing entire division without even a thought of the employees. This is after they pound in your head what a valuable asset every team member is. When problems arise you can expect to take the blame and then be coached because the communication is poor. Many emails about their culture, subliminal religious massages in emails, long worthless meetings. They like to throw around their humanitarian aid, the money they donate, pictures and videos of the elite sales force (that drank the cool aid) etc. Look around at the USA and see where the aid is really needed instead of the 3rd world countries.

The pay is pretty decent, definitely a lot more than other warehouses will give you. Its a dirty job, but if you show leadership that you want to be there and have that \"drive\" to push through and succeed, they take notice and will help you get to where you want to go. They have a growth and development plan for everyone and for the most part, stick to it. You have to remind them a few times to make sure you get cross training opportunities, but I don't blame them when so much is going on. They like when you take the initiative and show you really want to move up there. They have already helped me and cross trained me on other things and I have a development plan going for leadership. If you can tough through the bottom of the food chain for a little bit, it will be worth it. They are a family here and will help you move and grow within the company if you want to put in the effort. The only thing that I can say I haven't liked is as they have grown a little bit, they have taken a few things away, but they still give us plenty more than a lot of companies. ProsAlthough christmas and thanksgiving bonus for working on those days, they have made it double time which isnt entirely taking it away..hire from within, care about your future there, family atmosphere, good pay and many incentives.

As a route driver you unload upwards of 900 units over up to 12 locations, maybe even more locations. That's probably the most extreme route there would be. On average my day would consist of up to 600-700 items and maybe 9 stops. If it weren't for the pallets being mixed by stop I don't think I would have ever had an injury. The items are picked and stacked by the warehouse staff, and they are paid incentives to pick orders fast, not always taking into consideration that they put an item for the first stop at the bottom of a 6-7 Ft tall pallet. You could be pulling off stop 2 3 and 4 from the top of the pallets and have to repeatedly move those cartons several times before delivering them. Now when you consider there are 600 items you might touch each of those cartons 2-5 times. I honestly love the job. I like the physical aspect. I like all of the coworkers I've met, everyone is very friendly and give great advice. I liked driving and making the deliveries at night, learning maneuvers to get in and out of weird parking areas. The paid time off is awesome, the bonus pay is good if you can ever reach the goals. The one thing which seemed hard to find out, is what the mileage pay is and what the carton pay is.. they set you at a weekly guarantee of pay and if you go above the mileage or carton pay you would get paid more.

They pay okay for the workload. Mornings start out by unloading the pallets off the truck and then breaking them down into their respective areas on the shelves and backstock. Then the rest of the day would be spent working on backstock and store upkeep while tending to customers. The dry section was the best part of the job and was often the easiest, managers never expected day shift to finish their work until 12pm. Working the cooler section was also pretty good as the workload is typically light and not stressful. Slicing can get pretty busy though which was a downside. Freezer was hands down the worst part of the job and the job I often found myself stuck with since nobody else would do the job. Managers refused to place me anywhere else despite polite requests for different shifts or would promise the possibility of working another area without much prospect in doing so. pallets can take time to break down and managers are not often happy that customers can interfere with the time it takes to break down. The regulars from the store are very nice and will often remember you by name and don't need much assistance besides delivering their product. Schedule conflicts were often because the company cuts the number of people on any given shift down as low as possible so finding replacements are tough. Prosdecent breaks, decent pay, nice customers Consgetting stuck in the freezer is not pleasant and you will be kept there if no fuss is made. 2.0 Assistant Store Manager | Ohio | Nov 2, 2016 A Floundering Company I started at GFS and loved the culture and the compensation. It was on par with or better than other retailers. The benefits have been better at other places, but they are not bad. However, while interviewing I asked specifically about home/work balance and flexibility of scheduling. What I got and what I was promised were two very different things. Management at the corporate office is for the most part kind. However, most of them have been with GFS in one way or another for decades. This means that they are often ignorant of trends in retail as well as competitors. While they are great at what they do where they do it, it seems as though they are unaware that they are minnows in an ocean full of sharks. This has lead to some very poor decision making lately. There is also no job security. Several positions have been eliminated from the top down, and this is a company that seems to be in panic mode. Unfortunately, there is a high saturation of competitors in not only wholesale and restaurant clubs, but food delivery services. These competitors are outcompeting in selection, price, and availability. I do not see this company lasting in as it currently is much longer. I do not recommend coming on as a new hire. It looks very uncertain which positions remain with the company, which locations will remain open, and what new compensation will look like.

I started out as a dispatcher in transportation, after a few months in that role I was asked to join the marketing department because my skillset was a better fit for myself and the company. Joining the marketing department was where I experienced that the Cornerstone Values of the company didn't exist. There are managers that are certainly not qualified for their roles they simply have tenure or relocated from another GFS location. As a result the performance results of certain departments/teams are show it. Well after I joined the marketing department a few months later I and other colleagues in my department were blindsided by a \"company restructure\" plan. We were told here is what is going to happen to with your jobs....they are going away...After that meeting we were told not to discuss with anyone and it's business as usual. We were giving the option to reapply for new roles that were created under this new restructure, but we would have to compete against our counterparts throughout the company. Keep in mind we were the newer employees to the company, and were up against some 10-20 year veterans. Speaking for myself I believe this \"restructure plan\" was pre planned and the employees for the new roles were already selected. This is about all I will say so, Please dissect this experience carefully before considering. ProsGreat People, Profit Sharing ConsPoor Leadership Questions And Answers about Gordon Food Service What is the work environment and culture like at Gordon Food Service? Asked Aug 5, 2016 It is hostile and toxic. Answered Feb 24, 2020 When we ask employees about what is different at Gordon Food Service, the culture is what comes up most frequently. People really connect -- both with their leaders and their co-workers. Those that are customer facing, like our delivery drivers, store employees, and Sales teams also connect to our customers. There are great stories of how these relationships grow over time and increase the camaraderie within and across teams. Gordon Food Service employees really get to know each other as people. Beyond the culture, the work environment varies with the job. Our warehouse workers and delivery drivers have very physical jobs; they get a full workout without ever stepping in a gym! Most drivers are up really early to start their routes before dawn, but most are also home every night and those that do run overnight routes have hotels and don't have to sleep in their cabs. Our store employees work at a really fast pace as well -- that's retail! But most like the fact that Gordon Food Service has more limited hours of operation than a lot of retail (earlier close in the evenings and closed on major holidays). We also work with our store employees to provide flexible schedules that allow them to attend classes or manage other commitments. We would encourage anyone considering a role with Gordon Food Service to ask questions throughout the process to ensure a good fit. Social media is a great place to start, but get a balanced perspective by collecting more feedback as you meet our teams. Answered Sep 10, 2019 How often do raises occur at Gordon Food Service? Asked Oct 4, 2017 Annually. Even top performers should never expect more than 2%. Answered Feb 24, 2020 Gordon Food Service\u2019s compensation philosophy is to help maximize the recruitment, performance, and retention of high performing employees.

Answered Jan 3, 2020 What tips or advice would you give to someone interviewing at Gordon Food Service? Asked Aug 9, 2018 Walk away fast! No....RUN! Answered Feb 24, 2020 We would recommend doing some research on the company- it's always good to know about the company you're interviewing with. You never get another chance to make a good first impression, so dress at least business casual (if not professional). It's always good to dress a level or two above what the dress code is for your position- if the dress is casual (warehouse or drive roles) you should dress business casual. If you're interviewing for an office position where the dress is business casual- make sure you're dressed professional. Lastly we do behavior based interviewing- so research that! We're looking for specific examples of times when you've handled situations. Follow these simple tips and you'll be ready! Answered Jan 16, 2020 Do they drug test? Asked Apr 26, 2017 Gordon Food Service adheres to the guidelines set forth in the federal Controlled Substance Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) and remains a drug free workplace. For most positions, we do test for current use of drugs recognized as illegal at the federal level (including marijuana). This testing is not done until an offer of employment is made.
