We're a high-powered team consisting of about half physicians and half engineers, all of whom have dedicated their time to achieving our mission. As an early startup, we're looking for new team members who are excited about our mission and have the drive to thrive in the startup environment.

As a startup team member, you'll have a wide variety of responsibilities that will evolve as our needs change. Your primary responsibility will be to develop new features from initial concept to deployment. You'll also help provide support to our customers, including new or modified features and addressing technical issues. You'll be working on features within the VR environment as well as features in our standalone \"moderator\" application used by teachers to run our simulations.

Please also feel free to let us know if you have skills not listed here that you think would make you a great fit for our company. 1+ year of experience developing a mobile VR product (ideally on the Oculus Quest, but alternatively on the Gear VR, Google Cardboard, or other similar standalone VR HMD) Experience supporting a VR product that you have deployed to customers. Willingness to travel occasionally. Experience with 3D graphics (modeling, rigging, animating, or lighting, etc).
