Room for Improvement PAY The pay is honestly amazing for the amount of work you are actually doing. As long as you are competent and efficient in your calls, you can have a good income. As example, I am only a part-timer that probably averages about 25-28 hours/week, but if I were to continue throughout the year, I'm on pace to make around $38,000. So if I were a full-timer, I'd probably be looking at north of $50,000. Not bad for a job in Bryan, TX. However, one thing that greatly annoys me is how other agents from other locations will obviously game the system into making their metrics higher, making it harder for those who follow all of the policies put in place by management to get the bonuses and kickers for higher metrics. This brings me to my next point. MANAGEMENT In my and many other sales agents' opinions, the worst aspect of Wayfair. Your direct manager is usually nice and will help you out. However, there are so many managers who seem so incompetent and don't realize what foul play their agents are doing that are affecting others' bonus compensation. They are lazy, hardly helping you when you need assistance with a customer. They just say \"call Help Desk\" while they chat about nothing to the only other managers present. Above those managers, L3's and so on, are just as bad for other reasons. They can hardly ever just give you an answer straight when they change policies almost every week - either on how to handle certain calls, or how your compensation will change. They co...more 1.0 Senior Customer Service Representative | Bryan, TX | Sep 25, 2018 A candy coated ball of feces Potential employees beware. Do yourself a favor, and don't go to this interview you are about to have. Don't bother ever calling anyone back, answering another email, or wasting your time on this garbage company. You will be fed line after line of complete and utter lies. They will tell you how great it is to work there. They will tell you about their snack walls, ping pong tables, and serenity rooms. It is all a lie. Let me tell you what you are really in for with a job at Wayfair. You will start in a class room. The training staff at Wayfair is very good at making everything seem like you really are getting into a great gig. They will give you free shirts, cups, bag, and all the praise in the world over your first few weeks. Then, they will move you into what is called nesting. Here, you will actually be on the phones but still training. They will tell you how great you are and how far you will go. The will fill your head with ideas that you will be running the building in no time, that you are special. Then, once training is over, things go a little down hill. You will be on the phones and email systems dealing with irrational customers and problems created by the company's inefficiencies. It will be okay though, because the first level of employee is so over staffed that you wont be working that hard. It wont be great, but you keep telling yourself you can deal with it because you will be running the place in no time. Then they move you up to a skill level 2. That's w...more ProsSnack wall ConsPromotions do not exist, work force management couldn't staff correctly if their life depended on it, management is near useless, pay will rarely exceed $15 an hour. 1.0 Service Consultant | Bangor, ME | Oct 9, 2017 Just a miserable day to day experience This is a company that stresses throughout its recruitment and training period its commitment to customer service. This is an outstanding philosophy that they have failed to actualize. Queues for the inbound telephone customer service calls are regularly above 500, correlating with wait times for over 45 minutes. Imagine how you would feel if, upon receiving an item that requires you to talk to a customer service representative (known as a Sales and Service Consultants at this company), you then had to wait for 45 minutes (or more) just to speak to one. The metrics used to assess the SSC's performance were developed when there was no queue for inbound customer service, so you can imagine the futility of trying to achieve those standards today, when the first time you have an opportunity to speak to a customer, they've been fuming on hold for 45 minutes or more. Further, this company consistently fails to answer or address inbound email requests for customer service for a week, or more, even though they set the expectation for a 48 hour turn around to the customer. At the time I was working there, they actually cut the Chat medium of customer service communication, due to inability to employ enough SSCs to effectively address that, email, and telephone communication concurrently. Managers refuse to pick up the phone and help SSCs dig out of the queue. They hold meetings, and otherwise consistently find reasons to be unavailable - pretty much do whatever they need to do to lo...more ProsThe pros were all cheap, trivial, and did not offset the cons ConsPoor management, poor commitment to customers, terrible feeling of dread every day I worked here 1.0 Warehouse Supervisor | Perris, CA | Feb 18, 2020 OM doesn't practice what he preaches. A Prima Donna First off, When they have a sale it's mandatory to work 6 days a week. Many warehouses are like that especially in Retail. They should rotate the Supervisors schedule to be more family friendly. Then a new OM was hired and a few weeks later he accuses me of not telling him the truth about a conversation we had on Thursday. To top it off he confronts me about this conversation 4 days later which was Tuesday morning. I told how how am I suppose to remember a conversation 4 days ago. He stated in his record of discussion\" in my Workday that Honesty and Integrity are \"Paramount\". So then one of my Static workers gets hurt and receives First Aid (Ice Packet) who was suppose to be going to Army boot camp in a few weeks and I do the accident report. He (Operations Manager) doesn't turn it in or report it because he was afraid that would prevent him to join the Army. His very words were \"It's one thing to get hurt when you are in the Army\". They will take care of him. If you are broken before you go in then they don't want you. So he (An Operations Manager) deliberately doesn't report this accident. So much for this OM's Honesty and Integrity policy? It's to his convenience. This worker that got hurt missed approx 3 to 4 days due to shoulder pain and calls into the call off line and states \"I am real sore from the accident\". So this worries me because I wrote up the accident report and he is not turning this in. Would if upper management blames me for not reporting it? Then they m...more 2.0 Sales Consultant (m/w/d) | Remote | Dec 1, 2019 Oh well To be quite honest I feel cheated. I started working with Wayfair and I absolutely loved it. The salary was just about ok (could be much better and much more competitive), but the working hours were great, no weekends etc. Well, all that has changed. We work weekends in horrible rotations and no advice for possible changes is ever taken seriously. Well, it's easy, since upper management has their weekends off. That is what you get for being so high up, I guess. The workload is too much even on the best of days and requests for overtime to be able to follow up with customers or just get any extra work done are met with \u201eIf you cannot finish your work in your shift, then you should be better with time management\u201c. The fact that all departments are chronically understaffed is simply ignored. And while more and more people are needed, the ones who are great but were sick just one day to many are either let go or get short contract extensions. We are not humas at Wayfair and were there machines who could do the work, I do not believe senior management would bat an eye. We would be fired within a matter of minutes. Let's move on to the pay. German employees have to work with UK customers as well and are paid the same as Irish employees because (and I quote) \u201elife in Ireland is more expensive\u201c. Well, I have lived in both Ireland and Germany and I can assure you that it is not really. Especially since taxes are much more in Germany and the money we are left with is so much l...more 3.0 Customer Service Representative | Bryan, TX | Apr 22, 2020 allot of Hype without the follow through Job is almost cult like, you have to go through an indoctrination and completely buy into the culture. If you voice an opinion that does not go in line with how everyone else sees it, your treated differently. I have been in customer service management for over 20 yrs and in that time i have spent about 8 in call center leadership. I tend to look at things in a proactive way rather than an optimistic way and it was frowned upon. So much so that i was passed over for a supervisory position for someone with no degree, no experience and half my age. She was a very bubbly and optimistic person, where my approach is more, here is a possible problem and why....lets see how we can prevent it. I was actually told that i needed to be much more like her and that because of how i see things, i was \"not a good fit\". As i continued to look for a way to move up, several of the very problems i suggested we look at, came to life and the company as a whole was scrambling to find solutions. There was a suggestion site that we could log into and put those suggestions for areas of improvement to our corporate leaders. What the company failed to mention was that no one was manning the site, so those suggestions really went no where. The company's Core value is on providing an extraordinary customer service experience. They gave the customer service reps the power to solve problems for the customers and try to do what was right for both the company and the customer. Those abi...more 3.0 Warehouse Worker | Perris, CA | Jun 14, 2019 Great company, horrible management I started with this company 2 years ago. At first I loved it, health insurance provided from day 1, stocks allotted in increments of 20 per year and the stock has sky rocketed since I started, pay is adequate. The company has a great culture and a lot of perks such as free snacks and furniture raffle give away\u2019s. The CEO\u2019s have the right idea and they try to include employees in what is going on with the company. It is a tech driven company that is growing quite rapidly, maybe too rapidly. About the last 6 month\u2019s there has been a decline in job satisfaction among all the members of my department mainly due to re-structures in management. Upper management has become increasingly hands off, rather hiring inexperienced supervisors to micro manage, spy and report. Perks are going away or becoming increasingly strict. They did away with the furniture give always a few months ago, no one knows why. They have become very strict with our metrics and job performance while taking away our independence. Basically, we are all just a number. The most recent change occurred last week when they suddenly decided that our office position we were hired for had turned into a warehouse position. I didn\u2019t apply for a warehouse position, I never would have taken the job. They have taken most locations and placed them on the warehouse floor or in a warehouse office. The main part of our job is written communication between suppliers, the warehouse and customer service. We have a certa...more ProsGood pay, nice benefits, free snacks (this could be a pro or con since you will gain weight) ConsMicromanaging, poor guidance, horrible communication, no encouragement for a job well done only reprimanding when you don't meet your quota 5.0 Service Consultant | Bangor, ME | Dec 2, 2018 Wonderful, at First Wayfair LLC's office in Bangor is apparently doing a great good for the city of Bangor, Maine. They have hired many individuals that are interesting and personable. Training is intense, however, you emerge with a working knowledge of the systems and how you can express your autonomy through the work. I can't stress enough how wonderful it is that you are empowered to actually be kind and helpful to customers! However, after your first 120 days working there, they begin to obsessively monitor the details of your time and conduct (and the no-matter-what-the-computer-is-always-right, even when it isn't). Employees that have been with the company for a brief time are manipulated to believe that they can relax and socialize. It feels great. It is discussed among more experienced employees that this is meant purely to lower one's guard and to settle into a position that seems assured for life and offers a lot of advancement opportunity. You're encouraged to advance, but there is a thinly veiled implication that by choosing not to advance at every opportunity, you will be quietly gotten rid of. When you do advance, your tasks become a great deal more fast paced and difficult and you are actively encouraged to not express this to new employees. At the 120 day mark I mentioned above, you are monitored far more fiercely and mistakes are very suddenly much more impactful upon your evaluation. It is abrupt and it is both cruel and confusing. The contrast between this pressur...more ProsGoofy Costumes. Fair Benefits. ConsPressure: People aren't Coal, or Diamonds. 2.0 Customer Service Representative | Ogden, UT | Jul 31, 2017 Becoming a typical call center environment Forget thinking coming here would be any different than teleperformance, convergys, or Focus. Their culture was different, until changes were made that affected the workflow of employees immensely. Our voices used to be heard, and we mattered. Especially with constructive criticsm. We've had 3 major changes with our Senior management, who all but have eased our pain. They know nothing of our culture, nothing of our true brand, just hired because they were 'higher ups' from someplace else. When it comes to issues or criticsm we have, they do not know how to take it. Anytime before, it was understood that critism was always constructive on either end, never hurtful; that was our workplace. These new comers, didn't get that. Don't expect to come here thinking you'll know what your job is in your job offer letter. It will change. They claim to like transparency, but since the big change; we hardly get anyone to tell us what is going on anymore. We had individual Chat, Email, and Phone service departments. They decided based on a much smaller location that they've tested, to run what's called 'agility', or multi-channel servicing. They said it worked well at that site. That site, has less than 100 agents in their service dept, meanwhile theres the rest of the 6+ sites doing their regular functions. Of course this site is going to do well, Wayfair started training this new site and its new employees from the start with this agility role. Where you are doing all 3 functions: ...more ProsThe money doesn't even make this job worthwhile anymore, when you don't have any support. When you are shamed for how 'slow' you are being, and for the lack of morale. ConsToo many to list, and honestly I'm finding out more since I've been gone. The turnover here is going to be incredible. 3.0 Service Consultant | Bryan, TX | Jul 11, 2018 Wayfair - Either you do or don't With Wayfair, you either thrive or get stuck in the holding pattern. You either love it or hate it. Wayfair entices people in with these great opportunities and parades out their 'all-stars' in the beginning. These people are the ones who started when the site did and had far higher chances for advancement. Many of them shot up the ranks, and they love making it seem like you will too. There's a catch though. There are now metrics that regulate the performance reviews of all service employees, and these metrics were different (if existent) when these all-stars were in the same position. These metrics can be absolutely absurd. How so? There is a survey that asks one question and doesn't even reference you or the service you received, and yet the response to that survey can hold you back from bonuses and promotions because the answers are attributed to your performance. There is definitely an issue with employee morale. There is a lot of stress working in a call center, and the management is clearly not equipped in how to deal with the way employees process it. While the trainers are fantastic in addressing that there will be awful customers who will cuss you out and verbally abuse you, there is little to no managerial support once you are n the floor when you do come across these customers. Many times your own team members may be the root of the discord, but there is no option to move teams.

Questions And Answers about Wayfair If you were in charge, what would you do to make Wayfair a better place to work? Asked Jan 24, 2019 Support customer service agents Answered Jun 28, 2020 Include associates and department supervisors in the collaboration of process improvement. Hold upper management to a higher level of integrity and follow up. They hide a lot of errors, favoritism, nepotism, and inventory issues when the visits are planned. Talk to the associates when visiting other sites for inspections. It's the only way to get a clear picture of how things are when you are not there. Upper management is very inconsistent and it is very frustrating. I love working with my team and my supervisor. The benefits, perks, and pay are good! I love my schedule! It would be more fair if points for attendance were removes if a doctors note is brought in! People and their kids do get sick and it's not their fault. Wayfair has stepped up in a lot of ways during this pandemic. They have been very understanding and flexible with their employees. Overall, I enjoy working there.
