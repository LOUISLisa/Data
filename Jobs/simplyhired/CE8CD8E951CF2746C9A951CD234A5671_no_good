I happen to be fortunate to have diff skills. The management is basically yourself . So you can self destruct at anytime.Perfect place to develop self discipline.Some customers just dont know what it takes to get task done. Go slow paced and it can work... Beware of 1 hr jobs with 4 hr travel. set work area wisely.... 5.0 Handy Man | Jacksonville, FL | Jan 1, 2020 Pick and Choose your hours and jobs Task Rabbit allows work autonomy. Set up your preferences on the site, then pick your jobs, rates and days. Its like Uber/Lyft for home projects... Love it 5.0 Entrepreneur | San Francisco, CA | Oct 5, 2018 Flexible Tasks and Hours Better variety than your run of the mill Postmates or Uber app. You set your price, hours, location, etc. and I really like that you can work in most major cities. 5.0 Independent Contractor | New York, NY | Jul 27, 2018 Fleixbility Galore As a Tasker on the app you can tell that this is an extremely well run company. Great support as well as a constantly updating and improving platform on which to work. 5.0 General Contractor | Cleveland, OH | May 4, 2018 Independent Contract work on your schedule Task Rabbit is great because it helps with someone that needs a more flexible schedule. I also enjoy meeting a myriad of wonderful people in nearby cities. I learn something everyday doing tasks on the Task Rabbit app. ProsFlexible schedule ConsNo Healthcare 4.0 Housekeeper | Sacramento, CA | Jan 13, 2020 It Was ok. Nothing great . Not always a good fit...jobs were horrible especially when the job should have had 2 takers they never had two. So unsafe job practices 5.0 Independent Contractor | Philadelphia, PA | Mar 22, 2020 Rewarding part-time job. Outstanding opportunity for part time flexible work, I try to stay in the 15 hours per week area. I usually get at least this many hours; I could easily double that amount but 15-18 is my limit. I'm busy with other stuff. My hourly rate is terrific because I go the extra to maximize my client experience. To this point I have many repeat clients. I'm my own boss, I love the fact that it's on me to make it happen - it's my business! Customer support works for me totally, that's because I get the platform. I don't bring unnecessary issues for them to solve. By far most of the clients are really OK. 1.0 Event Staff | Charlotte, NC | May 6, 2019 They are bias against their contractors I\u2019ve been working on TR for 6 months. It took that long to finally reach elite status even though I never had one bad review, no cancellations, and my acceptance rate 100%. The review stating that all it takes is one client to ruin your metrics is TRUE. I declined an ongoing cleaning task for this problematic lunatic, and not only was she allowed to still review me (and of course she gave me a thumbs down), my reliability metrics went from 100 to 75%, and for some reason it dropped an additional 9% a few days later, leaving it at 66%. It tried contacting support several times, but they only allow you to do so through email. You can\u2019t speak to anyone over the phone or chat because they will end the conversation because it\u2019s not considered an emergency. Every response that I\u2019ve received asking for an explanation is not only vague, but automated. It\u2019s literally the same message VERBATIM, and all that they do is change the signature of different person. It\u2019s frustrating and not helpful. The lower your metrics, the less job request you will receive because they won\u2019t send clients to you and, of course no one is going to want to hire someone with a poor metrics, but keep in mind that it DOES\u2019NT take much to make you look horrible. Out of 21 reviews, I only had 1 bad one, and my percentage dropped a whopping 34%! Taskrabbit says that the encourage clients to leave honest reviews, but yet they don\u2019t allow honest reviews about their platform be publicly posted on their site. Contra...more ProsFlexible hours ConsVery poor customer/contractor support 4.0 Independent Contractor | New York, NY | Dec 3, 2019 Great platform for independent contractors This was a great way to have customers reach out to you for independent contractor work. Varying from private apartments, rental properties and commercial property's such as retail locations and restaurants. 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Los Angeles, CA | Nov 17, 2019 They steal from the employees and force them to work for free. THIS COMPANY IS A FRAUD. They routinely steal credit card information and sell it on the dark web. This company is a huge scam!! They routinely steal from customers and you will receive fraud charges left and right. They are unethical and do not respect the employees or the customers in any way. They will be on the news very soon. Questions And Answers about TaskRabbit Do u need to bring your own supply Asked Sep 13, 2016 Yes I do.
