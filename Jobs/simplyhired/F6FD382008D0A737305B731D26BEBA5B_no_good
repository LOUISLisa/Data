They don't care about personal. Leadership is no longer great and pay drop for an overseas contract company. ProsTime off ConsLeadership 5.0 Armed Guard | Reston, VA | Nov 14, 2019 Experianced Professionals I've been with Triple Canopy for over 2 years. I got out of the Army in 2010 and nothing I did compared to my experience while I was in. I'd say 98% of the company in HR have a military background. Everyone knows why we do what we do. 1.0 Security Guard | Desert, UT | Jun 23, 2019 Triple Canopy for then and NOT YOU First THIER medical program is a fund you start and pay into. Whatever is their after your hurt is what you have to get better. Second the hiring process is a job lol They want Ollie the Operator for average around 50,000 to 60,000 a year LMAO !!! Oh and that includes over seas pay or benefits. Third the tool that hired me knew ZERO about the military or even bothered to asked any valid questions about my trigger time. He was simply intrested in any currently qualifications I held currently so that they had to spend minimal in bringing me up to date. Four they want you to act like ur being hired by the CIA and bow down to them. Big time buddie circle baby either ur in it or out of it lol. ProsI quit ConsI was hired 5.0 Security Supervisor | Reston, VA | Oct 22, 2013 Great Starter company for any one getting into contracting. Very good company with outstanding reputation. great to have on your resume 3.0 Security Officer | Philadelphia, PA | May 28, 2019 awesome training higher up management and troops on the ground relationship are not healthy...which causes long term internal problems. training staff and procedures is top notch. 1.0 Security Specialist | Reston, VA | Jun 23, 2017 would not recommend Would not recommend anyone to work for Triple Canopy. Pay issues. Bare Minimum working equipment. Minimum training. Management does not take care of internal problems. Prosnone Consall of them 5.0 Protection Specialist | Reston, VA | Mar 15, 2018 triple canopy good company to work for just they are cutting the pay and there is no room for advancement and they do not pay for training and the quality of training is not good 5.0 Equipment Operator | Virginia | Mar 22, 2015 Contractor Life Pay is Great Management is....
