About The Nueva School The Nueva School, an internationally recognized, nonprofit, independent day school, has served gifted learners since 1967. Today, Nueva serves nearly 950 students PreK\u201312. Nueva is located in the neighboring towns of Hillsborough and San Mateo, equidistant between San Francisco and Silicon Valley, serving six counties throughout the Bay Area of Northern California. A constructivist school, Nueva is known for its distinctive inquiry-based interdisciplinary studies, project-based learning, and pioneering work in social-emotional learning and design thinking. The Nueva community instills a passion for lifelong learning, fosters social and emotional acuity, and develops the imaginative mind. Our school has received the US Department of Education National Blue Ribbon Award and the American Institute of Architects Award for School Design and Sustainability, has been recognized as an Apple Distinguished Program and appointed an Ashoka Changemaker School, co-founded the Common Ground Speaker Series, hosts the biennial Innovative Learning Conference, and was highlighted by the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning and New York Times best-selling author Thomas Friedman in his book That Used to Be Us in the chapter \"Average Is Over.\" About the Innovation Lab (I-Lab): Nueva's I-Lab program was built on the foundation that while we may not be able to predict what the world will look like when our current students enter the work force, we are confident that the ability to solve complex problems will never go out of style. In the I-Lab, students learn to embrace design thinking as a nonlinear process that provides mindsets and techniques to guide them as they tackle open-ended problems that do not have immediate, easy solutions. Through working with real problems and users, students develop their empathetic, curious, and creative mindsets while learning how to brainstorm, prototype and iterate solutions. Students in the I-Lab engage daily in the process of design, prototyping, making, and engineering, whether this comes in the form of developing a mobile app, writing code for a wearable device, or 3D printing a prosthetic. onTDKC0zYQ "
