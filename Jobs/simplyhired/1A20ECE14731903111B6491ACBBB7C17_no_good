Management operates by instilling fear. Ultimatums are constant. No consistency in schedule. No upward mobility. Look elsewhere 3.0 Data Entry Clerk | Euclid, OH | Dec 17, 2019 Fun place to work Productive and fun place to work, everyone get along very well. the brake room have a ping pong table, and basketball court. The company also provide uniform and have in place for employee to get uniform clean. 2.0 Inventory Associate | Blue Mound, TX | Dec 3, 2018 It was a nightmare Carvana does not help in arbitration cases they just try to get the person who brought the charges to quit...would be a great place if it wasnt for bad management 2.0 Customer Advocate | Tempe, AZ | Apr 5, 2019 Do not work for this company if you value your sanity This company pretends to be customer-centric but all you do is screw customers after selling them terrible vehicles. Although you are provided training when you start in any position in the company, you work with outside advocates with little to no training and any time you bring that up to leadership you\u2019re made out to be a complainer. Leadership does not take constructive criticism well at all and they promote from within based on nepotism and favoritism and not on performance. Everything is about maintaining an image of togetherness and congruency but under the surface it\u2019s pure chaos. There is mandatory OT and they hand out \u201cpoints\u201d for lateness and use of unscheduled PTO. Working at Carvana is like working in a fishbowl. Everyone who isn\u2019t in the inner circle is treated like a child and there is no accountability in terms of how the leadership team is handled when they make mistakes. It is a brutally stressful environment and working for this company made me feel like a terrible person. I had to quit just for my own mental health. Please do not work for this company. I know the pay and benefits seem worth it but in the long run they aren\u2019t. ProsFree food and fun activities ConsMicromanaging, poor treatment of employees, lack of opportunity for growth, stressful, and overall bad company practice 3.0 Administrative Coordinator | Winder, GA | Mar 24, 2019 Its and okay place to work. No Life balancing and working through the weedays and weekends Most likely Transporting cars.Learned administrative coordinator. Management is attitude is horrible they favoritism. they watch out for their people ProsDriving all kinds of cars, learning management ConsManagement, work more area without pay raise they pick their favorits 3.0 Training Specialist | Tempe, AZ | Mar 23, 2020 Great Values, Good Idea If you are coming in as an advocate go through that line for promotions. Going outside of the Advocate role, you will lose all of the company values , and your thoughts and opinions on how to better processes will be brushed off. There is no growth outside of the Customer Service departments. 5.0 Line Lead | Cleveland, OH | May 29, 2019 productive and fun place to work with basketball and ping pong bad fit for those who want to be home on time unpleasant commute for west siders limited compensation packages for skill level and lenel of commitment expected benefits were good Prosbasket ball and ping pong Consshort breaks 5.0 Logistics Supervisor | Blue Mound, TX | Mar 29, 2018 Team Building exercises My Time at Carvana was a great experience and the friends i've met i will cherish Home work and life are hard to balance with the schedule they want you to run ProsGreat people to work with ConsThe Schedule is Bad for home life and Family Time. 1.0 Operations Associate | Tempe, AZ | Jan 4, 2020 A disaster Not worth the mental stress. I would never recommend anybody to work here. There is a childish culture that prevents anything from getting done yet write ups are given when stat goals aren\u2019t met. The management shows absolutely no interest in working with their teams to grow. 4.0 Senior Customer Advocate | Jacksonville, FL | May 2, 2018 Great company but difficult work life balance. I enjoyed the culture that Carvana created for employees but the work life balance was very difficult to grasp. Your hours are very volatile and they change last minute. You can be scheduled to come in a noon and at 10pm at night the day before it can change to 6am. It is great if you have no life away from work and only work but if you have any other obligations outside of work they make it difficult to manage. Most opportunities for advancement come out of the home office located in Phoenix Arizona. Most opportunities for advancement in all other markets only happen when new markets open or when someone leaves a position. This company has a work hard and play hard attitude. It is a fun place to work. The company is revolutionary and there are lots of opportunities to contribute to the growth and development.
