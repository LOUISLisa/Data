So I was trying to find a local job. I saw an ad and the recruiter told me that it was a drop and hook, off 2 days(didn\u2019t specificy which days), and you would average $800-$900 a week. I get there...and find out that you are working 6 days a week, not five. The pay is .37 cents per mile(you will not be driving 600 miles on an interstate) You will be going to Walmart stores and sams clubs, most of the time you will be using backroads and driving in city limits. Again, you\u2019re burning your clock and not getting miles. You will typically visit 2 to 5 stores(many times a backhaul will be included) and each Walmart store requires you to be alert and attentive. You will have to have pretty good backing skills as well as very good trip planning skills to find out the entrances and exists to each Walmart/sams clubs store. You will then have to ring a bell and pray that an employee will respond and answer the door to let you inside of the receiving end(sometimes you will stand outside for 30 minutes to an hour in the cold/rain before you get a response). Remember that since you have 2 to 5 stores to deliver to, your trailer pallets are mixed up. You will have to confirm which pallet belongs to the correct store. You will do so by pealing stickers. Sometimes you have to remove certain pallets to get to the other pallets...again, for someone who was told this was suppose to be a drop and hook, no touch freight...my nerves was already running thin. They do not p...more ProsI can\u2019t think of one ConsPay and Work hours 2.0 Driver | Chattanooga, TN | Jan 3, 2015 Cheap, poorly managed company As a solo OTR driver, your experience of this company is completely dictated by your fleet manager, either they get you plenty of miles, and forget that your human and need to stop and shower/eat once in a while, Or they run you so poorly that you paychecks are less than $400 for the week. You are frequently looking for empty trailers, half of the locations they send you to do not have trailers, the other half are so beat up they are not road worthy, which usually requires at least 2 or 3 stops to find a trailer. Often they try to send you out of route, the complete opposite direction, and still pay you for the same miles for the load. There is absolutely no communication between departments, breakdown hold times are at least 30 minutes, often 1 hour, appointment times are frequently incorrect, detention pay is rarely, if ever, paid, and your paychecks are almost always missing some form of pay your entitled to. Running as a team or for some dedicated accounts, is the only way to make any kind of money. I drove teams for a good 5 months, we ran an average of 5,000 miles a week. Our paychecks were typically $1,000 a week, on a slow week we still made the same as running 2,500 miles solo. The majority of our loads were FedEx (Los Angeles to Memphis), and Amazon, great miles, great pay, Dispatch actually cares about you. However loads for Shaw and P&G, are often non-existent. They frequently sent 2-3 teams at the same time to Shaw, to pick up a load that doesn't exist. Se...more ProsFlat pay rate, Teams, Dedicated work ConsPoor communication, Constantly fighting for pay, Beat up trailers 1.0 Truck Driver | Henderson, NC | Dec 29, 2019 You Are Just a Number Typical day involves load assignment, pre-trip and clean out different truck everyday, drive to load assignments 1-4 deliveries per trailer. Dock and call customer to come to receiving and open doors to let you in the building up to 30 minutes wait time, start unload process, technically you do not have to touch freight, but the average load is never secured or loaded properly at the DC, the refrigerated freight falls over causing you to have to assist or extended your dock time to wait for them to restack or downloaded fallen freight to another pallet, and sometimes it's not even their freight it belongs to the next customer, the current customer is moving it out the way to get to their pallets and then they must put it back in the trailer after they've fixed it. You must remove all stickers from each pallet as proof of delivery and verification it was delivered to the correct customer. I have not learned anything, management is a joke, they are nice enough to get you in and during pre and post orientation, and then the nightmare grows. You do not have a set start time, it varies from day to day, the worst being they push you back up to 12 hours, messing up your driver sleep time and rest, because it's very difficult to wake up for a shift after a 10 hour reset and for them to tell you that your next assignment has been pushed back. Also, there is a MANDATORY 6th day every other week, they do not tell you this in orientation. With the mandatory 6th day, it never fails, eithe...more ProsIt's a job and I get to drive ConsEverything else 2.0 Company Driver | Ellenwood, GA | Apr 29, 2019 New Driver Although this company has flaws there is an upside to the company. Us Xpress offers company drivers college for themselves and their family which can help move up the corporate ladder. The companies day to day operations can be messy and frustrating for new company drivers. I myself have work more than 14 hours a day which included on duty driving and on duty physical unloading. When the math was added up for the hours of training it averages to 4-5 dollars an hour. That did not make me a happy camper. They did have me off weekly and placed in a hotel with complimentary breakfast but at first they misplaced me in a rundown motel which made me feel very unsafe and a bad impression of the company. The door seemed to had been kicked in at some point and didn\u2019t close properly, their was no free complimentary breakfast so I had to eat out and was upsetting. One call to the fleet manager and they were able to fix me up at a nicer stay with complimentary breakfast in just a few minutes. On the upside they are responsive managers. Training was approximately 175 hour long and it was stressful at times. Barely getting to shower, eat or really do anything. Unloading was the most strenuous pet of the job but could be the most rewarding. You get to interact with employees and get a bit of physical exercise. 70$ a day is not enough to live off a truck and to pay bills at home for a month. If you plan on joining this company be prepared. Great thing about Us Xpress is that i...more ProsCollege ConsStressful lifestyle 1.0 Company Driver | Jacksonville, FL | Feb 9, 2019 Us xpress ads on their website do not match reality First things first, if you are just starting out, go for it! Them or Schneider will do just fine and you can work for a year to get some experience. However, once you have been through 3 days of orientation, you will notice that nothing that you saw on their website promised you, truly applies TO you. Those things apply to the drivers that have experience - those that do, do not come to US Xpress...so ha HA ha? You can expect to be paired up and stuck with a random \"team mate\", which translates into someone that has no idea what etiquette is in a small and confined space! I mean, if you got a buddy that you know and can handle for weeks at a time - go for it! Otherwise, you are in for a real ride... We all were new once, which is fine, but the company's matching ability is this - close eyes, stick a finger up the nose and pick a name...taadaa = you've got a match! So, get used to smelling cigarettes if you don't smoke and small inconsequential things like that. Spoken or written, email or paper - it is like Christmas! You will find out once you are on the road woohoo! Bring air freshener and a sleeping bag. The 175+ hours is for the new drivers. However, if you have not driven for a little while, do not be goaded into signing up for a \"little refresher\"!! Driving a truck is like riding a bike, you learned to do it once, you won't forget it. And 175 hours to \"refresh\" yourself is...odd... Although, not odd for the company once you know this! You will be running TE...more ProsGood for newbs ConsPay, home time, culture, managerial behavior... everything that really matters 2.0 Service Coordinator | Springfield, OH | Sep 11, 2013 High demanding, stressful, unrewarding Service coordinators shift starts from 5am-5pm split amongst four coordinators covering a 24/7 schedule. The 12 hours are non-stop requiring your constant attention. Strong organizational skills are a must. Drivers will come in to write up issues with their trucks. I will have to create work orders to assign to the appropriate technicians. Constant flow of work requiring quick action and attention to details are a must. Management is constantly over ran with corporate reports & projects which the technicians take advantage of by taking their time on repairs. This creates unneeded stress for the coordinators. Corporate is constantly issuing out new standard operating procedures or reports that are both unneeded and a waste of time. They do nothing but hinder the workflow of getting units accomplished. Everytime these new procedures are issued they are followed for a week or two then are forgotten about. The schedule is the worst part of the job. It sounds nice working three and half days then having three and half days off, but don't let it fool you. Long 12 hours days full of stress takes a toll on your body and health. I am exhausted by the time I get out of work and can not find motivation to do anything. Saturdays are cut short because you have to get up so early Sunday morning to be alert and ready perform. Very difficult to schedule time with family & friends when they are all off on the weekends and Holidays. No potential for advancement, and advancement within the comp...more Prosnone Conswork holidays, long stressful days, lack of management, no individualism, difficult to get time off, corporate structure slows gowth & progress, no weekend for personal life 2.0 Professional Driver | Marion, IN | Jan 27, 2018 If you want to have a clean DAC don\u2019t even think about working for USX You will be working 18 To 20 hours a day. You will be falsifying your logs if you want to make decent money. You are encouraged to (forcibly) sleep at Dollar General stores. When you wake up and start working you are told not to sign on to duty until you are done unloading at the store you slept at. Your next stop may be as much as 4 hours away. The 3rd stop the same. 2 hours unloading at each stop. Then you have to drive back to Marion for your next load. Drive new trailer to store ( could be 4 to 6 hours away. Sleep at that store and repeat the above. You will never really get a 10 hour break. This is how USX schedules their deliveries. I have 2 years worth of trans flos which will absolutely prove this. My next stop is the Motor Carrier Safety Unit with the State Police. This company unjustifiably destroyed my DAC. There are accidents (5 within a 2 month period) that I know nothing about. I would have been suspended on the 2nd one. Fired on the 3rd. Meanwhile my license is clean as a whistle. Tried to point this out to both safety and legal departments and was stonewalled. Wrote to CEO 3 Times and never answered. It\u2019s like dealing with a government agency. Takes days to get a live person on the phone. Then they cop an attitude. Drivers are as a default always wrong. This has caused obtaining future employment next to impossible. A company called 10street handles exchanges of information. They use this to get around FRCA regulations and blacklist you out of finding a comm...more ProsI can\u2019t think of any worth commenting on.

So nothing is negative here. This is my experience with us xpress in my 90 days of working there. They lied about the pay. The advertisement was for Walmart dedicated route stating pay @ $1450 per week. I called the office to confirm and was told that all drivers there make at least $72000 per year. The contract that I signed said an average of $1200 per week and I did not .Dispatchers continuously interrupted my 10 hr break and my sleeping pattern. They also called more than 20 times in a row in one hour so I put my phone on do not disturb and then they started to call my wife's phone. Calling me like it was some urgency to make a run and then I when I would get to the yard I would have to wait in the office to get my assignment. I waited a half hour ,45 minutes. hour and a half and two hours on different occasions. Sometimes giving me a second run that was impossible to make it home or doing a backhaul to complete in my 11/14 hr period. I am a non-smoker and when given a sleeper cab - they were heavily smoked in and you could almost practically taste it and clothes would smell like it. Many of the trucks did not have registrations in them so they were not DOT compliant. Most of these trucks are slip seat and many are messy ,especially the sleeper cabs. One of the mattress that I saw and luckily I did not have to sleep on it because if I did it would have given me nightmares if I did.

Miles are not an issue (avg 2600-3100 weekly unless HT). FM is OK but the inconsistencies in communication is not good. I also opted into the VA apprenticeship program. After completing the necessary paperwork and waiting the 90 day processing period I discovered that my paperwork had never been processed. The person responsible for submitting that, no longer works there. Nobody thought to contact any of the drivers on the caseload of this office employee, so 4 months of wasted time only for a resubmission. It's just one dropped ball after another. Plus side is good trucks but trailers are few and scattered everywhere (even the leased Xtra trailers). Worst lease program on the market but what lease program is good? lol... 5 yrs only 1 complete lease payoff. That should tell you alot. Some admin jobs were given a $10,000 pay cut, bonuses suspended...what's really going on? Low cpm and lack of communication. Information I posted is not opinion formed but facts from administration and my own experience. Yes, I want to talk to the CEO but we don't have that privilege. Our \"legitimate\" issues are never addressed unless it's a small group living near the TN HQ area. Company started off decent but has progressively gotten worse. Get your 6 months or 1yr and hit the door. One more thing...I'm just waiting to read the contradictory comments from the company now. Great way to be heard.

Well, you can make good money on the DG account! Some weeks you can potentially earn $ 1800 to $1900 a week. Not every week. Average $1400 to $1500. There's three challenges. Making it to your store can be challenging in some cases. Tight turns, low clearance bridges, local weight limits on certain roads and so on. Pre planning your trip is definitely necessary. The next challenge is getting into your store .Whether or not you have to back in off the road, pull into the parking lot and blind side or sight see into your unload area. Thats why its important to make it a habit to arrive at your store in the position to where you can sight see into the store if necessary. Cars, lightpoles and other objects can be a challenge in some stores. The last challenge is your unloading area. You could be uphill, downhill, slanted to one side or another, steep ramps into store and much more. Your definitely working your 70. Tough account. Trailers can loaded poorly and others can be excellent. Loads can be in high demand one week and slow the next. You should be able to do a 800 mile run in two days. Not three or four. Typically It should take you one hour to do 700 to 900 peices. Not three hours. Give accurate ETAs. Always show up for work after your 34. Your attitude at your stores can play a role on how fast you can get out of there and off to your next stop too. Some managers are productive and others not so much.Be kind, polite and courteous.
