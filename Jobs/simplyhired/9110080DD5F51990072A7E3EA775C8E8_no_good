Management is continually looking for improvements with all phases with company operations a My audit review speaks for its self. Ryan Air is a very good company to work for. Upon generating an audit review, it explains the high level of managements interest to safety, Keeping good employees, providing competitive pay and benefits. The company provides very good training for its employees. The company management cares for their employees, especially if one becomes ill. ProsManagement has provided banquets for selected celibrations. ConsNone 5.0 Cargo Agent | Emmonak, AK | Dec 7, 2015 Fun aviation company Working at Ryan Air was my culture with my own culture depending on our performance of all of us in the company. If offered a job in the company I would go back anytime. Great company for aviation to work with. ProsMeeting daily online for next day operations ConsJim Kameroff 5.0 Expeditor | Anchorage, AK | Jan 3, 2018 Good place to work Good place to work in a diverse work environment.Steady work and have the ability to have a variety of tasks during the day so no two days are/were the same. 1.0 Assistant Supervisor | Berlin, NH | Oct 24, 2019 kids and arogants The worst company related to everything too many kids the boss had attitude no one offers help Good to start in aviation but don t stay if you join just leave fast Prosthey don t offer food or water on board Consyou need to take care of yourself they don t do 3.0 Assistente di volo | Essex, MD | Feb 18, 2020 stimolante conoscenza di nuove persone nuove lingue e nuove culture 1.0 Flight Attendant | Kingdom, NY | Jun 8, 2020 Don't apply. Bad working environment and working conditions. Low salary. Disrespectful managers. No food/coffee/tea for crew during work. Had to pay for our cabin crew training + uniform. Briefing time, delays, boarding and reboarding not paid. 3.0 Flight Attendant | Dublin, CA | Dec 16, 2018 average experience The work was average, but the time schedule was bad. It is very challenging to work for a company that does not think of much of their employees. I don't know how i lasted that long 1.0 Flight Attendant | Stockholm, ME | Sep 18, 2017 Un desastre de empresa Un desastre de empresa referente a los trabajadores,muchas horas de trabajo y muy mal pagado.Los auxiliares de vuelo son muy mal tratados,no comidas,no bebidas(bueno agua en la crewroom hay) ,salarios ridÃ­culos para vivir en cualquier base de las que tienen. AdemÃ¡s siempre estÃ¡n muy presionados con las ventas a bordo,es una verguenza.No hay sindicatos que puedan denunciar esto?????. No me extraÃ±a que los auxiliares de vuelo se vayan a otras compaÃ±ias ,por los menos serÃ¡n tratados como trabajadores. Ryanair ponte las pilas y trata al personal como se merece,comidas on board y pagar como se merece esa profesiÃ³n. Prospuedes hacer amistades entre compaÃ±eros Consno comidas, salarios ridÃ­culos 2.0 Flight Attendant | United States | Apr 7, 2017 Personal Overview Professional Environment, a portion of the world to search and seek. Relevant organization. Stressful most of the times. Working hours can be high, depending on the base you are. ProsGain Exprience ConsStressful 4.0 Flight Attendant | West Virginia | May 23, 2012 Fast past, highly energetic work place We start early in the morning, introduce ourselves to the other crew members, preparing the paperwork counting stock and getting the cabin ready for the passengers. You need to have a friendly and approachable manner towards staff and public. The hardest part of the job was the unsociable hours. The most enjoyable was getting to work with the public always meeting new people. I learned how to be organized with minimal space, work at a face past yet showing attention to detail. Prostravel benefits Consno health care Questions And Answers about Ryanair How did you get your first interview at Ryanair? Asked Oct 28, 2018 I wanted to be a flight attendant and I found an advertisement on the web, so I applied and the next day I received an e-mail about the assessment day. After I succeed, I was trained for 6 weeks. The policy of the training course was self-founded, so I have payed for the training course, but this policy recently changed because they needed more staff, so they made for free to attract more people.
