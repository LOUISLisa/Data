First let me tell you that this is a review of what to expect if you are interested in working at Stevens Transport. This is plain and simple what you will get from working with Stevens. I'm going to focus primarily on the new driver as that is how I got started with Stevens. I'm sure experience drivers will already know all about Stevens Transport as their reputation echos in just about every Truck Stop, Truck Shop, Distribution Centers and even on the bathroom stalls. So you are on your own! For the Newbies... - If you don't have a CDL and have never drove a Big Truck, I would say this is a good place to learn and get your CDL. - They do have a great skill course in their facility with probably the largest amount of space dedicated to train that I've seen compared to other CDL schools. - For the CDL School...you will get 3 weeks of schooling with an average of 8-12 hrs a day in a mix of classroom and actual driving, THIS WILL INCLUDE SATURDAYS! SHOW ME THE MONEY!!! Be prepared to go thru hard times during the first months of your training. Stevens pays you only $350 a week during all your training, This is basically \"Survival Pay\" because after normal income tax deductions that will come down to between $300-$320 a week depending on your deductions and if you are single or married. Don't forget to deduct the $22 for the CDL School and your pay can be down to $280, after that comes in the portion of the \"loan\" for the bus ride to Dallas and the money for meals...more ProsGood Place to Learn, Good Equipment ConsBad place to work. Bad management 2.0 Otr | Dallas, TX | Jul 16, 2015 bad communication, bad driver services, bad home time I narrowed my job search down to Steven's Transport and Werner Enterprises, and I went with Stevens because of their training program. I went to orientation in the middle of October. I was in a class of about 30 people. Once orientation was done we ended with a class of about another 30 people who were waiting for driver/ trainers. Because it was so close to the holidays, I didn't get a trainer until the week of Thanksgiving. Most of the trainers wanted to be home during the holidays so I ended up with 5 different trainers. I stayed on the road for 4 months going through the training program. Once done I had to beg for home time to take care of some personal business (3 days off). Once I got back to Dallas and went solo, they gave me and old truck which I didn't mind. But the truck had electrical issues. Sometime the lights would flicker while I was driving at night. Sometimes I would lose power when I shifted to reverse. After much crying (literally) and complaining, they finally gave me a new truck. I had no issues with the new truck. But, I started having issues with the communication problem at Stevens. The last straw for me was the last time I got home time. I got to the place I where I park my truck for home time and the place was closed. No security guard, no other Stevens trucks were there, the place was empty.Nobody told me anything. This was on a Sunday evening so Stevens only had the skeleton crew working. I called Driver Services and the guy told me to...more Prosgood training program when it works Conspoor communication and it's hard to get home after being out 3-4 weeks at a time 3.0 Driver | Dallas, TX | Jun 6, 2016 Only good for training proposes Stevens paid for my CDL and I signed a contract to work for this company for one year. I got trained in their training program and it was a good experience. But I have to say, the training pay is the worst, they also start taking all the money for loan payment and whatnot from the beginning, leaving you less than 200 dollars to survive for the next almos 3 month that the training can last. Once you start as a company driver, you are required to work 3 more month under what they called \"GRAD FLEET\" which also have a lot of restrictions. If you go in a team as I did, it will take you a lot of effort to get miles, THIS IS NOT A GOOD COMPANY FOR TEAMS so don't. Just to summarize, if you can pay for your CDL out of pocket, please do, then go to Stevens, work for then 6 month, no more than that. And after you get all the training, get out of there, you will be able to make a lot of money anywhere else. The office staff in this company is really lame, they have a lot of departments but there is not connection between then. The lack of organization will keep you from making money, and in order for you to make decent miles a week, you gonna have to become your own driver manager, dispatch, and all in between.

I was a Field Recruiter for Stevens and dealing with a certain female who is the sister and 1/3 ownership under their father is a real pain. The 2 brothers on the other hand are decent guys who are trying to make a business work. She has no filter and says what ever comes to her head. She has the complex of being the ugly fat girl in high school thet no one would address who when had the first chance of power decided to make anyone around her pay that was not her equal. If you get any compliments at all it a backhanded loaded compliment that in reality it not even close to a compliment. If she asks for your opinion. Beware, she really does not want your opinion. She only says it to make you feel for the moment that you are contributing. If you give an observation in private or in a group. She will cut you down to size and berate you infront of everyone. All she cares for in an employee is a YES person that only is task oriented and asks no questions. She cares not for your thoughts or opinion even if they are right and need to be addressed. Unless its her idea it does not exits. I have known this person for many years and she has never changed. Beware of what you sign when you are on boarding.

Good insurance ConsMicro Management like you have never seen before in your life. 1.0 Title not given | Dallas, TX | Nov 25, 2018 No mission statement; no teamwork; daily chaos My days are never the same twice. I learned to operate in an always changing; fast paced environment and how to give my best ability for satisfaction of customers only. When you show management your ability to do something well, you end up getting tasked with lot of other jobs that reduce the integrity of your job. The people who hold the designation of upper management are task masters without any desire to understand the details of a job or the volume of work that each employee must do. They don't believe that anyone does enough work and a complaint is seen as being weak rather than a cry for help. Most people who are hired are strong, reliable workers, but end up leaving within 2-3 years due to burn out. The company would rather hire new people than trust their senior staff with ideas and recommendations for how to improve the environment and culture. Their goals consist solely of making more money without any consideration of how to train, motivate, manage, or pay their staff to produce better or to establish defined goals and metrics in order to generate more money. When the money goals are not met, meetings take place, lots of talk about wanting to improve, but nothing that is long lasting or permanent. Everyone works for what they believe is a correct goal even though there are no goals.. The employees work out of fear and the teamwork found is making friends to help you to cover your mistakes.

I learned a lot about my potential through the fear based, micro management style of my supervisor. She put me under so much pressure, that I managed to discover ways to overcome the negative feelings that were projected in order to succeed to higher levels within my job. I was never trained for my position and developed the entire department based on my personal knowledge and experience of business. Most everything that the department currently reflects is based on my philosophy and experience. Although we have common goals within the program, goals are not presented as a team effort so my co-workers can be difficult to work with because they are sometimes operating under a different set of expectations than everyone else. To overcome this, great communication and people skills are required and utilized obtain cooperation. I have enjoyed the challenges of this unique environment as it has encouraged me to recognize and develop my own potential without much inhibition and I have been able to develop a very successful program over the years that I am proud to know that I played an important role. However, because there is no clearly defined career path, I feel limited in my ability to move up or advance within the company.

Pay was what I would expect if I was driving a local job and not an OTR job. Miles were non existent most of the time. Was fired after my accident in June of this year. I was okay with that, until it came time to get my W2s. They sent my W2s to the completely wrong address, even after I called to have my address updated after I was locked out of the system by my termination. I called to get those and my 1099. The lady told me essentially that \"since\" you dont work here anymore, you're not as important as our current driver. I said Federal law would state otherwise. I called in 2 months ago to have my address updated so I could get my W2 and 1099. The fact they couldnt do something that simple is a huge case of NOT MY PROBLEM!!! Because of their incompetence, I now can not get my tax information in a timely manner. All they have to do is sit downt down at a computer, email me a copy, it only takes a few minutes and everyone is happy. Oh no, apparently that is too much for this company to comprehend. So now I have to figure out how to get access to my information. They want me to call next week (great theory except I work 7am-5pm with an 30 minute commute there and back) So by the time I get a chance to call, they're going to be going home. NOT acceptable.

I'm usually pretty optimistic about a new work environment but the more I worked at Steven's transport the worst the environment got. I had 2 months of training three trainers got physically abused by the second trainer and was told management will take care of it. No one got back with me for all I know he is still driving with them. So I started my first month out as solo which was an awesome feeling so about the 4th week my truck broke down and that's fine stuff happens so someone in management got impatient with the shop after 4 days of me sitting there. They decide to fly me back to Dallas. So that's 90 dollars out of my my pocket that I had to pay for uber and then 30 dollars for baggage claim. So I get to dallas and guess what they tell me my truck is fixed. So now I've wasted the whole weekend not making any money and they send me back to pa. So theres another 30 dollars for baggage and another 60 for uber. Now mind you they are going to pay me for the uber but not for the baggage and oh on top of that they have to tax me for the money that I spent out of my pocket. When a multi million dollar company is reaching into their drivers pockets to pay for stuff like this it's time to move on. No amount of I'm worried will ever get me to come back to Steven's. If you take my advice go somewhere else where they will treat you like a human because Steven's doesnt. Just for the record I will be filling a complaint with the better business bureau. ProsNothing ConsHaving to pay for expenses and they tax me on my own money given back 1.0 Driver | Dallas, TX | Jun 16, 2017 They Professionalize in Black Balling Training is sufficient, but working conditions are unfair, worked for them for nine months, they don't get your home when needed, they don't pay enough and they try to make everything that happens your fault. They will tell you that so long as you work for them it's nonpreventable but the minute you quit they change it to preventable. It's done this way so that they can force you to stay with them. Lying to you the entire way telling you how great their program is. The have just as many accidents as any other company, they just pay for the to go unnoticed to protect them not you. Everything but the pay is great for two months then you find out the truth, by then they got you. Don't consider the Allience Program it's a trap, by the time they finish taking you money you are still making .30 cents per mile and some weeks less than that. Lawyers say they are at the Top among 12 Companies that Black Ball you if you try to leave them. But don't listen to me go ahead go there, you'll see for yourself, it's the worst choice a person could ever make. P.S. Ask the why over 100-300 drivers quit at one time, then ask them do they care. They don't because they have a system of bringing in over 200 hundred drivers a month hoping to keep 60 it's a perfected scam and they are good at it. MY personal opinion Take a loan out but a Truck and Trailer call TBS and drive for yourself. Good luck, I unlike most told you the truth do what you want it's your life.

Asked Aug 15, 2018 Have a few 1940's-1970's trucks for those who prefer/are more familiar/comfortable with them. This would broaden the scope of hiring more veteran/skilled drivers. If nothing else, having fully operational antiques sitting in front of the business with the company name on them would just plain look good.
