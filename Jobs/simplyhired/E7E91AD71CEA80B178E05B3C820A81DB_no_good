While artificial intelligence is being extensively explored in the electronic domain, a new possibility is emerging for passive neuromorphic computation. The approach differs from tradition optical neuromorphic computing in that no components are needed: the computation is performed entirely using passive, structured optical materials. On any given day, you will: Combine approaches for simulating light-matter interactions with machine learning to establish the fundamental properties of these novel systems, and to design novel, structured materials that will be tested experimentally Extensively exercise your background in optics, electronics, materials, theory development, and/or numerical simulations Creatively address complex problems and work, both independently and in collaboration with a diverse researching team Have opportunities to present technical results at conferences and to publish your research in high profile, peer-reviewed journals Qualifications We Require PhD degree in physics, chemistry, materials science, electrical engineering, or a closely related field Experience with theory development and/or numerical simulations and scientific programming A record of publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at scientific conferences Ability to obtain a DOE Q security clearance Qualifications We Desire Experience in optics, materials science, machine learning and/or theory development Position Information This postdoctoral position is a temporary position for up to one year, which may be renewed at Sandia's discretion up to five additional years. The PhD must have been conferred within five years prior to employment. Individuals in postdoctoral positions may bid on regular Sandia positions as internal candidates, and in some cases may be converted to regular career positions during their term if warranted by ongoing operational needs, continuing availability of funds, and satisfactory job performance. About Our Team We are the Quantum & Electronic Materials Department (08345) team! We advance the state-of-knowledge in quantum and electronic properties of materials, and collaborates closely with other domain knowledge specialists to use these advances to enable and accelerate development of emerging non-conventional computing, communication, quantum information devices, and sensors. Research efforts include: advanced materials and device concepts for ultra-low-energy computing and sensing, nano-electronics, quantum topological materials, quantum-confined low-dimensional systems, advanced materials and device concepts for neuromorphic computing, materials synthesis and device fabrication, and computational and theoretical condensed matter physics. About Sandia Sandia National Laboratories is the nation\u2019s premier science and engineering lab for national security and technology innovation, with teams of specialists focused on cutting-edge work in a broad array of areas. Some of the main reasons we love our jobs: Challenging work with amazing impact that contributes to security, peace, and freedom worldwide Extraordinary co-workers Some of the best tools, equipment, and research facilities in the world Career advancement and enrichment opportunities Flexible schedules, generous vacations, strong medical and other benefits, competitive 401k, learning opportunities, relocation assistance and amenities aimed at creating a solid work/life balance* World-changing technologies. Life-changing careers. Learn more about Sandia at: http://www.sandia.gov These benefits vary by job classification. Security Clearance Sandia is required by DOE to conduct a pre-employment drug test and background review that includes checks of personal references, credit, law enforcement records, and employment/education verifications. Applicants for employment need to be able to obtain and maintain a DOE Q-level security clearance, which requires U.S. citizenship. If you hold more than one citizenship (i.e., of the U.S. and another country), your ability to obtain a security clearance may be impacted. Applicants offered employment with Sandia are subject to a federal background investigation to meet the requirements for access to classified information or matter if the duties of the position require a DOE security clearance. Substance abuse or illegal drug use, falsification of information, criminal activity, serious misconduct or other indicators of untrustworthiness can cause a clearance to be denied or terminated by DOE, resulting in the inability to perform the duties assigned and subsequent termination of employment. EEO All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, or veteran status and any other protected class under state or federal law.
