Their approach to customer service went from give people whatever they want, to give them nothing almost overnight. Office was in BC, so there was absolutely no room to advance unless you were willing to relocate to Ontario, which was not feasible for 90% of the staff. Management was very hands off, unless there was a problem that directly put their position in jeopardy, in which their reaction would be swift and personal. Because there is no room for advancement, the burnaby office thrives on turnaround, and is constantly inventing novel ways to terminate staff to free up room for a round of new hires; regardless of whether or not the termination was warranted. You would be forced into Wireless Retention, once you reached the end of career cycle for customer service. HR is a joke, as it is with most corporations, they are glorified spies,constantly looking (and in some cases creating) for wrongdoing to be placed solely at the blame of the average staffers. In fact aside from the benefits package the only positive thing about working for Rogers, were your fellow coworkers. Prosbenefits Consstatic shifts, poor management, zero room to advance, poor corporate culture 3.0 Program Assistant | Roslindale, MA | Jan 18, 2016 Under payed/ Unappreciated/Over worked/Bad Management I worked at Rogerson Communities (Roslindale)for several years an I've expererienced a very unsupportive work environment, the management are very one-sided an often don't acknowledge the direct care staff (Program Assistants) for feedback regarding client care, the Pay is horrible for direct personal care..starting pay is 9.00 which is obsured for the job description/expectations an work environment. This company has went through staff like a revolving door.. The nursing staff change like the weather, because they are overworked an underpayed so they quit. The Program Assistants work with clients with all sorts of behavioral issues/ Health, Disability and declined cognition for 9.00/11.00 an hr. ..thats ridiculous ,Some behaviors are so extreme Program assistants are often at risk for getting attacked by clients with unpredicted behaviors. The Program environment is small ,stifling, claustrophobic.. Depressing. The only reason I lasted for several years was the clients an some ..friendly Coworkers... Overall I wouldn't recommend anyone work here...you definitely will regret it. ProsThe Wonderful Elder Clients ConsIgnorant unreasonable management, UnderPay, No Flexibilty, Overwork 4.0 Licensed Practical Nurse | Roslindale, MA | Jul 6, 2015 Working as a team was critical at Rogerson. A typical work day began with direct patient care. Clients requiring medication and or assessment prior to administering care would come in and be serviced. The day would follow with supervision and support to nursing assistants and social service staff. I learned how to cooperate and instruct as a supervisor. I learned new management skills for coordinating client's care plans according to their individual needs. Co- workers were professional and innovative in the setting. Activities and events gave clients and staff the motivation and ability for successful outcomes in health plans and daily goals set for the programs. The hardest part of the job was being a per diem employee. Missing information that may have been only available at a time I was not present or a time limit or deadline may have passed. The most enjoyable part of the job was when clients' health remained viable. With less hospitalizations and support in all areas of care,clients were then able to enjoy their daily activities giving a purpose and direction in their senior and/or challenging lives. ProsTraining and support Conshalf hour lunch, per diem schedule 5.0 Technical Support Representative | Richmond Hill, GA | Oct 15, 2019 An amazing place to work I worked at Rogers as Technical Support Agent for 2 years. Working at Rogers was one of the best companies I've ever worked for thus far. The management team was very respectful and they had an open door policy. Their goal was to make you feel comfortable at work. Everyone was friendly. The best part was getting bonuses and pay raise every 6 months, overtime was available often for the most part. There is room for growth in the company and they will help you achieve your goals within the company. I've seen people move up within the company in a short period of time. Also last but not least was the benefits I got as a part-timer. They honestly care about their employees. The con's working at Rogers as a technical support agent it was a level entry job, there was back to back calls barely any rest periods to take a breath. ProsFree lunches sometimes, a lot of overtime ConsShort breaks, fast-paced, back to back calls 1.0 Executive Assistant | Mount, NJ | Jan 3, 2014 The worst company I ever worked for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have never seen a company such as this. It seems everyone just passes responsibilities to the next person and never gets anything done. As for the Human Resources Representatives they seem to not understand their job as they keep telling you to contact their HR Hotline. Very disorganized company. The new CEO definitely needs to crack down and eliminate some lazy dead people that do not do their jobs..there is a lot at Rogers. Management is the worst that I have ever seen. They would not last on Bay street. I thought the 80's were bad with top management sleeping around..and it still exist...unbelievable. ProsNone ConsTo much to lists. 4.0 Assistant Manager | Thornhill, KY | Feb 29, 2012 For your inner \"tech geek\" Having been at Rogers for a few years, I've seen technology change in the blink of an eye! You never stop learning about new and exciting products and how they are incorporated in our everyday lives. Change is imminent in any company and over the past 3 years, I've seen some positive restructuring which I've really noticed. I believe that Rogers is heading into the right direction by maintaining its degree of competitiveness and innovation. Prosservice discounts, nation-wide discounts are various retailers Consinfo/comm. gap bet. call centres and retail stores 3.0 Operations Manager | Lakeshore, MS | Oct 16, 2015 No work life balance. Weak management. No advancement. Unfortunately, not many positive things come to mind to write. Lost my hiring manager a year into my service. The new manager not supportive at all. No advancement was on the horizon. The manager listened to hearsay and used that to manage vs. checking and looking for facts. Caused numerous issues with staff and the department. ProsGood penssion plan. Stock options and 50% discount on Rogers bill ConsFound people very resistant to change, did not want to change their ways, They were using outdated and problematic softwares. 3.0 Administrative Assistant | Roslindale, MA | Jun 24, 2017 very fun, friendly yet strenuous job answering phones, greeting clients, creating charts I have learned to be a good listener and to be attentive to the elderly community management was ok with what little she had to work with, she always tried her best was an elderly environment, lots of laughter and crying and moaning hardest part of the job was getting news about a clients death I enjoyed talking to the clients, listening to stories of there youth and present and viewing pictures and being as helpful as possible 4.0 Headend | Ontario, CA | Dec 24, 2018 Could Be Better Changes in CEO always leads to layoffs. Never sure in what direction you were going. Changes in middle managers or what team you are with always creates an adjustment period for everyone to figure it out. There are times you don't feel appreciated. People were great to work with. Only thing that counts is the bottom line $$ and shareholders. This is true for all large companies. ProsPeople, Leading Edge Technology ConsNot sure of direction at times, lack of training 5.0 Automation Engineer | United States | Jun 4, 2013 - Rogers is a leading Telecom Service Provider in Canada. Amdocs is providing End to End Business solution support including CRM, OMS, Self-care, Enabler Billing and OSS.
