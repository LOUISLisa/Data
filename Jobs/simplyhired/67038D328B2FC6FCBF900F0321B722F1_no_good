Your day to day is highly dependent upon your specific role. As a TS I found that there were ample opportunities to challenge myself internally and in customer work. There is always room to grow upward and take on more responsibility. 5.0 Safety Technician | St. Louis, MO | Jul 15, 2019 Great place Loved working there ,poor money management and job bidding causing me to be laid off. But it was a great place to work. Would go back if given the opportunity 3.0 Quality Assurance Tester | Wisconsin | Oct 29, 2019 It's Alright. Terrible advancement opportunities. If you get a job like QA, prepare to be stuck there forever. Good pay, bad everything else. Overall, gets impressionable young people to work more than they should and holds the threat of unemployment over people's heads. Also a very uninventive company. 4.0 Customer Service Representative | Jacksonville, FL | Mar 19, 2018 great employer great benefits and great company to work for with opportunities to advance. management is very nice in most areas and encouraging you to better yourself. it has a variety of people from all different cultures typical workdays vary depending on your department and the demands of the position that you are in. Prosbenefits Consdistance 4.0 Customer Service Representative | Beaverton, OR | Dec 4, 2017 Good company but motly temp jobs Good company but mostly temp jobs. Job is ended at anytime without warning and you have no idea that it is coming. No warning so you will prepare yourself. 3.0 Customer Service Representative | Temple Terrace, FL | Sep 27, 2017 pros and cons it was a great place to work but little room for advancement. the cases are hard and they harly train you they just throw you in the call. the work is easy though 5.0 Gestor/a de proyectos | Verona, WI | Oct 22, 2019 Good work environment, challenging, intelligent coworkers Good work environment, challenging, intelligent coworkers 2.0 Solutions Engineer | Verona, WI | Apr 20, 2020 Exciting work with burnout environment The work is exciting and energizing, but the company has poor leadership and transparency. There is a very high turn over rate for young employees that doesn't seem to bother anyone. 4.0 Solutions Engineer | Verona, WI | Jan 8, 2020 Cultish and not for everyone If you don't fall in love with the culture immediately, then it will be tough. This company is not for everyone but for those that fit in and work hard it will pay off. 4.0 Solutions Engineer | Verona, WI | Oct 26, 2019 Varied with a large workload Overall the job was enjoyable. The work was varied and challenging. I learned a lot of new skills. Everyday had a lot of work to be completed and I was kept very busy.
