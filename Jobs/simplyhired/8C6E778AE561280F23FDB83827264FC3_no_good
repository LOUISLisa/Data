If you're looking for job double standards, this is the workplace for you. The Constant change in policy for those on the floor will give you whiplash. If you're working in one of the Social Media accounts it is very strict in terms of what you can do. They will likely assign you to a media account that has a large quota but nothing to respond to as all the posts are negative. The workplace environment is silent. There's a stiffness. You are not allowed to use anything other than Pandora, Lunch breaks are 30 minutes while your other breaks are about 10 - 15 minutes. No writing utensils, no wandering about your desk. If you do not meet the quota (Which is evaluated every 2 weeks) You are put on probation and will be terminated if you do not reach this quota. What you can reply to is very limited. You will not reach your quota. if you are less than a second late from your breaks (Using the Bathroom, you walk slowly, etc) You will receive a warning. If you're up to three you're fired. The Management does not abide by their own policies. 1.) No food of any type is allowed at the desk. The only acceptions being Hard Candy or Gum. (If you cannot eat hard candy or gum, well that's too bad. Fruit Snacks? nope. Trail Mix for those eating healthy? Nope.) The Managers would walk in every day and each has a bag of Chipotle at their desks. Drinks with open tops are also not allowed. 2.) No writing utensils are allowed at the desks. At first, we were allowe...more ProsThe chairs were slightly comfortable ConsShort Breaks, Hostile, Manager Favoritism 4.0 Customer Service Representative | Peoria, IL | Sep 1, 2018 A decent place to work / a good place to reestablish work history There is constant changes & high turnover at HGS. The attendance policy changed for the second time since starting which gets depressing at times. I enjoy my job & am grateful that they hired me. Depends on the client you work for but wish the starting pay was hire as I am on the lower paying scale. There was a lot to learn in training & we received a long period of training. We get paid by the minute but when you use PTO for an appointment its only used in hourly increments. Holidays we are closed the only way you get paid for them is you have to work 4 -10 hour days that week & have to be on time the day after the holiday or you receive no holiday pay. Your schedules are determined by a department in India break & lunch schedules are always inconsistent. We had a food truck that we had to pay for our own meal but most everyone was late coming back from lunch due to the long line but it counted against you. A lot of pressure is put on you for certification & keeping your call times & after call numbers low but have teammates always trying to giving good advice. Only issue is you get sloppy notes or no notes on an account. Whatever client you work on there is an up sale that you are required to do on each call even if it doesn't refer to the call. If you are not a multitasker this will be a hard job. If you have to use the restroom before your breaks or lunch it counts against you unless you have a doctors note.I have awesome Team Leaders who want us to succeed & are help...more ProsOccasional Free lunches, movie nights, Postivity Wednesdays Encourging Team Leaders & Coworkers, Lockers to store your cell phone (you provide the padlock). ConsConstant changes of policies, Client expectations of staff, unneccessary upsales, inconsistent break/lunch schedules, holding your bladder until your break unless you have a doctor note, family members working on the same client, Needing to increase the time expectation for handle & wrap up times. 2.0 CIGNA COVERAGE DETERMINATION ADVOCATE | El Paso, TX | Aug 5, 2019 Entry level job if you have no bills or need money to survive Pay is sad w/little room for advancement. What advancement you can get will quickly be taken away when you're moved to a new department and have to start again at ground up. This happens because HGS over-hires since there is a large employee turnover rate. People drop like flies especially during training. This company hires like crazy but then not enough people quit as they probably anticipated (lol) so then they have to skip groups of people around from department to department every couple of months to compensate for over-hiring. This happened multiple times while I was there and I worked there less than a year... The most you can begin w/is $12 but it's not often that people start at max. Most departments start off at $10 or $11/hr during training (note: $11/hr departments have the highest call volumes and usually require Spanish fluency) which lasts several months then go up to $10.50 after training. You'll get a raise after 6 months, the max being 26 cents. You do the math, it's not great. PTO is even worse. For every 80 hours worked you get 2 hours of PTO. You can request time off 48 hours in advance but you of course won't get paid, and when you don't request time in advance you will get what is called an occurrence, and you can only have 4 every 6 months. Most of the management is nice enough but unreliable and really inconsistent. Rules and policies change every few weeks and you'll only know after you've been coached for breaking a new rule that no one told y...more 1.0 Customer Service Representative | El Paso, TX | May 22, 2019 Pros and Cons Pro You can work at home. Cons 1.No Overtime 2. They can V time you (V time means they send you home) 3.Told by the operations manager not to call the help desk do to the employee from the help desk lying to me and being rude. 4. The supervisor line is often to busy and good luck getting a hold of a tl. 5. We only have two-tier tech support employees. ( good luck waiting with out pay) 6. They lie for example you are told by Human Resources that you will get paid for the time you are out. (READ THE POLICY AS THIS IS A LIE) 7. They count on you not reading the employee manual they will pay up to a max 3 hours and anytime you spend with supervisors and making calls about the issues. 8 . Keep your own payroll log as there are mistakes. It is not my job to double check someone else and you can see your hours worked on your home pc. 9. Cover your butt recently I had tech issues I was out for 6 days I will not get paid as much as I was told by hr and it was a pain I had to prove I did not have packet loss and still the company refuses to see it. I take pictures of errors and I may also record conversations, If something is put in chat I copy it and post it in notes. Had I not covered my but I would have been fired also since we only have two tech support agents not being paid if it takes them two days to get back to you is not fair. 10. Privacy Violations my new tl stated her kid unplugged her internet. This is a violation of the company's privacy rules bu...more 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Peoria, IL | Oct 13, 2018 Former Employee I worked there for over 9 years. In that time I capped out at the max of 11.50 an hour for CSR's. You get a \"bonus\" each year after you are capped out, but it doesn't compound, so basically if you were to receive for instance a .50 cent raise at another job, then a year later you get another .50 cents that's compounding. Not HGS. If you meet all of your yearly requirements you may get 200 or 240 a year total, lets say you were lucky enough to get a 300 dollar bonus. It averages about .25 cents an hour. Unless you expect to kiss up to your team lead, 9 times out of 10 you will be stuck as a representative unless you're friends or related to someone who is in the upper management. My last account I was on, I had to train my supervisor to know how to do my job. I applied for positions to move up multiple times throughout my tenure and was always given the excuse that I didn't have enough experience. The only way to get the experience was for your bosses to let you off of the phone to do extra stuff, and if you're actually good at your job or you don't suck up to them; that won't happen. If you have a decent client, thats great, but most of the time the good clients are on the accounts that the callers just suck. If you have a decent account where the caller's aren't jerks, then typically the clients are unrealistic. If you do luck out and get promoted, depending on the account, the clients can take your job away overnight. There is an account where if the client doesn't like you...more ProsGreat health/vision/dental benefits, paid vacation, half hour lunch, 15 minute breaks Consunrealistic expectations, unable to advance, callers rude, expendable; no job security. 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Remote | Feb 16, 2020 Save Yourself Looking to be surrounded by pretentious management with \u2018beat around the bush\u2019 tactics? Does Holier Than Thou Upper Hand direction get you where you need to be in your career life? If complete lack of security, an environment in which places YOU (yeah, you rockstar) in the middle of what you could only assume is a poor season of the Young and the Restless, and unreliability in those whom occupy the leadership rolls surrounding you, motivate you in a positive manner in which allows you to adapt and grow as an employee? Do you thrive off empty promises and find opportunity in empty promises? HGS should be RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY, then! This was not a seasonal job and I was to have a position at HGS whether the client remained the same or if transitions had to be experienced - the job security was a promise the moment I stepped into my role as an employee at HGS. A year later, being told the client was disbanding its contract with HGS, my team and I were also told to HAVE NO FEAR for there were a total of 130 of us and 120 jobs to be filled- to make a long story short, a WOPPING 50% of the team was kept, not to mention there was A DEADLINE in which we were ensured we\u2019d be keeping our positions until (while being placed elsewhere in the company of course) in which abruptly was no longer in the picture and waves of lay-offs began.

They say it\u2019s because it\u2019s an Indian based company $9.15 per hour Low to no raises. Lucky to work 40 hours a week since you\u2019re being outsourced to Mexico. Slow computers Slow in updating information which will get you fired Always late on bonus and paychecks They change your schedule so you maybe late and it\u2019s your fault They call it coaching however when you\u2019re fired it\u2019s a write-up and decline your unemployment They lie that you was written up twice however you\u2019ve been written up once that you know Coaching / Write-up you can\u2019t put in your rebuttal They can only write you up, you can\u2019t write them up They\u2019ve admitted to cut the hours to where you can\u2019t function financially and have to look elsewhere to avoid unemployment. Irate customer automatically your fault If someone had a dog with flees they bring them in, they don\u2019t send them home or do anything about the fleas. Seriously not joking Chairs that you sit in are always broken. They claim they take them out of commission however they just move them to the other side of the building High turnover rate and high firing. Example 90% of your class will leave quickly. 8 Managers in a year have been fired First you're a free member of ZIPCAR then once you're fired they cancel your membership I'm just going to stop from here.

A typical day at work consists of \"hopefully\" logging into your computer, taking lots of calls, and maybe getting to leave on time. I have learned lots of information on electronics; despite not having the proper training from the start, I've had to learn most of the things I know by myself. Management is completely terrible. If you need help while being on a call they aren't ever around most of the time. Most of the Team leaders and management are always involved in some kind of drama. The workplace is full of not so nice people. There are quite a few people on drugs. It's hard to avoid some rude people there but that's going to be any job, really. I do have to give HGS an award for having disabled people that some other jobs wouldn't even think to hire. The hardest part about my job is when we have a bunch of calls holding and they come back to back and you don't have enough time to make sure you have the previous callers notes and account in order. When you try to put yourself in an \"unavailable\" mode, even for just a minute, to just try to get caught up on your accounts and notes, you will not get paid. The most enjoyable part of my job is when they do random giveaways or bring in free lunches. There isn't really much else to say about this job. It has its moments but don't expect too much. If you are in need of employment, they are probably going to be the easiest/best place to try. 1.0 Product Specialist | Waterloo, IA | Feb 15, 2017 Only recommend if you're desperate This was a terrible job. Pay was low, we had to upsell unnecessary products to customers, management left a lot to be desired. My coworkers were great. It was also easy to get hired which was a pro. Typical Day: Log in, answer calls all day. A lot of customers called in upset and there wasn't much we could do to resolve situations due to company policies. There was a break room for lunch that had sandwiches, drinks, snacks and salads. Occasionally we were rewarded for meeting metrics by earning gift cards for the snack area. Dress was casual. Pay was abysmal. There was an incentive pay of $1.00 extra an hour if you were not absent/late each week but pay was still at $9.50/hr for reps and once you moved up , there was only an extra dollar/hr. Benefits were awful. We used to get pizza for working on Saturdays but the company stopped that. Most enjoyable part of the job: coworkers, actually being able to resolve customer issues. Management was chaotic. They didn't want to be working there either. Our location seemed to be headed in the direction of closing when our lease was up.Jobs did not feel secure, there were people let go frequently. Honestly, I'd recommend applying to Grainger instead. ProsCoworkers ConsPay, healthcare, having to upsell instead of fix problems, not stable-hours were cut a lot. 4.0 Trainer | Peoria, IL | Sep 20, 2018 Why I love my job I have worked at HGS for almost 6 years, in that time frame I have went from a CSR to a Trainer. I've been very lucky learn from a leadership staff who has guided me along the way and built me up so that I can keep growing with in the company. I like coming to work to see what challenges I can overcome each day and the personal growth I have seen within myself has been very rewarding. Is the job the easiest? No not by a long shot, however I have learned to tackle each obstacle and grow from it. Each day I learn something new about myself and those who work around me. I represent a great client who cares about the representatives that support their brand. I look forward to my future at HGS. The pay is not the best especially when some fast food locations pay the same thing starting out. Vacation time is up to you to earn and I'm proud that I'm in control of how much vacation time I earn so I feel blessed to know if I need two weeks off in a year for some occasion I can make that my goal to make sure I earn that time off. Another great feature with this company is you may start one account and after 6 months if you feel that account is not for you, you can apply at other accounts. That is how I found the account that was for me.
