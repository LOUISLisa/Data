I have nothing good to say other than I'm glad I don't work here anymore. They pay was bad, no insurance, the managers only put bandaids on issues...no WFM skills or anything. The corporate office was based in India so it was very hard to get real-time answers after lunch.. ProsNothing ConsEverything 3.0 Software Architect | New Jersey | Feb 20, 2020 Experience in Hexaware 1) Learnt to deal various client across the globe parallel. 2) Gained more knowledge on various stock exchanges and it's policies. 3) But there is no support from Hexaware managemet and HR. For every thing we have to follow up several times and it ends with not a fruitful answers. 4.0 Customer Service Representative | Jamesburg, NJ | Jan 12, 2015 A fun place to work with especially the associates. Answering phone calls, reviewing patient accounts, obtain and update patient information, sending out claims to insurances, and follow up are just a few daily tasks. I learned that in customer service department you should be more than willing to assist customers the best way possible and be empathetic towards them and their concerns. The management is good. They are very understanding with your situation. The coworkers are fun to work with, and you can definitely build friendships with them outside of work. I personally think that the hardest part of the job is when the patients refuse to pay their part of the bill after their insurance/s have paid their portion because writing off their account balance is not always applicable. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that we all can pause and acknowledge each other and celebrate any occasions such as birthdays and holidays. 2.0 Delivery Manager | Alpharetta, GA | Jan 4, 2017 A very \"ok\" place to work at! A very \"ok\" place to work at! The upper management is poor. The work-life balance is just ok. There is no visibility/help/mentorship provided if and when you are coming to the end of your current project billing. 4.0 Program Manager | United States | Nov 29, 2014 Hexaware Technologies My experience with Hexaware was nothing but positive. Hexaware is an Indian based company, that provides IT support for various corporations in the US, so most projects are done with the assistance of the onshore and offshore teams. They offer excellent training for those looking to become certified. Their IT technical team is amazing, once you get comfortable with the accents, as communication can sometimes be a challenge. Overall a great company to work for, I would definitely recommend them. ProsTraining 3.0 Assistant Vice President | Chicago, IL | Mar 6, 2020 Typical Medium size Company Company culture is employee friendly and supports work life balance in most of the cases. Company needs to mature to grow to expand. Internal policies and mindset of existing people need to change to be able to grow the company. 2.0 Technical Project Manager | Alpharetta, GA | Jan 17, 2020 Its a ok company to start your career if you are focused on what you want to achieve - Freedom to plan and work given - no one will appreciate your good work - you can see someone appreciated for your work - personal life will be with company only 3.0 Systems Analyst | McLean, VA | Nov 9, 2016 Typical Consulting company Was working in a client location. Did not have much experience interacting with the other people working with the company, except for my team mates. Treated well. 5.0 Tester/a | Atlanta, GA | Aug 20, 2018 Ambiente de trabajo retador. Es una empresa que busca siempre la mejora continua y busca siempre satisfacer las necesidades de sus clientes. Busca retribuir el esfuerzo de sus trabajadores de una manera justa. ProsSeguro mÃ©dico privado, prestaciones superiores a las de la ley.
