They have encouraged me to do my better job with better results. I feel happy whenever I go to work because I have more freedom than I have ever expected. 4.0 Ejecutivo/a de atenciÃ³n a clientes | Delaware | Jan 25, 2020 Buen ambiente laboral Te dan la oportunidad de tener linea de carrera de acuerdo al mercado. 4.0 Operations Supervisor | San Fernando, CA | Sep 22, 2019 Typical day at work The work day wasnt bad, dealing with customers are sort of stressful sometimes because to them they're always right but in honesty they aren't. We organize and serve but if they dont like the service that we provide then it's my duty that they do and serve them so well that they'll come back another time 3.0 Coordinator | Ontario, CA | Dec 15, 2016 Friendly and challenging workplace. In April 2017 it will be my 3 years with cineplex, within those years I have become an asset to the company and have been promoted to Teller, Team Leader, and Birthday Party Coordinator. A typical day at work for me includes interacting with guests, calling and emailing guests about the birthday party program, booking and confirming parties, balancing the safe, depositing money, and being apart of the management team. I learned how to become more outgoing, how to communicate, and I learned to be more patient and considerate. My management team is amazing and I have become extremely close with them. My coworkers are like family to me and I enjoy working with them on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job would be ensuring the birthday party program runs smoothly, and working alongside the management team to ensure this. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my friends and being able to be a team. ProsFree movies, tuition bursary, understanding/flexible schedule. ConsNo Tuesday off. 5.0 Assistant Manager | Sherwood Park, CA | Jan 16, 2020 Fun Place to Work If you enjoy movies and dealing with people then this is the place for you. I you require schedule flexibility then this is the place for you. No you do not make a lot of money working but if you need walking around money then this is the place. 5.0 Assistant Manager | Chicago, IL | Feb 18, 2018 Productive and very fun loving. I like the fast paced hotel and being able to interact with all types of people. The hardest part of the job making sure that everyone get to see their movie on time. The most enjoyable part is watching all of the movies. ProsFree movies Consit's open 365 of the year. 3.0 Crew Supervisor | Chicago, IL | Jan 19, 2017 movies a lot of clean theaters great concession stand very expensive though. nice seating good surround sound .kid friendly I really love this theatre cool place 5.0 Host/Hostess | Markham, IL | Oct 18, 2017 Fun workplace overall great experience and environment to be in. you get to interact with many people in a public environment. The management was second to none, they were always there for support. Prosdiscount on lunches Consshort breaks 1.0 Route Driver | Orlando, FL | Oct 14, 2017 Lots of work very little pay Worked for Orlando area and had me working long hours driving long distances in the most dangerous highways with a van which had 380000 miles and was breaking apart . If you have kids say goodbye to family time or daycare because when I asked for a raise they said I would have to wait for the yearly bonus if I did good. Have people working against you in the parts department when trying to get a part fixed they get you in trouble instead of helping like a team. Co workers will sabotage your locations by taking working parts and replacing them with parts from their location which need service in order to have good clean weekends without service calls on their locations and passing work to you. Security cameras only in certain locations making it unsafe to do any sort of collecting. They tell their employees to express themselves how ever they want and that they are open to your thoughts but use it against you if productivity does not go their way.
