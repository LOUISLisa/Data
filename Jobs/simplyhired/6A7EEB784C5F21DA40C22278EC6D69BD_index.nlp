Overall Reviews at Red Bull 2.0 Account Manager | Huntington Beach, CA | Nov 25, 2014 If you work here be prepared for lies by upper management I've been working here for over 2 1/2 years now and have seen this place go from being the greatest job to being the absolute worse I've ever had and it's all because of management. Typical day here is being to work by 5am, and don't be late cause you can be written up if you are. Then count our trucks that are almost always wrong and then have a group meeting to discuss weekly news. After that we go into the field and are supposed to get 20 stops done per day which is almost near impossible to do and still give each one the proper service they need. Then around 3 or 330 you head back in and then by about 4 you should be on your way home. All of this doesn't sound all that bad until you get into it and you see how bad management is. There's only one DM here that actually knows what he's doing, we have one DM that has no beverage experience at all (obviously knows how to interview), one open DM spot that should be filled and then our branch manager is best friends with his boss. What's bad about that is, he's never done our job, he thinks he has but covering a week or a few days doesn't mean he knows what we go thru on a daily basis for months at a time, day in day out.....but he'll swear he's the best. Little man's complex I think cause he's really short. Redbull just came out with this new focus on wanting to promote within, which would be great...but it's a lie. There's been DM position open for 3 month's and you mean to tell me that nobody at Redbull is qualified t...more ProsBenefits ConsPoor Management, long hours, little pay, no life outside of work 5.0 Sales Representative | Arkansas | Mar 6, 2019 Interactive and flexible job with lots of learning opportunities Working at Red bull gave me the opportunity to test my professional skills and people skills. During a shift or, \"mission,\" two of us would go to white-collar businesses in Northwest Arkansas and offer a complimentary sample of red bull. \"Usually our biggest competitor is Monster but in the workplace it's coffee.\" With a solid amount of vendors doing business in Bentonville and Rogers, we had a large amount of people to win over with out product. We would do so by providing information about our product's contents and comparing ingredients with other sources of energy and caffeine. We would track consumption patterns to report mack to our manager by asking questions like \"how often do you drink Red Bull?\" Or if they say they don't like it we would just simply ask \"why?\" Our schedule was also extremely flexible. We would get \"mission assignments\" every two weeks and from the comfort of our own home we would strategically plan locations to visit in the area. A mission is usually 4-6 hours long. We also got to go on our calendar in the portal and mark our unavailability so when our supervisor (based in Memphis) went to assign each of us to certain shifts, if we are unable to work your name will not come up as an option to cover that shift. The hardest part of the job was the 7AM shifts. Our office is based in Springdale, so about 20 minutes from where I lived. So I would have to wake up at 5 am to shower, blow dry my hair, and put on makeup. Our appearance for the job was su...more Prosfree Red Bull, flexible hours, smiling faces, opportunity to travel, opportunity to grow Conshard to take up all of the time during a shift 2.0 Warehouse Manager | Zelienople, PA | Aug 4, 2015 Great people to work with but extremely poor leadership at Branch and Regional level. Being a Warehouse Manager has it's ups and downs. The Up would be getting to be around a lot of likable employees such as your part-time loaders, account sales managers, district sales managers, operations manager, and third party contractors. Building working relationships that makes dealing with the stresses of the job more tolerable. The Downside is many. Workload is tremendous and you have little support or manpower to help you out. The regional level and branch level managers know you have no help and their OUTSTANDING leadership, haha, shows in their ability to not help you out when you're loading 20 trucks every day by hand by an estimated 4,500 cases of Red Bull a day. Not to mention you're in charge of inventory management. You're in charge of ensuring that all DOT documents are sent in weekly for every truck and driver within your FLEET. By yourself, you have to make time to keep your entire warehouse clean on top of ensuring your three tier racks are organized in some type of fashion. With everything that I have mentioned, all damage cases have to be rebuilt into sell-able cases. Another duty you have as a warehouse manager, drive and set-up bulk deliveries to all major bulk store outlets, ie Sam's Clubs. So all in all, the up is just being around likable employees. The down is horrible pay for the amount of work you do. Not to mention having horrible leadership at the branch and regional level. Did I mention office politics and favoritism at the ...more ProsEnjoying employees social atmosphere ConsTremendous workload, severely understaffed, and extremely poor leadership. 1.0 Account Manager | Huntington Beach, CA | Dec 4, 2013 Red Bull Distrobution Company was worse company I ever worked for. You average start your day at 430am, Managers speak down to you in your daily meetings, start your route for the day, constant harassment about hitting your number through phone calls and texts, Have to work through difficult customers and a route that has to many store for their time restraints they limit you to, 10 hours for the day maximum even though it takes 12 hours to finish your route (traffic customers, etc), come back to the warehouse to do inventory of your truck, then turn paperwork, to get more harassment about your area/sales for the day. Hard work goes unnoticed by everyone in management. Get no help when needed by anyone, get about a max of a two day crash course of on the job training ( it used to be a week+) and they belittle you when you mess up due your lack of training given. The management team are so unorganized and unprofessional that it almost to the point of humorous. District Manages are puppets and will not stick up for you ever. Favoritism runs rampant with management. The only thing bare able are your coworkers that are going through the same conditions as you are experiencing. Moral is almost nonexistent. They changed the pay rates so much that it went from between $15 to $8 dollars for the years that I have worked there and 4+ reroutes to smaller areas with the same over blown numbers so you can never make your goals for the month. Every time they change it they indicate its a better for you, which its not.

Redbull Distribution Company is NOT RedBull North America Look people, it's simple. RedBull North America seems like a pretty cool place to work. redbull distribution company is not the same thing. Otherwise known as RBDC, this is by far, the worst company in North America to work for. You are a slave. 5 am to whenever late evening hour you get to go home, horrible, fake, and backstabbing managers, no direction from incompetent upper management. They will lie and create this atmosphere of \"fun\" until you get on board. Then, you will remember reading this and realize you've been duped. I know saying this is the worst company to work for is a bold statement but I promise you, it's true. If you have a family that you never want to see, work minimum 13 hour days, be treated like a slave who can't do anything right and use your weekends to rest and be tired to do anything else, this is the place for you! People get fired daily, there is no job security unless you are a suck up and a company man. If not, your days are numbered. Most of the other ASM's here cant get jobs anywhere else which is why they get hired here. Trucks always break down and you will get the blame for that as well. Stores are always being added and you are to add them to an already crazy unmanageable route. Good luck getting replacment uniforms or merchandisers for your large stores.you are the salesman, driver, and merchandiser for all of your stores. You will get empty promises, lies, and a good amount of double talk to keep you conned but your 13-17 hour days w...more ProsPros? Uh, let's see.....NONE! Conspretty much everything, not kidding, everything 3.0 Field Marketer | Portland, OR | Feb 28, 2017 Highly ambitious company with unbalanced expectations Within this organization, there are so many different avenues to continue to progress within, and they look to hire from within extensively. The vast areas the brand is involved is allows employees to understand the full picture of the brand, and how everyone relies on one another to achieve the brands singular goal. The health & wellness benefits are fantastic. The employees all have a drive to be better, both themselves & others in and outside the organization. Beyond the benefit of experience & passion to be better, Red Bull has disgusting expectations of it's employees put work ahead of anything else, even personal time. The importance of \"work\" is the only standard that management expect from it's employees here. There's no room to question or shed light on the unbalance of work & personal life. If done, there's usually an unseen target placed on you to coach you up or out. The lack of respect for the value that employees place on personal time is can be seen at all levels of management. In addition, this organization doesn't allow you to directly oppose management & certain directions, even if it's best for the employee. Overall, if you plan on being employed at a place that doesn't respect you or your thoughts, personal time, or fair opinions, this is the place to be. ProsVast experience networking with many groups & individuals, Ability to attend events is huge plus, Health benefits are incredible ConsUnrealistic expectations of work/life balance, Not accepting of others with contrasting viewpoints or opinions, Still very corporate environment, even though the \"brand\" exemplifies something else 1.0 District Sales Manager | Harrisburg, PA | Jul 11, 2014 If you want to LIVE AT WORK you found the RIGHT PLACE, With little I have been the DSD business for 18 years, this was the worst place I have ever worked. The hours are crazy long easy 65 plus that's 1 reason I left the company. There is no real work life balance starting at 4:45 am and finishing your day leaving the warehouse after 6:00 pm note the other reason I left the company. The communication from above in my option is lacking, they know the hours employees are working yet do nothing to correct the problem. Your employees need to be a company's #1 priority across the board from safety, account load, work life balance, I do not feel this was a top priority at Red Bull. The reps are paid penny's for the work load they have. The average rep was making around $42,000 a year if they hit all there objectives, key word is IF they hit all there objectives. They do send the top reps to nice Red Bull events but again you need to be the cream of the crop and that's how it should be. The product is second to none in the market and does sell very well for being so high priced. A normal day is 18-24 plus accounts give or take on the day. I made the wrong decision going to Red Bull, not saying its like this across the country but I would not make the same decision again knowing what I know now. I made the choice to go to red bull well because its Red bull, thinking it would be a cool place to work _ GOD I WAS WRONG. What I can tell you in closing is this, if you want to work long hours for penny's apply. The positive is you will have jo...more ProsNone that i could find ConsVery long hours, little pay, poor go to market plan, no work life balance 5.0 Graduate Program | Santa Monica, CA | Jan 14, 2014 All work, all fun, all the time You will probably never find a place more fun than Red Bull to work. That being said, you will probably work 7 days a week for proportionally low pay. The opportunities to contribute are endless as it truly is an entrepreneurial environment -- pitch your best idea for business planning and if it's good, it very well may happen. There is a certain degree of nepotism in advancing up the chain and while young employees have a lot of responsibility and are eager to learn, the opportunities to move from entry level to manager require massive leaps & bounds -- there is little room for advancement without many years dedicated here. Moreover, most managers are too busy or not interested in developing their direct reports. There is a severe lack of guided learning and mentorship -- everything is learn by sink of swim, for better or for worse. Massive changes over the past year have sparked tensions with new org structure and processes -- good for the long run, bummer in the short run for some of the company. For a newcomer, there is an obvious nostalgic tension between \"the way things were\" (when there was more cash) and the current state of affairs. ProsAmazing workplace culture, perks, work friends are also real life friends, perks, opportunity to work on the coolest projects in the world ConsLow pay for the hours and dedication given, shaky upper management, growing pains of a global brand grasping on to grassroots, managers always too busy to develop young employees 4.0 Account Manager | Neenah, WI | Mar 5, 2019 Fun, fast-paced environment to work I have enjoyed my time at Red Bull! A typical day for me involves a morning meeting with the team to go over programs and sales objectives deemed important towards our bottom line, counting and then distributing product to a routed client base, and using sales techniques to convince customers to give Red Bull a larger presence in-store. Management at all levels go out of their way to help you, or point you in the right direction of help. It was a shock to see higher-ups at the company coming out into the field with our reps, but they make it a point! This contributes to an overall stellar workplace culture. The hardest part of the job by far is dealing with rejection. As with any sales job, you will hear no far more often than yes at first. Being able to deal with that and work through it is a must. Also, if physical labor is not your thing, look elsewhere. Although not grueling by any means, there is a lot of moving around on the job. You will be driving, walking, and pushing and pulling product despite the weather. On the flipside, the most enojoyable part of this job is finally hearing a customer say yes to a sales pitch. Also, the benefits are top notch. I will say that the pay fluctuates due to the ever changing landscape of sale which can suck, but if you hit your goals you can make a decent amount per year. Overall, this is a good place to look if you are looking for an entry level sales position with a reputable company. 4.0 Loader | Manteca, CA | Apr 4, 2014 Great place to learn and progress, fun, safe and tons of energy!! Say my hello's, clock in and get to organizing, cleaning, counting inventory, recording batch numbers checking for safety issues, preparing to load product onto trucks, using forklift, loading and unloading, lifting 25 to 50+, setting up displays for merchandising and sales managers. I learned how to attack and resolve difficult or unusual tasks, operate a forklift safely and at a good pace, learned to communicate issues or concerns thoroughly. What it takes to step up when management is not around and executive decisions must be made. Management and co-workers are a must when it comes to communication and working together, makes for a stronger and on the same page team. We built good professional relations with each other so we could understand what we're all there for, to work and succeed the company and ourselves. The most difficult part of the job would have to be the cramped amount of space to work in (often like playing tetris due to the number of vehicles and small parking space, and tight areas to operate a forklift in). I enjoy the fact that I get to learn new things and take on tasks above my title that prove challenging, but rewarding when completed. The energy support and the team trips or gifts are awesome.
