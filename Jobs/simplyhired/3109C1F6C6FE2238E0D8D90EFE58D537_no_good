Solutions 1.0 Associate | Youngstown, OH | Nov 1, 2015 Pay close attention to this employer When I was called back for an interview, I was truly happy. I've heard good things about the opportunities of putting more money into your wallet. If you are coming from a minimum wage job, it is definitely a step up. However, after evaluating my experience, one should question if it is truly worth it to leave their former job. Upon my interview ending, I was hired in for sales to start a training. I then learned how inconsistent and unorganized the place can be: Red flags: 1. I received a call the Friday before training that I will be moved to a different schedule last minute. 2. Once in the training, EVERYONE found that they were being moved to a department other than sales and would now be training for sales support. 3. In nesting, our trainer was overworked and his SME had to take over and half of our pay was almost messed up. 1. After becoming employed I found that often times: 2. Bonuses promised may not be given, 3. the bonus structure is VERY inconsistent, pay checks are often shortened or they fail to tax you at the proper time and the next check has lots more taken out 4. the only raise is a promotion - IF YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH SOMEONE IN MANAGEMENT. There's a woman who has been with the company 2-3 years, always watches teams without being paid that amount. EVERY TIME, EVERY interview, she is looked over. 5. Many individuals in management have had relations with their employees. 6. Ma...more Prosbonuses, 40 hour work week, pot lucks, contests Consbonus structure changes, un-fulfilled promises of bonuses or contest payouts, unorganized company 2.0 Accounts Assistant | Los Angeles, CA | Oct 23, 2019 Good Company but not Good Clients I have been working at VXI for almost one year and I love the company, but don't like their clients. Calls come in very fast, but when they have a client the calls are suddenly slow. Not enough break times to release the stress we have to deal with. People that are qualified for this job are being let go, but others that don't even have the qualification to move up get promoted. There is only one very rude supervisor that is working here. This supervisor does not help the agents, but would sometimes scream at them for the usage of the supervisor's power. If you need to report any incident at work the HR department does nothing to protect its employees. There are many times that fights would happen because some workers treat the office like a jungle. It's not high school. but a workplace. Other agents would even come to work late, but managed to get away with it because management seems to not care about what's happening. Our set of equipment such as earphones is uncomfortable to use which sometimes hurts our ear or our customers cannot hear us. Their computer system would sometimes have a system error that takes a long time to fix. There are too many supervisors' meetings. Everyday supervisors go on a meeting and agents have no one around to ask for help. If a supervisor is on their desk, some supervisors will not help the agent. The workplace has no policy for bringing inside food or cellphone but others break the rules. Overtime is provided, but sometimes the compan...more ProsSome employees are friendly, sometimes we have free lunch ConsShort Breaks, Unclean Office, and Not Enough Overtime 1.0 Manager | Atlanta, GA | Sep 2, 2019 former employee happy to be out This is by far the worst company I have been apart of!!! I have over 15 years experience with call center positions and this company takes the cake. I was in management myself so no need to lie about this review. Where do I start the organization as a whole doesn't care about the employees. We would have focus group meetings to find ways to get the employees to stay everything except the obvious pay more money. The only kick back they will receive is free pizza and wings which is fine if you are a 8 year old child but no so much being an adult. The site director will come in and make promises of bonuses and pay outs if the training class makes it 60-90 days but that's a lie very used car salesman approach. Ask any graduating class if they had received their bonus if you don't believe me. Overall ghetto place I would never go back there funny thing per the department of labor they still have me working there even though I resigned months ago ( but I will file that complaint with the DOL) because VXI is doing what we call baking the books they will halt all resignations and firing so that when reported to share holders it doesn't look as if they are losing as much people as they are. All in all the worse company I have ever worked for management shows favoritism and is very messy. All the good supervisors left as for trainers they show no value to their people. Do yourself a favor don't apply I get it if you need quick income for a few weeks that's okay but please look for w...more Prosits on the southside Consbox is to small to lost them all Pay schedule Culture enviroment all of the above 1.0 Accounts Assistant | College Park, GA | Jun 12, 2020 The worst I've been a part of. Management at the College Park, Georgia office doesn't value employee opinions to make the job better. The company is not transparent with hours to work per week. Although the employee handbook states full time employees work 40 hours per week, employees do not (you will not receive an employee handbook. You will receive a page about conduct during training). Hourly employees are told to login to set up for incoming calls, but not before you login to get paid. You can be in attendance from 7:00 am - 5:45 pm and get paid for less than 10 hours. The company makes sure you do not get 40 hours per week, therefore, no overtime pay. This is the only company i have worked for that doesn't allow you to see your daily in/out punches on your own. Your supervisor has to show you but will not printout for you. You are not told during training that the company doesn't pay you for breaks. If you want to use the restroom, you must log out, where you are not paid and log back in upon returning (Management will log you out if you don't). During training you are told the premise of the job is to take incoming calls for one state. Several states are added, but pay is not increased. Management is concerned about employees receiving high quality calls to make them look good. Incentives are spoken of during training but it's a joke. During Covid-19 pandemic, employees are not 6 ft apart. There is not daily cleaning of surfaces or office space. Weekly hiring is taking place, but ...more ProsYou have a job. ConsThe company is not transparent and answers from management appear to be scripted. 1.0 Sales Representative | Los Angeles, CA | Mar 3, 2015 I had no idea it would be this bad. There are no benefits to staying any length of time. There are no raises or cost of living increases. When the minimum wage was raised, nothing changed. There are no paid vacations or holidays. It is a highly stressful environment, where even the best most experienced people can be sent home early for not meeting minimum sales requirements. This happens with alarming regularity, due to unsellable calls being counted against you. The job consists of taking incoming calls supposedly to set up Directv. Many of the calls are actually transfers to other departments or \"ghost\" calls (dead air). If you get too many of these, you will be sent home early. You will also be required to make up the missed time on your day off. And, you can be sent home early while you're making up time as well. I have not had an 80 hour paycheck in the 8 months I have been there. You can't use the restroom without permission. You never know when your breaks will be so you can't plan anything. The training staff is absolutely substandard, but this is the only venue where that can be mentioned. The supervisors all say that the trainers told you the wrong thing. Everyone seems to know different protocol and there have been many occasions when my supervisor told me to do something that Quality Assurance had told me was a serious enough violation to cost me a $50 fine on my paycheck. When I explained that this was a violation, my supervisor was surprised. One of the saddest and most surprising things, was tha...more Prosnone Constoo many, see my review 1.0 Account Manager | Forest Park, OH | Oct 20, 2018 Save your time and look elsewhere. More Cons Than Pros Unfortunately. Pros % You might get lucky and find one or a few people you get along with. % It's a job. Some money is better than no money. % There's a base pay, to try and make up for the challenges in earning commission. % While employed over a month, you get eligible for \"free\" TV (top-tier) TV coverage for 4 TV's. % Semi-Affordable Dental and Vision Care. Cons % Hard to earn commissions/\"spiffs\". Only about 5%-10% of employees consistently earn commissions. % Base pay is too low. % Upper Management communication needs a lot of work. % Company is disorganized % Hard to reach anybody in HR % Perhaps out of desperation, they knowingly hire people who have histories of sexual harassment and aggressive behavior. % Employee Benefit of \"free TV\" is very hard to take advantage of and you won't get any % Healthcare plan is unaffordable. % Software rigged to send the good customers/leads to \"favorite\" employees, and others to the rest of the group.

Is VXI A REAL COMPANY OR A SLAVE SHIP? Verizon Upsell It is the Red-haired Stepchild. Where should we start with Upsell. First Benefits are a Joke. At $10 Per hour you can hardly afford lunch. Vacation should we have to ask permission? Do not get a cold, notify your doctor in advance that you are sick so that he/she is on call. Do not have a car? Hope public transport is on time. Let us deal will advancement opportunities, they do not exist. Go to the bathroom do not let it be more than a total of 17 minutes during the work day and do not take more than ten minutes for your break--you are written up for any over due time for breaks or lunch. And please do not speak to co-workers during the day you have to be on the phones making at least a minimum of 8-10 sales per day no matter the quality of incoming contacts. While you may get high scores for quality calls=100% this does not count toward continued employment. Flexible work-time. If the budget is in distress your hours will be reduced--\"Green Time\". Let us deal with coaching vs. \"This is not what you did well but did you use any \"REBUTTLE \" no matter the call situation. Do they not know about the classic Sales Management and Coaching process founded by a higher Fortune 500 organization. There are times when a person in west no-where East Coast New England will not buy and are angry with their Verizon bill, network performance, lied to by Direct TV, or Customer Service. As an Upsell agent you deal with this without any power to help the customer. So no sell =p...more Conscompensations, sales commission is a joke. benefits are more of a joke. 1.0 Outbound Sales Representative | Youngstown, OH | Nov 17, 2018 Horrible place to work This is the worst job I've had. Training wasn't bad until we hit the floor after nesting. They are pretty hard on you about making sales. Was told in training that as long as we put in effort, we would get our 40hrs and not get sent home due to lack of sales. Not true at all. If you call in sick, they still try to con you into coming into work, just to see if you're really sick, make you take like 2 calls, and send you home. If you have a medical problem and need a day off then you are required to make up those hours that very week or risk getting written up or fired. Find somebody dead in you're house? You still better be at work or make that time up. No sympathy for employees. They don't care about stressing out their employees. They hound you about sales and walk they bay like a prison warden. They encourage you to sell something to customers who are already having problem with their current package. But they dont want to buy from a company that added stuff to their bill without consent but that is the employee's fault for not getting that sale. They always play the same music everyday. It's annoying and horrible music. It is played so loud, I had my phone turned up all the way and couldn't hear the customers. Then the team leaders like to be loud and yell right next to you while you're in a call and a customer doesnt appreciate that, it costs you the sale, and your team leader acts like it was your fault. They give holidays off, but you still have to come in Saturday and ...more ProsLunch breaks, location, should be easy job, you sit in a chair and talk on a phone all day, free parking ConsBad professionalism, company ethics, people sell drugs outside the front door 1.0 Agent | Canton, OH | Sep 17, 2016 Husk of an actual company It's ok as long as you don't want an actual job. Everything is absolutely dis-organized, no one knows what's going on, corrupt management, even worse middle management, incompetent HR, this list goes on. If you feel the need to work here, stay away from everything and everyone, they boast teamwork and integrity, but it's actually favoritism, groups and cliques that it's run on. So many people quit because they realize it's a joke. A typical day for me is going to work, answering phones and having to find at least one competent person to ask questions to. I've stayed under the radar. They fire so often that's it's almost moot to get to know anyone. I learned how not to run a business, how to deal with people in higher positions with little to no knowledge of their actual job, how to identify and avoid bad management practices, how to not bring myself any attention. Management on all levels is a joke, I haven't had much interaction with the building director, but I imagine that if he let's this get away at the entry level management level he can't be good at his job either. The other agents are mostly fine, they are the reason most people stay is because they've made friends with each other, there is little incentive to keep this job outside of that. The hardest part, knowing you work for a place that does not recognize their decent employees, watching good ones leave because of treatment and bullying tatics employed by management. Knowing that your paychec...more ProsOther agents Conspay, management, hr, parking, everything 1.0 Sales Representative | Canton, OH | Jan 31, 2013 Poor Place to Work, Beggars outside the building At first I thought I landed a great job! I only worked here for 3 months and every day got worse and worse. The human resource hiring lady tricked me into taking a job in Direct TV. It looked nice, but I hated this job in Direct TV because the training sucked and yelling in the training room like we were a bunch of animals. He also cussed at us like we were a bunch of losers for not knowing how to work computers fast enough. I couldn't believe they let him say those cuss words to us as a group. Don't be tricked by the nice managers. If they don't like you as a person, you are not going to last. They will make sure their computers do not give you enough quality calls because they will want you to quit. Half the calls were from people complaining about advertisements or people calling for just general information but they don't want to buy it. I could not sell them and so I get written up and affects my quota! Half the time people have no money to buy direct TV and I get written up for poor sales and don't meet quota and don't get commission bonus. It was a nightmare. Management never cares about anybody there. Their computers are so slow and they have no money to fix them. The computers are a joke for a company this size. If you like slow, ancient computers and managers yelling at you about their slow computers, then this is the job for you. The sidewalk in front of building has lots of litter and trash everywhere like a dump. Most people in the building dress like poor people...more Prosnice warm place to work.
