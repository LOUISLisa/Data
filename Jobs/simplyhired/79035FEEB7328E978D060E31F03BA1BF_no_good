an offering of $12.25 per hour back in 2013 I thought to my self \"Wow this is a great company, with great pay!\" boy was I wrong. As my time at PayPal progressed I started realizing a lot of what I was turning a blind eye to before. I was hired to be in the \"general\" customer service department, you know help with what you can, and then route the other calls to their appropriate departments so that trained employees in those departments can assist. As time went on however managers began to demand that instead of you routing calls to different departments that you actually handle these calls yourself. Preposterous! I thought, you did not train (nor did you hire) me to do this \"Well use your resources\" managers would say referring to a centralized \"hub\" of information. But here was the catch - the new implementations that PayPal set forth and the managers who tried to enforce them told me that by all means necessary (other than transferring them to the department they needed to go to) that I needed to assist the customer who was again calling in for a different department, with a complaint, concern, or question that I've never heard of before while stumbling through \"my resources\" that I needed to take care of the caller in the same time frame that it would take me to assist customers with issues in which I've been WELL versed. Didn't make sense to me but I needed my job and enjoyed my $900 or so bi-weekly check. Plus the health i...more ProsFree gym, nice locker room, cool managers, nice coworkers.

PayPal generates their own calls by holding funds, restricting accounts and initiating limitations. Compliance equal control and improve perceived security. That's a good thing. Every call is a new experience. Literally. The hardest part of the job is seriously wanting to help the customer but being on minute by minute, every word you speak scrutinized. There are multiple systems that tweak handle times so the supervisors can manipulate the data to either praise or humiliate you as a human being. Which is wrong on so many levels. They use surveys to gage whether or not an agent is productive or not even when in fact their back end software is not cooperating. And so many agents are experts at pass the trash assistance causing those that truly care about customer concerns to appear lack luster and therefor non-interested. Which is not the case. Think about that though, the breeze by agents are rewarded but the by the 3rd or 4th call the customer is perturbed big time. So, if you cannot resolve the customer issue because of a whole host of system generated issues then your screwed. Try contacting their Merchant Technical Support by phone. You can't. They use a ticketing service and you guessed it, the customer never provides enough information, therefor they are closed out and never resolved. That's not a positive thing when your a large money mover, they use a payment processor, the...more ProsFlex time ConsOccurances, one minute late and your tardy 3.0 Customer Service Representative | Omaha, NE | Jan 29, 2016 Good In Between Job The interview process was quite overwhelming. Once hired, they welcome you with open arms. Send you a \"Welcome Aboard\" card. First day, they hook you up with PayPal gear and free meals in the cafe'. The New Hire training is 7 weeks long. First few weeks is telling you all about PayPal and the new great benefits you have acquired starting that 1st day. Health insurance, life insurance, 401k...the greatest benefits package ever. Affordable too. They have all their supervisors and head honchos that have been there for years come in and tell you about their journey at PayPal, they really talk it up. There are some really great people that work there. The stories are amazing and give you a lot of hope of building a career there. Once on the floor taking password reset calls. You learn what the metrics really are. Once they \"upscale\" (promote) you to another segment(department) you are thrown back into a classroom and get 4 weeks of overwhelming training, never quite getting it all and your given a team of \"mentors\" to help you on those first few times on the phone. Many times, those mentors never even took a call in that department your training for. Once in your new role, you are thrown on the phone and held to even tougher metrics and be careful with those transfers. Even if your getting transfers from all over the globe, even from eBay (just because eBay can) and just from other teammates that don't know what their doing, your just trying to get the customer in the right ...more ProsBenefits ConsManagement lacks consistency 3.0 Collection Agent | Chandler, AZ | Apr 17, 2018 It started out great I\u2019ve been with PayPal collections for a year. I truly enjoyed my job and the challenge it provided. Until the ridiculously changes started happening. While change is inevitable when your told two different things that contradict in the same sentence and then told if you don\u2019t do something correctly and you fail your bonus is taken away, it leaves a terrible taste. The lack of communication from top to the agents taking calls is absolutely terrible. We aren\u2019t told things until the day of or the day before when management knew for MONTHS. There is no true collaboration with the agents taking calls and the management. There was so many times I heard the phrases \u201cI am scared to do my job because I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right or not\u201d and \u201c I don\u2019t know what I am doing because no one has a right answer\u201d coming from tenured agents because of the insane amount of back and forth between policies and the grey areas. The absolute lack of advancement is a killer. It\u2019s not based off of true performance, but off of who you know and how well you kissed up. Whatever you do, don\u2019t mention anything potentially negative or offer a different perspective or solution to a problem,because that will not gain you any kind of true points. Now your on a list and say goodbye to moving up no matter how good your numbers are and your work ethic is. The life work balance is a joke. In order to make ends meet you have to work overtime and bonus. But if you make a mistake and fail a call you\u2019v...more ProsFree fruit, pto psl casual dress ConsLack of advancement, pay, lack of training and transparency 4.0 Customer Service Representative | Chandler, AZ | Apr 21, 2016 A challenging place to work With the exception of inconsistent upper management objectives, and poor inter-segment relations, in retrospect, this should have been a far more pleasant employment environment then what it proved to be. The flexibility afforded employees was considerable, complete with shift options, and lateral, as well advancing, positions. A typical day involved the receipt of calls from personal and business account holders from the Australian and New Zealand markets to resolve their partial and full account limitations/restrictions, the resolutions of which proved additionally difficult due to the consistently poor relations amongst support segments. The culture made for some peculiar work relationships, but overall, many of my teammates, especially the more recent ones, were quite a joy to work with. NOTE: In my segment, there was a consistently high turnover - always having new hires, and the promise of new hires. The hardest part of the job was having to provide \"talking-points\" to vehemently angry customers when there were no reasonable explanations for why their accounts were restricted, AND why the restrictions could not be resolved. The most enjoyable part of the job was many of my teammates, and my team lead; these were some wonderful people. What I mostly learned was how to creatively, and successfully service and resolve many extraordinary customers who had extraordinary challenges facing them due to inaccessibility to their personal and business accounts;...more ProsBenefits; flexibility; team/lead Constravel (local); poor inter-segment relations; upper management inconsistencies 5.0 Field Technician | Silver Spring, MD | Aug 10, 2018 A lot of challenges. Global company, with many opportunities. The importance of existence of a strong and dynamic high technology companies sector in the current world economy is enormous as it largely influences the potential for global competitiveness of individual nations or regions. In the developed, post-industrial economies the high technology companies sector is commonly regarded as the area with the largest use of and dependence on the so called special means of production \u2013 knowledge and human resources. These means are constantly created, which enables not only competition among individual companies but also has a positive effect on the surroundings (traditional industries, level of science, etc.). High technology sector also requires continuous and intense innovative activities as well as large research and development investments. Most of the previous studies of the high technology sector have focused on the issues related to methodology of measuring the research and development activities and its results, the amounts, structure and sources of financing, institutional solutions and the role of the state in stimulating the scientific and technological progress as well as on the issues of technological advancement in a wider context of innovativeness. However, there have been few studies of high technology companies\u2019 functioning and management.

They will bring you in from entry level and as long as you are flexible in your work hours you can move up quickly and gain awesome experieinces in leadership. However once you achieve entry level leadership you once again need to be flexible with schedule and at this point you are 5-10 years in and no longer can afford the flexibility when you have a family. If you can't be flexible you will remain entry level leadership. They still do reviews which are subject to manager opinion, goals fluctuate but for me I maintained high performing teams yet one quarter or half I will be an Exceeding expectations and then I may get a new manager who will rate me as a meets for doing the same work I did before. One manager will tell you its all based off performance, another says its the extra work you put into it, and then they change your teams so much it's impossible at times to remain a high performing team. They will be very respectful and helpful to entry level but it comes with a mental cost to higher up leaders who are over worked and under appreciated. recently many mid level leaders are stepping back down into entry level due to low pay as a leader, no work life balance, and low appreciation for the jobs they do. The best part is the people there, I have formed friendships for a life time and I also learned valuable lessons about coorporate business, structure, and it made me a very strong leader for it.

The work atmosphere is very relaxed. If there is a problem or an error one fixes it: no \"finger pointing,\" no \"blaming,\" no drama. Management is accessible and very helpful. The work is interesting. The upper management tends to get sucked into every new \"employee moral boosting\" trend to hit the market. Before I left they adopted a \"team meeting and Group Cheer.\" Which worked well for extroverts but the introverts were unimpressed. It would be fine if it was a short beginning of the day event, however with about 40 teams on a floor, the loud disruptive \"Raw Raw\" events lasted four hours every day. Ironically if PayPal did not have the following problems they probably would not need employee moral boosting events. Compensation tends to be low, the ability to advance is limited. The work structure limits the ability to \"network.\" i.e. one may know of an interesting team, but it may be in another building where your ID badge lacks clearance to get in. \"Production quotas\" and \"adherence to the work schedule\" prevents one from stepping away from the desk to talk to managers in other areas. New opportunities may not be open to current employees; e.g. when opening a branch office in another state, despite the announcing senior agent and management positions would be made available to current employees, all positions were filled by new hires; disincentives were slapped on anybody transfer...more 3.0 Agent | La Vista, NE | May 8, 2015 Pleasant co-workers, great benefits, and shift flexibility -- but management lacks communication My role is in compliance. We have set review standards and guidelines. The agents in my department are pleasant, knowledgeable, and are experts in a variety of topics/fields. The most challenging aspect of my role is the lack of effective communication from upper management. There is a high demand for the best quality of work in the least amount of time available, which is an understandable expectation of any business. However, upper management fails the agents in having expectations that are unrealistic. The standards are unobtainable because they vary according to the opinions and work standards of each shift/supervisor and do not solely rely on the procedural information available to all agents. This results in agents attempting to \"cut corners\" or focus solely on stats instead of doing the right thing and also results in inconsistencies. Additionally, the majority of meetings (of which there are many) fail to resolve these lapses in communication and primarily consist of placing blame on agents. Overall, the failure to effectively communicate, having redundant meetings that do not address the real issues, and taking the stance of \"if you don't like it here then get out\" provides a stifling atmosphere in which agents are expected to be doing their best. They do work hard to ensure their employees' shifts work well with their personal lives and provide 30-day sabbaticals every 5 years, which is a wonderful practice. Pros30-day sabbaticals every 5 years Consmanagement lacks communication and there are numerous redundant meetings. Questions And Answers about PayPal What is the interview process like at PayPal?
