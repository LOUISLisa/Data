Immediately we were told that we would be on a set schedule. The only good thing is we got to keep our pay. Our training in the department was nowhere near compared what a new hire would get even though we were going to be working in a totally different environment and billing system. I get so many calls from unhappy patients that are being billed either incorrectly (due to incorrect adjustments made from India billing team) or we billed to wrong insurance and I guess India does not do research before sending a balance to patient to try and work the account to the best of their ability. I also think this is the lack of education from R1 employees that work as patient access workers that register and load insurance. The company is all about money and we were just told that we cannot take certain days off even though we have the time. We actual have a \"bidding\" system that was just implemented by the supervisor that works in the department that is new to it and has never worked in a health care environment before and our time has to be requested in quarters. It is literally the slummiest system I have ever heard of. We also do not have sick time either. The supervisor did not pass any of the tests in training (she was in training with me) and she also is not trained to take calls. She gets paid to micro manage the department's time. I never know when I will have a day off and constantly have to check an...more ProsNONE ConsNONE 2.0 Registrar | Kalamazoo, MI | Aug 30, 2012 Wouldn't Recommend to Job Seekers I began working for Accretive in January and was quickly moved up from part-time to full-time employee. The work is steady and predictable, a typical day consisting of close to a hundred calls out to patients if you can manage between the insane number of inbound calls you receive from other hospital sites on which you're barely trained. The co-workers are mostly friendly and extremely helpful, you find a sense of camaraderie in being a \"worker drone\" for upper management. The management infrastructure is horrendous, placing too much pressure on middle management for production expectations, which affects the attitudes of the team leads and trickles down to the hourly employees. I was terrified of my team lead and had no idea what to expect walking in to work on a daily basis. Expectations are ridiculously high and demanding, laughably so. I learned a lot in this position about office politics, cattiness, assumptions, and management who doesn't place a value of any sort on employees who are willing to go the extra mile and work harder in order to meet corporate production expectations. The hardest part of the job has to be dealing with this management and the way it works, I always said if I was just speaking to patients all day, even the difficult ones, my job would have been delightful. The most enjoyable part of the job is twofold: First, there really are some wonderful people whom you have the opportunity to speak with and who can brighten your day and encourage you where...more Prosflexible scheduling, competitive pay rate, easy training, simple daily work Consunrealistic expectations, poor management, little empathy for employees, no grace for mistakes 3.0 Insurance Verification Specialist | Kalamazoo, MI | Jan 30, 2016 It's a mix of everything good and bad! I feel like Accretive is a mix of everything! I have been with the company for two years. I have been promoted once and am looking for a second promotion this coming year. So I feel the ability to move around is not as difficult as previous reviews state! I do feel like if you are too good at your job they try very hard to keep you put. So that is something you have to fight through, but if you know the channels, it can work to your favor! I can tell you that the trickle down of information is terrible! In one building there are three main units and they are all reading from different books. One department reads out of an instruction manual for routine office maintenance, one is reading action/adventure and the other is reading fantasy! But, with that being said, if you do your work and keep to yourself, what the other departments are doing will not matter to you. All of these reviews state that there is an issue with management. That is to be said with all companies and especially by former employees who are still a little passionate about their job loss. In my opinion there are several positions of management that are filled with people that maybe need to be retrained or demoted for their performance. I believe poor management styles and unclear corporate standards are the reason for the high turnover rate. I believe all of this is about to change!

I enjoyed my job at a fast food restaurant more than I have with this company. There are so many things wrong and they manage to keep it all hidden from you till you\u2019re in the job for about a month and then you realize just how bad it is. Trying to get ahold of the person hiring you is like pulling teeth, especially if you\u2019re not in IL where the company is based. I sent so many emails and tried calling the person that was \u201ckeeping in touch with me\u201d and heard back maybe once. Terrible staff load, couldn\u2019t get anyone to help cover my shift or the shifts around my shift. I worked my third shift ever, a grave shift mind you, by myself in an ER. They go through people like crazy. Upper management is a total joke, as well as HR. I expressed multiple concerns to them and they either ignored me or told the person that I had an issue with, that I had an issue, causing even more issues. There is no privacy, security, or action taken if you have an issue, and if there is action taken it backfires back onto you. Their policies are beyond ridiculous. Their policy implies that you\u2019ll never get sick, and if you do, tough news. You either show up or get written up. They don\u2019t accept doctors notes, even for a legitimate reason. I have run into the issue a couple times and couldn\u2019t take prescriptions the doctor recommended because I had to be at work, making it harder for everyone else to work with me because I wasn\u2019t productive and everyone had...more 3.0 Patient Accounts Representative | Kalamazoo, MI | Aug 12, 2013 No job security. Not very professional at times. Very critical. Nice people and Very friendly. Good place to work if you don't really know if you want to stay there forever. Accretive is not too professional most of the time and always has trouble with their new patient accounts system. There is NO job security at all. They are always on you about every thing you say or do on the phones. And you never know wether or not you will be fired. Other than that, I do have positive things to say about Accretive. The people there are very helpful and very considerate of others. Very upbeat people and the Team Leaders are always doing their best to strive for the company even though it is not too professional. Everyone there was always very friendly and never any drama. A typical day was on the Phone Dialer system and on the patient account system AHTO Contact. Taking and making inbound and outbound calls to help the patients resolve any problems or payments they need help with. Outbound calls were based on collecting for medical bills. So striving for a patient to pay was very important in my department. However, I really enjoyed my job at Accretive. And the friends that I made. Especially, my Team Leader, she was my first and only supervisor who went out of her way to help and strive for the best of our department. Even though she was sick most of the time and was out of the office for a while, she was still making sure that her team was still doing their best without her. She made my experience at Accretive very easy and absolutely great! Also, when I would have tr...more ProsAble to leave company to go out to lunch, GREAT people, Nice environment.

But only because since they fired me I've been unable to find gainful employment elsewhere. Literally, the only thing this place has going for it is the appeal to students. It provides pretty good work/life balance and hella good compensation, especially if you have the time to devote to full-time status. Other than that, this place is a mess. Too high expectations from senior management, too much pressure put on the team leads which trickles down to your hourly employees and creates frustration and lapses in communication. Moving up in the company can happen very quickly or painfully slowly, and neither is good. Production expectations are pretty much insane, and true customer service is sacrificed for those expectations, wherein rude employees with poor customer rapport are rewarded and \"slow\" employees with positive customer (\"patient\") reviews are punished. The climate that's encouraged is back-biting and filled with gossipy, high school-like drama. One team lead in particular plays favorites and can be extremely difficult to talk to and work with. Best advice? Keep your head down and mouth shut. Unless you're looking to work full-time, and then play the ruthless game, but also make sure you're covering your own tail at all times, or you can and will be taken down the first time they smell blood in the water.

I was a contract employee doing Medicaid claims for Radiology. During the last month, my immediate supervisor was out on medical BUT her supervisor was left as our acting sup. Anyways, she approved OT for us and we even clarified if we as contract employees were ok to take advantage of the OT. She said yes that the person who used to be in charge is no longer with R1 so we are good to go. I\u2019m not joking, I\u2019m a single mom with three growing boys. I worked as much OT as I could. Workflow would slow down at times and I managed my follow up time with a notebook with all info I\u2019d need to input on accounts (basically Medicaid ER for non citizens, which is tons of paperwork and printing and faxing.) well I\u2019d send all to printer and at end of day, I\u2019d print them all out, sort and fax. I even waited for transmission notices before leaving to go home. I studied things I may of had questions on to be more knowledgeable of my role. All this blood, sweat and tears and time away from my children and like that, my manager comes back and two days later, they let us go saying OT was not approved and we added time. I\u2019m appalled that they can just take someone\u2019s livelihood and can them like that without any talking to them about concerns. I admit, I\u2019m human and I may have made a mistake (very little if any) on my time are. If that\u2019s the case, TALK to ME!!!

Our customer base is unhappy with the way that things are communicated to them. They get angry because someone calls them to pre reg, but then they come into the hospital and the demographic information is not updated & we have to get the information from them again. They don't care that they have to repeat themselves constantly and they have to wait when they should be able to get their testing done without problems. Customers are also very unhappy about the billing aspect. They receive multiple bills and have paid online, but they keep getting the same bill sent to them over & over again. They make a payment by phone & never receive a receipt & nothing is documented in the system that we can see or other people from billing customer service can see. We also find that these same customers are receiving letters stating they are being taken to collections when they have paid their bills. I've even had instances where I faxed copies of payment receipts to the phone number they gave & I call 5 days later to check the status of the billing situation because the customer comes back in wanting to know if everything has been fixed & there is no documentation that I called or that they received the faxed requested documents...very frustrating for internal & external customers!!! I love the people I directly work with because they try so hard to work as a team, but if we don't have the necessary functioning tools to do our job, then no one is happy.
