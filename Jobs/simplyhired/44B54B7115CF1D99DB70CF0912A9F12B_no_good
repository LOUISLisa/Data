United States | Aug 25, 2018 A great company to work for, but you have to be able to see the good with some of the discomfort that comes with a big company that is growing rapidly I work in a Banfield Pet Hospital. My review is based off of my experience in the clinic and not as someone in a corporate office of Banfield. Some of the perk answers were hard to answer because associates in the hospitals don't have quite the same amount of perks as those in the corporate offices. The pros significantly outweigh the cons of working at Banfield. Banfield is a principled company that has an active mission and vision. When an associate has a difficult decision to make, they should always look to the 5 principles of Mars, and make their decision to promote the principles in their specific order. For instance, the five principles are: Quality, Responsibility, Mutuality, Efficiency, and Freedom. So, if you have the decision to make of staying in budget for weekly inventory, or going over and ensuring that your clinic has everything it needs, you go over budget to get those products on the shelves because the quality of medicine that we practice and the responsibility you have to provide the tools needed for doctors to do their jobs outweighs the freedom of profit principle. However, if this happens often, you probably need some support in learning how to do the weekly orders. I also like that they send out emails updating the associates on what they are doing to achieve the Banfield vision and how they are living up to the mission. Banfield focuses on associate engagement, which means they conduct annual surveys to gauge their employees satisfaction with t...more Prosfocus on work/life balance, competitive pay, benefits, PTO, skill building courses, continuous process improvement, associate development, associate engagement Constoo many acronyms, inconsistency of information, inadequate checks and balance system, opportunities with training 1.0 Veterinary Assistant | Santa Cruz, CA | Jun 6, 2019 Your hard work and concerns WILL BE IGNORED. I was wrongfully terminated after putting in my 2 week notice. After many meetings and emails about an employee who was not only harassing me but was harassing the rest of the staff and the doctors on duty, I was fed up and decided to find an employer who would stand by my side in a harassment case. I just gave my 2 weeks yesterday and I was wrongfully terminated a few hrs later. I was first told that my last day working at Banfield was June 28th (since I was scheduled out until then, and this location is extremely short staffed) and I was happy with that since I had told my new employer that I wouldn\u2019t be able to start until July 1st seeing as Banfield still needed my help. Now mind you before all this happened I had sent multiple emails to the manager and chief of staff about the harassment with no response and no changes to the harasser and he received no repercussions. This manner was supposedly sent to the \u201chigher ups\u201d with no change as well. This employee has an EXTENSIVE record of harassing former employees who had also left because of him. A doctor on staff had QUIT because of him and she clearly stated that. The current doctors on staff at this Banfield location have freely expressed that they both do not feel comfortable working with this employee as well. To give you a bit more history, no one at this location is willing to work. Myself and one other employee were the only full time VAs and we took most of the load seeing as the rest of the staff would not pick...more ProsDr.wells ConsDon\u2019t take matters seriously, problems go unheard, unfair treatment of employees, no lunches, unprofessional, zero accurate training 3.0 Coordinator | Vancouver, WA | Sep 18, 2019 Really would take just the right person to enjoy the job I am typically a positive person-however my experience at Banfield CTS (Headquarters) was very negative. I was hired as a Talent Acquisition Coordinator. This means I was part of a team of three that did all of the on-boarding for doctors, vet techs and practice managers. Three people covered the entire US. Which is simply not enough. The issue is there is a busy season, spring-summer. You will work OT and get no time off during this season and in the winter it is very slow. Not an ideal set up. Banfield promotes their inclusive culture but does not practice what they preach. If you are not drinking the corporate kool aid you will be singled out and treated differently. They have line managers in charge who have never done the work you are doing and have no way to advise you how to do the work or to assist you. You will have a weekly one on one meeting with your manager to talk about really I have no idea what because nothing productive ever came from any of these meetings. You are not able to ask for help because your manager has never done your job and cannot provide any assistance. When things were going wrong and I expressed concern or frustration her resolution was \"just be positive\". You will be promised the ability to work from home. This is not the case. It is case by case basis, some of your team will be given permission, some not. The work load itself when busy is practically unbearable and it is not unheard of for an associate to cry at work.

It depends on which Banfield you work at. No Banfield operates the same, it depends on the staff and capabilities. The focus is soley on Quantity of care and not Quality of care. There is a massive push to see more pets than the staff can handle. A doctor may bring this issue to the Practice Manager and lip service is played, they just keep at it or increase the work load. It is hard to feel good about the job you do when you see the Quality of care go out the window in favor of more money brought through the door. The OWP is a good idea, however it is poorly implemented in numerous areas. Banfields business model is quite frankly a mess beyond repair. Sign pets up on plan who are to aggressive to handle no matter what is done, the Owners are left with the 12 month payment bill. Sign up a Pet whose health is highly questionable...they die a few days, weeks or months later and again the Owner is left with that commitment of a bill. Cannot tell people no on a OWP sign up no matter what because it is money, plain and simple. People think the OWP is a insurance policy no matter how many times you tell them it is a preventive care package and break it down for them. People think they can come in at any time and have their pet seen regardless if the staff is overly loaded with pets than get mad when they can't get what they want. The staffing is run thin and highly rotational.

For the last 2 years, I was in a shift lead position - which offers a $2/hr increase. Benfield does not seem to truly appreciate their staff, despite preaching about how much they do- and this shows in their compensation. I helped to improve our location, met/exceeded wellness plan sign ups, kept our inventory stocked and within our spending limits, filled in for multiple hospital positions as needed, but still was not worth over $15.50/hr. At our location, most nurses were about $11-$14/hr, while other locations may have much higher salaries (no consistency) - if you do apply, ask for a higher amount, and definitely negotiate. Your Banfield experience can vary extremely based on your hospital management; I had 5 different managers during my time, and would say that I only had 1.5 GOOD ones. Banfield seems great on paper, but in actuality, they struggle with follow through on their promises. I have had changes to the schedule for the week of, schedule not posted past the end of the week, and worked 6+ days in a row - but if you get close to overtime, they will do the best they can to avoid paying you OT by sending you home early (sometimes causing the rest of staff to be overwhelmed). There were multiple days where we close at 7, supposed to be cleaned and out by 7:30, but did not leave until after 9pm. They are pushing to see more and more pets (they have a minimum...more 2.0 Client Services Coordinator | Multnomah County, OR | Dec 30, 2018 Corporates Dropping the Ball I used to be really happy here. Our team was amazing, our OSAT always high, meeting our pet numbers etc. We lost two PMs and at least three doctors in less than a year, and everything has been terrible since. The company cannot hold onto Doctors because they overload them, so hospitals keep sharing them or closing which has affected all of our para hours across the market. We went from regular 40 hour weeks to 20-25. Which I\u2019m sure is illegal but they\u2019re getting away with it. The para equation makes no sense, often leading the practice shortstaffed and the DVMs without help; highly affecting client and patient care. Practice Managers are leaving, even some walking right off the job after spending years with the company. They are so focused on cutting costs right now that they will do nothing to keep their good and loyal employees. However, they never fire anyone either. I\u2019ve seen staff give out medical advice, not show up for work, come in late, have terrible client service etc without any consequences. So sometimes you\u2019re forced to work with people that bring morale down and leave you to do most of the work with no recognition. The only way to get a raise is to have to fight for it at the right time-right now they don\u2019t even care if people are able to afford their rent. They push numbers more than they care about the patients or their employees-which is truly depressing considering everyone that works at my hospital truly, dearly cares about the patients and the ...more ProsThe people I work with, the training materials available, pto-when not used to make up for lack of hours, used to be flexible or set schedule ConsLeadership, Corporate, Overworked and underpaid, No accountability, Unrealistic Expectations, No support to lead to success 1.0 Client Services Coordinator | Colorado Springs, CO | Jan 1, 2020 Overall summary I went through my training, it wasn\u2019t very long to experience coworkers/the team being awful to me within the first month. I learn in my own way, every individual is different- they treated me like I was dumb. I am not dumb I learn through repetition that doesn\u2019t make me stupid or need to belittled. I had a coworker slap her arm on her chest and say hi to me \u201creferring to me like I was mentally challenged\u201d I do have learning disabilities so I felt extremely discriminated against, I am disabled physically, which isn\u2019t their business anyways. I had another coworker who would mock me after everything I was explaining to him about a \u201cclients question over the phone\u201d. For a company that strives on their five principles I definitely didn\u2019t see that in this company. I had other coworkers that would pick on me for no reason, as I would walk to the back to get my lunch people would call me weird to my face for no reason. My manager would call me out infront of the team and humiliate me, which was very unprofessional she could have approached me and told me what she needed, instead of making me repeat myself multiple times and belittling me infront of the whole staff. I had a tech scream at me on the sales floor infront of clients about scheduling a tentative appt when in fact I did not schedule it.

The managers don\u2019t care and play favorites. There is no room for growth unless your one of managements favorites. If your not vegan or workout on a daily basis, guess what? Your officially Ostracized and talked down upon. You want to learn and grow, guess again there not teaching you anything because it takes too much time out of there day.... They will also lie to corporate and make fake write ups to remind you who is in charge, whenever you try to report what\u2019s going on to corporate. They run the hospital like they own it, when they don\u2019t. They will also talk down upon and ridicule all the clients and there pets if they don\u2019t like there appearance or manner or they simply don\u2019t like you. If they don\u2019t like you, that means your pet does not receive the same medical care of a patient they do like. Oh and if your an employee don\u2019t expect quality care either, they will rush through exam/treatment and make small mistakes that could kill your pet (like they did to me) all because they were crushed for time. The Boynton location is the definition of slum and the drama there reminds me of high school, just with adults who don\u2019t know the definition of respect or quality medicine.

I quickly learned that manager expectations at Banfield were unlike that of other companies. Banfield has one goal in mind - make money at any cost. That cost being people, pets, morals and ethics. At the end of a day, there was never discussion of how many pets did we help. There was always discussion of how many more could we get on the schedule tomorrow and how much more revenue could we generate. In two years, I had three Field Leaders. Each one with a different management style but all driven by the dollars. Upper Management focus is on how many Wellness Plan enrollments can a hospital get in a day, how much revenue did each paraprofessional and doctor generate, cut hours or get more pets in the door. All the while, management never asks, \"How are you doing?\" or says, \"Great job\" unless your numbers on paper meet their goals. Be prepared to be a salesperson in this position. Be prepared to question your own morals and ethics as you are pushed to invade client's privacy to figure out the \"why\" to their \"no\" to a Wellness Plan. Be prepared to spend your days as manager as a receptionist or as a tech and have very little time to do what is expected of you as a manager. Be prepared to figure out your job on your own as training is sub-par for management.

Banfield spends so much money on marketing, creating positions for corporate office workers and developing computer systems/online training tools and acronyms for people in the hospital while never setting foot in one. There is a \"help desk\" and associate portals for concerns and questions and there is never a person on the other side of the line when you need them. It feels like all that money could be going towards the workers in the hospitals bringing in the business for the company. Clients expect prices to be extremely low, wellness plans are consistently used as insurance when they are not, high volume clinics, number of patients/production and \"drop off\" goals for hospitals set to ridiculous heights, miscommunications between hospitals, computer and faculty errors, so many higher ups that even your own practice managers have no freedom to run their own hospitals. Hospital workers are the back bone of the company but get treated like they are the lowest of the low while corp employees get a cushy office with a cafeteria and a gym. Everyone has an \"open door\" policy but when you confront higher ups about misconduct you are ignored.

My coworker said \u201cI don\u2019t participate in these you would be better off finding someone else\u201d - we are all at work/ a team it\u2019s not hard to engage. This job was so toxic it drove me to a place of hating my life, hating getting up to go to work, It was making me physically and emotionally sick. I don\u2019t suggest this job to anyone. You don\u2019t spend time with animals enough for it to be worth all of the treatment from the team, at least at this location. You don\u2019t get paid enough for running yourself dry and working most shifts by yourself, 10-12 hour days. They always send the other person home and put you up front, but don\u2019t care to properly train you. They care more about how many people they sign up for wellness plans. I feel they over see so many pets here I didn\u2019t feel each pet got a proper amount of time being seen. I have worked in many positions in my careers, and this was by far unprofessional, demeaning, toxic, harassing, and abusive. I highly suggest avoiding working here if your considering it. Answered Jan 1, 2020 Its really is dependent on your location. My locatio is wonderful! We are very family like and supportive. Our team works well together and issues are handled professionally (most of the time). Management is very open to hearing ideas and improving things.
