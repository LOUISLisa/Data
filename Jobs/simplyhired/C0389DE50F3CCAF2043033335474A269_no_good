Prosflexible hours Consmini tasks, no contract 5.0 Independent Contractor | Seattle, WA | Mar 8, 2020 I would say Amazon Mechanical Turk is very helpful when you need help you can email them & they send tips to help you with any problems or concerns. Amazon Mechanical Turk really help me when I needed help with money. Thanks to Amazon I can keep getting money in my account, which the HITs are not hard you just have to make sure you read & get a good understanding.The pay may be low & surveys can be long at times, check in the more HITs you get you can be qualified for higher paying HITs. 5.0 Data Entry Clerk | Mission, TX | Nov 25, 2019 It is a great company to work with because you work from home but the pay can be quite low if there are not very many projects posted by the requester I enter general information into their database is small to large batches of HITS. On some days, there may be up to 100 requested with 10,000 hits and on other days, especially after a holiday, there can over 300 requesters that have submitted and uploaded 100,000 hits. The money made depends on how long you actually want to work but the pay can average between $10 to $15 per hour. 5.0 Customer Service Representative | Remote | Jul 21, 2015 The best place to work if you put the time in. I love working for Amazon Mechanical Turk. The work is easy and if you dedicate the time you can make a decent income. The hard part of the job is nothing the work is always available. Prosworking from home or anywhere Consno cons 3.0 Mechanic | Chicago, IL | Aug 9, 2013 A Decent Side Job This is a self-motivated job that requires a lot of time searching for the most profitable projects. Higher paying jobs require a lot of time and effort. They are often the least available. Lower paying jobs are in abundance, and are a great way to get a feel for the site. This is how you create merit for yourself. ProsYou are able to work your own hours ConsThe payments vary from project to project. 4.0 Independent Contractor | Remote | Mar 30, 2020 Working with your own time but making sure to work time after you have been given an assignment. Its a good job since you work from the comfort of your own house. Most a times, you just correct mistakes on a given entry and partake in a research. Also, there are instruction on how they want a result and you just follow the given instruction and you will be good. Its a relatively easy job. 3.0 Independent Contractor | Seattle, WA | Dec 24, 2017 It's ok for college students Small amount of work for a few dollars enough to buy you a drink. Can work at anytime at your own pace. Very competitive as it is 100% based commission. ProsWork from home ConsLittle Pay 5.0 Human Intelligence Task worker | Remote | Dec 5, 2017 Awesome HIT's Human Intelligent Task (called \"HIT's) is doing a task that Artificial Intelligent has not learned how to do as of yet. It's fun and it's exciting and you get to work at your own pace and do whatever assignments you wish to sit and complete. It's good if you are a housewife with no children and love to work on the computer all day. You can make a couple hundred bucks a month. ProsWork at Home ConsPays pennies on the dollar 3.0 Mechanic | Pacific, MO | Oct 7, 2018 Nice place to make some extra income. I started working for Amazon Mturk several months ago. I did a lot of online searches about Mturk as well as read a couple of e-books about it. I learned as much as I possibly could to help me understand and to make more money. I was completely confused about adding extensions etc. but I hung in there. I mostly do surveys as I feel like it's the best way I have found to make the most money. As I complete more and more hits better paying hits are becoming available on a regular basis. I love the fact that I can get online anyime and make money. NO, working here will not pay your cost of living completly but it will pay a few monthly bills you have, and supply you with extra income. I really like working for amazon mturk! Proswork from home, extra income, set your own hours, paid quickly Conswhen things are slow there isnt always a lot of work available 2.0 Crowdsource Microcontractor | Simpsonville, SC | Jul 12, 2018 Stressful, time sensitive, and grossly underpaid Amazon MTurk is a platform for individuals, corporation, and organizations to microcontract workers to complete a task. The tasks can range anywhere from audio transcribing to completing psychological surveys. Payments rates vary from working for free to as high as $1 a minute. The problem though, is that high paying tasks are extremely few and far between. Most tasks pay less than 10 cents a minute. Tasks are also limited in number so workers compete against each other in order to claim their tasks before they run out. Many tasks are also very unethical, having users write positive reviews for services and websites on popular rating platforms, inflating website traffic, google search terms, etc. However, it is a very low commitment way to earn a little extra cash when you want to buy something. ProsMake your own schedule ConsLow pay, repetitive work, stressful work environment if you want to maximize profit Questions And Answers about Amazon Mechanical Turk What is the most stressful part about working at Amazon Mechanical Turk? Asked Jul 28, 2017 Working your way up to a decent pay rate takes too long Answered Mar 12, 2020 Very low compensation for work performed. Answered Jan 17, 2018 If you were in charge, what would you do to make Amazon Mechanical Turk a better place to work? Asked Jan 15, 2019 Encourage companies to just more per hit Answered Mar 12, 2020 To work super hard day by day Answered May 27, 2019 What advice would you give the CEO of Amazon Mechanical Turk about how to improve it? Asked Mar 16, 2018 Try respecting your workers just a slight amount. It might help, who knows. Answered May 14, 2020 I would reccommend better paying hits, and also a better way of contacting someone from mturk. Currently, there is no way to call anyone if you are having issues with mturk. YOu can email someone but usually there response is vague and seems to be like a pre-written response from a computer or something, not from a human. Answered Oct 7, 2018 What is the work environment and culture like at Amazon Mechanical Turk? Asked Mar 7, 2018 There is no culture or environment. Its just like going on surveyjunkie, or swagbucks, and wasting all your days chasing pennies. Answered Oct 14, 2019 You work remotely, so the environment is whatever you want it to be. There's no interaction except the people who commission you, and even then it's usually just in response to jobs. Answered May 31, 2018 Are the jobs that are available, remote work from home positions? Asked Oct 22, 2017 Yes. This is an at home job. Answered Oct 16, 2018 Yes, all are working from home. Unfortunately, you make about $0.10 per hour. It is not a reliable source of income. Answered Dec 16, 2017"
