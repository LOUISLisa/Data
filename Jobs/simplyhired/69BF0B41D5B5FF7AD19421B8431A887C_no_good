I was only 8 hours away and they refused me to go home, and my mother did die. ProsNone ConsThey simply dont care about the driver. Ther are just freight pushers. 1.0 Safety Coordinator | Nashville, TN | May 6, 2017 none this wasn't where I wanted to work. I didn't enjy my job here and didn't stay long at all. it was unfortunate but life goes on and I am with a better company now 2.0 Transport Manager | Atlanta, GA | May 7, 2020 Get the experience and move on !!! I would use the experience to move to a company that values your work ethic, and pays more, This company was a good company when the original owner was in charge, at that time the company valued their employees, and showed it. 1.0 Tractor Trailer Driver | Bethlehem, PA | Feb 26, 2020 Bad management & horrible work ethics. Lack of communication amongst from dispatchers and planners and csr's. This company is not bad. What makes it really bad is the management. Nashville dispatchers are the worst people ever. They do not care about drivers or their families. Its like us drivers have to be on top of them to make a move. We have to babysit grown people. Their miles varies as well. Fight for hometime as well. Miles are never consistent. Sucks. 4.0 Driver Manager | Bethlehem, PA | May 23, 2019 Productive and fast paced I worked for Western Express for 7 years in various roles as a driver manager, recruiter, orientation admin and seating manager. It is a fast paced environment with the opportunity to meet a lot of people. I enjoyed my time there, enjoyed the people I met and worked with. I would recommend it for an office position (whether driver manager, orientation, seating, etc), or a driving position (find a recruiter and division you are comfortable with). Prosmeeting new people, fast paced, pay and benefits. Consbreak areas needed or improved 3.0 Delivery Driver | Nashville, TN | Nov 2, 2017 this was a typical trucking company this was a typical trucking company. this was a typical trucking company. a typical day of work would have been driving up to 11 hours in a potential 14 hour day in all kinds of weather depending on how safety conscious you are. Proslate model equiptment Conspoor management 2.0 Truck Driver | Bethlehem, PA | Oct 28, 2017 Bad place to work. They don't take care of driver's well being Working there was very bad and the trucks where not in good condition. Always breaking down on the road. Working environment was very bad. They don't think of drivers safety. 4.0 Truck Driver | Plainfield, CT | Dec 13, 2019 Pretty good get your start company. Western Express is unique in the sense it gives most people a shot if they cannot get hired elsewhere. As the only company I have worked for I am biased inmy experience. Just finishing my 10th week as a New England Regional dry van driver i am satisfied as to my expectations of an entey level job in this rough neck industry. Pay is 750$ After taxes after 5 loads or 1700 miles that 5 day week and 100$ bonus for a 6th load as well as higher pay per mile. Highest paycheck to date was 1064$ after 6 loads and 2439 miles at .36cpm thanksgiving week. Lowest pay was after 2 loads 263$ and 800 miles at .36c. Totally my fault for not submitting paperwork so will get loads on neext paycheck. Took me about 6 weeks before I found my groove and things went more smoothly. The stress starting out solo is normal but will get less with experience. My miles over these 10 weeks have been great and loads consistent. If you mess up you may be put in detention for a bit until things catch up but will eventually so have patience and own up to your mistake if it was your fault. As you get better and prove yourself to be consistent in your daily work you will get better loads and will continue to do so until you mess up. After you will have to fix yourself and get consistent again and loads will improve based on trust. Don\u2019t sweat the small stuff as this company is used to newbies breaking stuff. Just learn from it and move on as quickly as you are able. The biggest thing to avoid...more 4.0 Director of Education | Nashville, TN | May 26, 2016 stressful and political there is always tension between operations and safety departments and the work environment is one of constant change and stress. don't mind the variety of tasks (change) but would feel more comfortable knowing my work is appreciated. the busiest desk always seems to inherit the bulk of the work load \"if you want something done quickly give it to someone that is already heavily loaded - they will deal with it quickly and move on\" Prosvariety, decent pay Conslong hours 3.0 Customer Service Representative | Nashville, TN | Nov 29, 2017 Western Express is an average company to work for Western Express had it ups and its downs. The were good days and there were bad days, A typical day usually involved arguments, some fun and a lot of work to get done. Questions And Answers about Western Express What tips or advice would you give to someone interviewing at Western Express? Asked Aug 15, 2016 Just walk out because they don't interview you. It's not worth the head ach you are going to have Answered May 9, 2020 Your company pay is not good..been that way for years..starting pay should be .50 per mile..toss out that sliding scale..seems like you are intent on taking advantage of drivers..period Answered Apr 1, 2020 If you were in charge, what would you do to make Western Express a better place to work? Asked Nov 16, 2019 Have more terminals from Virginia to Maine and I would have more trailers Answered Jul 2, 2020 Expand accounts Answered Jun 25, 2020 Is there orientation pay Asked Jan 2, 2017 You only get paid once you are with a trainer in a truck on duty. The time you sit in the motel waiting for one you get nothing. If you do flat bed you do get paid for the securement class. Orientation pay is only 400 a week so once they take taxes out on you. You will get abot 320 a week Answered May 9, 2020 No they dont pay for orientation, and if they tell you they do they lied, 400.00 dollars a week now that's a joke. You only make 400.00 a week if you work 7 days straight with a trainer and thats if your trainer feels like working. You get paid 57.14 a day while in training. dont recommend taking a cash advance because that's pretty much half your first check. Your constantly waiting on loads and the DM does ignore you which burns your clock and your pockets. You have to stay on them for your money. Answered Oct 6, 2019 What is the best part of working at Western Express? Asked Nov 29, 2019 They hometime ,fright and equipment Answered Jul 2, 2020 Opportunity to drive a tractor trailer and learn a lot Answered Jun 25, 2020 How do you feel about the future of Western Express? Asked Jun 14, 2018 It will never change because they know there is always going to be people out there that's going to work for them we are just numbers to them. Answered May 9, 2020 If the company \"is soooo bad\" why are they still in business Answered Oct 16, 2019"
