Started out as such a great place to work, but lately it's hard to find reasons to stay. This has become very apparent, as there are consistently 8+ job openings at any given time that can't be filled. The turnover rate is incredibly high. Once people start and see the type of work they have to perform for a minimal amount of money, they don't show up the next day. The wages were just recently increased, but are still not enough to compete with the current job market or growing cost of living. You can work at a fast food place for the same starting wage. They do offer benefits and PTO, as well as holidays...which I know is hard to come by. However, this job is high risk, requires months of training, and is monitored by the FDA. It's not simple work by any means. Raises are minimal, and based off a really poor judgement system. I've actually been told by a manager, they are not allowed to give a perfect review, even if it's deserved. There are people there who have been there 10+ years, making only a couple bucks more than new hires. There is absolutely NO room for career advancement, as they pride themselves on. Unless of course, you win the popularity contest. Talent, tenure, drive and knowledge have no effect on being able to advance. They will hire someone from the outside, for an entry level position, who will need much training to know the entire process, simply because they have a Master's degree(which is not required for the position). Many supervisors(not all)...more ProsMonthly catered lunch, some great co-workers, PTO, sick time, benefits ConsNo career advancement, favoritism, poor management, low wages, unprofessional behavior by higher ups 1.0 Pricing Manager | Mundelein, IL | Oct 8, 2012 Political Pressure Cooker A typical day of work would include reactive fire fighting because of inefficient processes and poor planning. You're typically expected to arrive early, skip/work through lunch, and work late. Especially when in a role that deals directly with the sales force, you should expect to receive irate phone calls from sales reps because they \"run\" the company. There is no system of accountability for how sales personnel treat operations and support employees, but the operations and support employees are expected to treat sales personnel with the utmost respect regardless of how they have been treated. In this aspect, the culture is quite toxic and stressful. Mid level and upper management is purely a game of cutthroat politics. The more people you can manipulate, the more control and power you will have. Most of upper management has no clue of the discontent at lower levels of the company, resulting in high rates of turnover. It's commonly known that management often hasn't the slightest idea what their employees are actually supposed to do. Lower management is called \"the working managers'. This is where the disconnect happens. The \"working manager\" role often is a salaried position in which you are required to work no less than 50 hrs per week. Other than the functions of their department, they have a full time work load and have no time to deal with their employees. In the common event that this \"manager\" was hired from outside of the department, they have no knowledge of the ...more Proscheap lunches, free employee gym Consno work/life balance, highly political, management does not respect workers, no training process 3.0 Warehouse Worker | Rogers, MN | Dec 13, 2018 An ok workplace. Not recommended I worked here no longer than 3 Months and in 3 Months this is what I realized about this place. The good things about this company is that they pay good, have monthly bonuses based on productivity and how fast you can comeplete a picking order, frozen TV dinners in a freezer if you\u2019ve forgotten yours. Smoking on property. Two paid 15min break and One paid 30minutes lunch. Straight away system, when picking you go one direction. No back and forth unless you skip the location or there is a problem and you come back to it. Now the bad things are coworkers, specifically Rogers Location, same with management. From my experience there are a lot of hate to each other as this place isn\u2019t a \u201cTeam\u201d based place. Especially when your bonus depends on your speed and productivity, everyone is for themselves. Management has a rule, \u201cIf you come across a problem fix it or you\u2019re the problem\u201d. By this, it means if you come across a location, let\u2019s say A1b2, and there is cardboard there write down the location turn it into management they\u2019ll take care of it. But never does. After turning in so much, they tell you or talk behind your back saying you complain too much. Long hours, there are two shifts, 8a-4p or 11a-7p. But then again, work is done when work is done. I was told at my interview here and there they\u2019ll have Mandatory OT. In my definition Here and there is maybe 2-3 days out of the 5 day week. But their here and there definition is 5/5 day week. Working 8-12 hrs depending on...more ProsBenefits, Pay, Bonus, Free Food, PTO ConsMicromanaged. Long working hours. Toxic Environment. No Team Effort. ETC. 2.0 Operations Associate | Canton, OH | Mar 29, 2018 Fast-paced and results oriented I worked at Medline's B43 branch for close to 2 years. I worked in a handful of positions during my time however given the way job titles work there my pay remained the same. Typical days started with a morning meeting then you're assigned your tasks. Things are heavily automated so once you received your task it's pretty straight forward what you need to do. There are quite a few things you can do but it you're pretty limited unless they teach you how to operate some of the heavier equipment and machinery. Once you get going most of your thought process is just replaced with either following on-screen instructions or listening to a robotic voice tell where to go next. Most people were friendly and the people who were institutions didn't seem too drained from working there 5+ years. However management was hit or miss. For example my direct supervisor was easy to talk to and capable of making jokes but sometimes when I expressed concerns of corners that fellow employees were cutting that made my job and the jobs of others harder it was met with apathy. To their credit though when I escalated the situation to a manager above their head I wasn't met with retaliation. The culture is seems great when you first start. You are usually enticed with what looks to be a great bonus program. Basically you can earn considerably more money on top of your paycheck by working fast and precise. However depending on what job your assigned can make this easy to max out or almost impos...more ProsDecent vacation, Occasional free food ConsShort Breaks, Bleak career growth 1.0 Shipping Supervisor | Rogers, MN | May 30, 2019 Extremely toxic and bad managed environment Medlines work culture is and has been extremely toxic. It\u2019s a performance based system to where it\u2019s difficult to get help because of the impact it will have on your performance or \u201cnumbers\u201d so people are either at the worst not willing to help or ignore you or on the other end just do whatever thing you\u2019re having issues with for you cause they don\u2019t wanna stop cause it will affect them negatively. So the training aspect is not very good. Sort of a sink or swim mentality. The hours can be negative to some being you have to stay until the work is finished. So that means either a 10hr-12hr day. The work fluctuates so there isn\u2019t any method to the madness it\u2019s just you stay until it\u2019s all finished. Culture has been bad for the 2 + years I\u2019ve been there. Management is the preverbal \u201cboys club.\u201d What I mean by that is they all are good friends and have used that to move themselves into positions of power even if they lack the skills to be successful leaders. The whole Rogers location is disorganized chaos and none of the leaders or management know what to do. But the employees suffer for such callousness because when everything is going badly, you can find the leaders doing nothing to help the situation in a positive manner. Wether that is hiding inside the office or watching videos on there cell phones. Wages are far below the average for the type of work. But they use the bonus system as a guise for underpaying there employees saying that if you work hard that you\u2019ll be compensa...more ProsWorking indoors, table pool and basketball court, free food, employee discount ConsMicromanaged, toxic, deceitful, belittling 1.0 Senior QA Technician | Waukegan, IL | Nov 15, 2011 Not the best place to work. The executives couln't care less about the employees making decission that affects the personal life of the employees. The divison that I am working is moving from the Medline SPT Building located at 1170 Northpoint Blvd in Waukegan, IL to the Corporate Building Complex Located at One Medline Place, Mundelein, IL. The distance between the two locations is 13.42 miles approximately , which is about a 30 minutes drive depending on traffic and weather conditions. This re-location of my workplace is causing me a lot of stress, anxiety and depression. I have transportation challenges that make this move very hard on me. This decision was driven by business needs without considering the impact on the people that makes this business successful (its employees). Besides my transportation challenges this move will arbitrary take away at least one hour of my personal time per business day due to the extra 13.42 miles of commute each way; that would be about 29 days per year ! Additionally that will include an automatic cut on my paycheck due to the increase in transportation costs (if I figure that out) and an increase on daycare and afterschool care for my two children. In addition to the above, this move also affects the distance of my children location. Currently I am 15 minutes away from my daughter\u2019s school and less than 10 minutes away from my son\u2019s daycare. This means that in case of an emergency, like it has happened before, I can be with my children when they need me in a short period of time. This is very important to me because I don\u2019t have any family here in IL to help manage this type of...more Prosvacation, sick & holiday time Consnot so good expensive medical insurance, poor pay 1.0 Driver | Katy, TX | Aug 6, 2015 wont stand up for employees at all, 100% not looking out for drivers, Transportation supervisor is a joke. He is only out to make his bonus, absolutely wont stand up for his own employees, he is on a power trip, and wants to show his drivers he is in charge. Complains about hours worked, wants everyone off the clock asap, asks why you are driving 63mph instead of 65mph, Company policy is \"no using electronics of any sort while driving\". no phone, no bluetooth, no CB radio, if someone calls in and even says you were on the phone, your suspended immediately, you have to give your phone records or loose your job. Warehouse is a joke as well, inexperienced warehouse workers dont wrap pallets correctly, they fall over causing more time for drivers, which in turn gets you asked about your hours. When you explain that the pallets fell over or were messed up, you hear well work with us on that they are new! BIG BROTHER WATCHES EVERTHING YOU DO, they know EVERY SINGLE MOVE YOUR TRUCK MAKES, I learned that they will take away your bonuses quicker than a blink of an eye, which is their claim to fame about pay being so well. One of the two lead drivers is a great person to work with, he will help you with anything, the newer lead driver, will be your friend to your face, but will stab you in the back quicker than most backstabbers. Huge company, with tons of money, not afraid to share if you earn it, but, they cant keep drivers because of the way that they treat employees, Hardest part of the job isnt the actual work, its wondering if you ha...more Prosif you can keep from getting your bonuses taken away, they are nice. Consno job security, they will fire you for anything, dont trust what you say 5.0 Trainer | Lacey, WA | Sep 2, 2018 Productive and Serious warehouse with high job security Due to the industry, (it's a warehouse job in the medical supply field) the job security is pretty much guaranteed, so that's a plus. The downsides are that you can't leave until your workload is completed, since orders *must* go out. It's medical supplies that hospitals and home care providers HAVE to receive, so leaving at the supposed \"end of shift\" doesn't happen. Supervisors do work hard to lessen overtime, but it is a given and I'm hoping that the work/life balance improves as the company grows and hires more team members. As with any warehouse job, if you play politics and do what you can to be noticed as well as do a decent job with your work you will be looked at for promotions and it's not difficult to move up. However coming in and doing your strict job outlines will get you paid (nice bonus incentive programs too!) but you won't move up anywhere without making friends. Best part is definitely all the employee benefits and the incentive pay programs in place. This company does what it can to at least attempt to show employees that the corporation cares, which is more than most companies so I applaud them for this. We received a Christmas bonus, free holiday turkey or ham, lots of barbecues and catered lunches, free passes to local events, and a bunch of other small gestures that add up to make it a decent experience here. They reward perfect attendance, high accuracy, fast performance, and a few other categories but you can definitely make additional mone...more ProsBenefits, healthcare discounts, incentive pay, holiday events, competitive pay Conslong days, lots of employee gossip, every-team-member-for-themselves-mentality 3.0 Warehouse Worker | Orlando, FL | Jul 7, 2017 A fair balance of good and bad: a job. The job: Medical supplies. Multiple shifts. Shipping consists of picking product with a voice activated system until the line counts are met. Picking is performed on pallet riders, order pickers, and by foot, which is the most challenging. If you\u2019re a loader, you\u2019ll get assigned trucks and have to consolidate product from their different picking zones. Receiving and put-away is performed mainly with reach trucks. The job is relatively easy, product is not heavy, repetitive like in most warehouses. The good: Great company to work for with really good and inexpensive benefits. Excellent amount of PTO hours within the first year. Solid job security if within performance expectations. Mon-Fri schedule for most, with one shift being Sun-Thu. You\u2019ll like the concept of what you do and a great team to work with. Good compensation with the many bonuses \u2013 it pays to be on-time and not calling in for example. A good workout, but not back breaking. Way cleaner and cooler than most warehouses without air conditioning. The bad: This company services the health sector, which is a really busy one that doesn\u2019t sleep, for a good reason. Shifts are odd, no 8 to 5 here. Over-time is consistent with 10, or more, hours work days being the norm. You don\u2019t know at what time you\u2019re going home until later on your shift. If there\u2019s a holiday, they will distribute that workload onto the other days on the same week. A computer tracks your time which generates your bonus and performance numbers.

ConsWork/Life balance, not knowing finish time. 3.0 Director | United States | Feb 26, 2019 Uncontrolled growth could lead to future challenges Medline Industries is a medical supply manufacturer with distribution capabilities able to provide services throughout the entire continuum of care for a hospital system. The percentage of self manufactured & private label products offered by the company currently provides the company with a competitive advantage in the market. Because Medline can offer low distribution markup's on an extensive list of products, the total cost to a health network is significantly reduced. This has led to a steep revenue ramp over the last few years, with the company gaining significant market share at the expense of one primary competitor. The investments being made by the ownership of this privately held company are notable. Significant expansion in infrastructure is underway with a focus on facilities, technology, and personnel. The future is bright for Medline. Because the company is privately owned, not all employees are able to reap the benefits associated with the remarkable growth. There is not an ESPP, Additionally, the compensation is approximately 20% - 30% below market for some specialized positions. The sales team does very well, but others do not. The culture of the company is entrepreneurial. The fifth generation of family leadership is making its way through the ranks of the organization and there is every reason to believe that the positive results will continue.
