This abundance of features is libp2p\u2019s key strength. Many of our downstream users started out trying to write their own peer-to-peer networking layer and then, upon discovering how complex it is, decide to adopt libp2p instead. With Go, JS, Rust, Java, Python and NIM implementations, the libp2p framework is available to a wide range of developers targeting everything from SoC\u2019s to browser-based applications. What\u2019s it like to work at Protocol Labs? Protocol Labs mission is to improve humanity\u2019s most important technology, the Internet.
