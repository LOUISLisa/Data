Questions And Answers about Alaska Airlines What tips or advice would you give to someone interviewing at Alaska Airlines? Asked Aug 21, 2016 Always make eye contact with the interviewer and know your facts instead of guessing. Answered Nov 9, 2019 Be early to interview... do your research on online job forums . Be involved but not over the top. Follow directions of recruitment team not the person in front of you ... It's important to stand out, so pay attention to what they go over ( it will come up in f2f later in the day ) look professional (gentlemen wear tie and socks) yes I had to say it. Answered Oct 28, 2018 What advice would you give the CEO of Alaska Airlines about how to improve it? Asked Jan 16, 2017 Show more compassion for your employees as you do for the guests. Try not make profit more important. And don\u2019t pretend there is diversity with a few tokens here and there + reevaluate the supervisors in Customer care, their hoods are peeking out from under their clothing. My 1st personal experience with the CEO was a train wreck but the CFO made up for it because he knows what compassion is about, take a page Mr Tilden! Answered Dec 6, 2019 You as senior mgmt needs to take care your employees first, these people make you what you are today and the company Answered Aug 20, 2019 What is the interview process like? Asked Aug 3, 2017 Hiring event started at 7:30. It starts with a few presentations with Q&A, then there is a group activity, then they ask you to wait around until your interview time.
