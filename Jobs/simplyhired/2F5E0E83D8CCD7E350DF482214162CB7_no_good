Freight I was promoted 5 times in 5 years but after my most recent promotion back to the terminal, I learned very fast that my new Terminal Manager was racist to say the least. I asked me to do things that were immoral and not ethical. I left the company because I refused to compromise my moralities and feelings towards colored people any longer. There is no work/lfe balance and when my father was dying of cancer and flat-lined on the table I came to the realization that this company does not care about their employees and had little to no regard that we as people do have families that come first over any job. The man even went as far as cutting back full-time employees hours because he said and I quote \"here are too many nice cars in our parking lot....\" When I went to my regional manager about my supervisors stating/thinking our new Terminal Manager was racist I was told that if I went to Human Resources or if the conversation lett the room he would not reconsider firing me and would be sure to find a valid reason to do so. After that, even though I was making great money, I knew it was no longer in my best interest to continue employment for a company that condoned those values/beliefs. It may be hard for me to make up the time I spent \"climbing the corporate ladder\" and having to live on a very tight budget, but I sleep better at night and feel it is/was the best decision I ever made to leave that company and find something new, even though I was promoted several times while with...more Prosyou are not allowed to sit down and eat and 65-70 hour work weeks are mandatory not voluntary Conslack of technology, lack of equipment, little to no regard to both salary and hourly employees, immoral values and compromising/non-ethical ways at making numbers 2.0 Driver | Conyers, GA | Jan 2, 2020 Free hamburger offered on once a year cookout. Performance times calculated from incorrect clueless sophomoric algorithms. The engineering department has virtually zero understanding of actual procedures in trucking company operations. This results in thousands of man hours wasted on a daily basis. The daily unnecessary time delays spent by drivers is never viewed as a safety issue. Drivers are coming to work as much as two hours early due to operational problems at the terminals. The wasted two hours comes out of the drivers sleep. The safety department is run by politically appointed directors with no professional experience in actual driving conditions. Clueless policies are put into place and actual safety issues are neither understood nor addressed. Drivers are constantly put into extremely dangerous situations due to out of touch-non sequitur \"safety\" policies. For example: Drivers are told to brake hard in order to avoid tripping the distance sensors. Instead of using in truck safety devices to improve safety conditions, they are used as weapons to attack the drivers. Wrecks are often caused by zero tolerance dispatchers who send drivers out in dangerous conditions. When the wreck occurs only the driver is held accountable for the accident. The dispatchers and dispatch policies are protected with a legal firewall and are never held accountable for their decisions. The managers who have had actual professional driving experience have shown to be much better at making the system work properly. The manager...more ProsGood managers and good policies make SAIA safe and efficient.

You will start at 19.74 and not see 23.65 for 18 months, its a revolving door, good drivers quit on the spot constantly and they could care less on why you quit you are ALWAYS wrong and they are ALWAYS right , corporate will not have your back they allow the supervisors to treat there hardworking drivers like dirt. you will be TOLD to stay home weekly when your trying to feed your family. the only people that were nice were the girls in the office. 18 plus stops a day of back breaking work you WILL go into residential neighborhood's with a 48ft semi to deliver one box from amazon.com they wont get box trucks for that stuff and you will risk your CDL Daily with all the dangerous obstacle's they put you through. you will be on call daily no set schedule they will lie right to your face in the interview don't plan nothing during the week you will peddle 18 stops all day and told to bring it in then on way in you will be told when you get to the yard hook to an empty and go swap and confirm 30 bills one by one before you can go home, they are rotten inhuman s...more ProsDirect Deposit ConsMANGEMANT -Equipment 1.0 Supervisor | Cincinnati, OH | Jun 11, 2014 Worst Freight job I have had. There is a reason this company pays the way they do.. If not, they would have no employees.. That goes for dock workers, drivers, and supervisors. They push their employees beyond limits, full time employees to be exact. If you are part good, its a good job as they cant force you to stay like the others. Their culture is to push their employees beyond breaking because they wont hire as many employees as they need. Same goes with equipment. Employees stand around waiting on equipment or get sent home as the company believes less is more apparently. Upper management wont change their tactics. Managers and supervisors aren't allowed to run things the way they know it should be run, which is turn causes backlogs, employees to quit, and freight not to be delivered in a timely manner. As a supervisor I talked to customers a number of times a day asking why their freight was not delivered. All I could say was it was put out, unfortunately for some unknown reason it was not delivered. This was caused by to much freight and not enough drivers. I came into a load of problems everyday caused by not enough drivers. And they wonder why there are so many complaints... Upper Management just says get it delivered without giving any more resources or a helping hand. This company is a joke.. DO NOT APPLY FOR A JOB HERE. All the good reviews are by either part time employees which don't see the real problems at this company, or are employees from their Home Office writing good rev...more ProsGood pay and Benefits ConsEverything else. Bad work enviroment. Long hours. Changes never made.. 1.0 Local Driver | Spokane, WA | Apr 1, 2019 Video Camera harassment It was a hard job. I was there for about 4 months. Everything seemed to be ok; until they started harassing me with the driver facing cameras. I think it got slow and they needed to get rid of one of the new guys. I got 10 little video write ups in the last two weeks working there. They were for stupid little things. They fill the files of drivers they do not like, and leave other drivers alone. They act like it is some unbiased system but its not. Senior drivers can pick the truck with less sensitive cameras and some had none at all. After learning the job and getting everything down; they started doing that to me, and I quit. Spying on me all day showing me videos of my and my face driving around trying to find something I did wrong. It was horrible. The company culture is the most paranoid and hostile place I have ever worked. Management act like jerks for the most part, and treat you like garbage. Its not really a safe job when it comes down to it. They made me rush around in a 48 foot trailer with a liftgate in housing developments and downtown small alley ways. Low power lines and trees are always a danger, and then they blame you or make a big deal about it; if you break a little tree branch. It was a pain to work there; but that video harassment was the worst. I called the HR harassment line; but that was worthless. They just say its all about safety. They pay good; but other than that; that place sucks. Low moral, and hostile. Prosgood pay Consvideo camera harassment, hostile work environment 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Boise, ID | Feb 27, 2015 Call Center Customer Service The pay was decent. However, job security and satisfaction were low. They stick you through a month of training, which did not address actual flow on the floor. Many of us went home stressed crying each night overwhelmed. Once out on the floor 75% of the calls were angry of customers demanding to know where their driver was, or why they have not received their package. Now if you did not apologize enough to the customer, your performance was docked. If you did not apologize enough you would be eliminated. Management seemed caring but when trouble actually arose they would not help with customers, and if you tried to reach out to the terminal they would say you need to be confident and lie to the person. If you contacted the individual terminal too much to find out what was going on because you cared, you would get docked. I dont know how many times they would call back the minute before closing and you'd get stuck on an hour long call of a customer yelling at you because the terminal did nothing and wouldnt try, and none of the management would help. You'd then be docked points for staying over on your hours. I think its sad companies can take advantage of their employees, my coworkers were constantly told, this is how jobs are, you would be lucky to find something near this good because the pay is so high here, and they buy it, and stay miserable. ConsEverything 5.0 Terminal Manager | San Leandro, CA | Jun 11, 2018 Excellent company with integrity and a constant strive for improvement Managed day to day operations and sales for norther California region over two facilities. Responsible for all aspects of the business: staffing, revenue growth, service levels, profitability, fleet management, team development, sales staff, and safety compliance. Developed a service driven and safety culture that produced excellent results. Most enjoyable aspect was team development and grooming key players to take on roles of advancement. Our team Over a 2 year span improved from the lowest producing facility to operating at 134% of goal which resulted in winning the presidents club award for operating at the top 2% in the nation. Team building and leadership is my passion. That passion has been the key to my success. The asset side of transportation comes with difficulties or what I would rather call challenges. The most prevelent was making sure we adjusted to the day to day revenue fluctuations and control costs by being proactive by recognizing trends and or being able to react and make immediate calculated adjustments to absorb in increase in activity or decrease. Prosfull autonomy coupled with excellent support and resources. ConsWould have liked to see more visits from executive staff help validate vision and company direction. 1.0 Local Driver | Charlotte, NC | Sep 18, 2017 Disappointing company most days. I have been employed by Saia for several years as a driver. Pay is average for LTL. Exceptional benefits and vacation. Frustrating place to work. Upper management and sales team don't understand day to day operations or our customer needs. Middle management is spread too thin. Managers have multiple terminals and operations suffer. Preach safety but push unrealistic stops per hour goals and difficult routes with home deliveries that shouldn't be performed in a tractor trailer. Driver facing cameras that were supposed to be a training aid have now become a tool for unnecessary disciplinary actions that could be easily coached. Will not communicate what actions are grounds for suspension and seem to be constantly changing the rules. Certain terminals damage freight on a regular basis but when addressed it never gets resolved. Missed pickups and deliveries get reported improperly so it doesn't hurt company numbers. Undependable service because too many deliveries for miles driven. Continuous driver turnover and hard to recruit quality people because of company reputation in the driver community. Would not recommend employment because too many competitors with similar jobs. ProsAverage pay, good benefits ConsUnclear expectations, doesn't value good employees. 1.0 Driver | Fresno, CA | Oct 23, 2018 Frustrating & Stresful The culture at Saia was the worst, & it all starts with management. The terminal manager was never around & was impossible to get in touch with, didn't return calls or text messages. The morale was very low, if management doesn't care, why should the employees. Most of the other drivers were very helpful, and made the job tolerable. The company was completely unorganized. They do things one way, and the next day do the complete opposite. Very poor use of drivers: more drivers than freight going some places, and more freight than drivers going other places. There is no forward planning/thinking, just reactionary. Very poor communication, and ridiculously long wait time trying to get in touch with dispatchers/ central dispatch. The equipment is junk and very poorly maintained. A lot of drivers just park the trucks without writing it up or letting someone know what is wrong with it, and leave it to breakdown on the next driver. The ELD system freezes and crashes constantly, and when it does work it doesn't keep accurate records. You will always be \"just a driver\" to them. No opportunities to advance and grow within the company. Drivers are extremely undervalued here ProsPay & Benefits. Weekends off. ConsEverything else 1.0 Driver | Chicago, IL | Dec 15, 2012 No regards for their employees Safety department is racist. They never want to listen to their employees and they will just shove you a form to sign, and if you don't they threat you that they will fire you on the spot. Wondering if I should sue them for the racism. Every time it gets closer to the winter season and they do not need so many people they will throw you out in the cold with out second thought. Never received my last pay check. When called HR they gave me a run around. Management is rude, and they do not care about their employees at all. They had a brochure on their website stating \" every employee deserves to be treated with respect\" and with that in mind you could complete ARC form and send it to the VP of HR for an appeal. Don't kid yourself. The number that they had to call for the form was for a building company and no one had knowledge of the form. Once received the form after calling around and sent it in (certified mail like they requested) nobody wanted to sign for it. Hope to receive my pay check one day. HORRIBLE COMPANY TO WORK FOR. ZERO RESPECT FOR PEOPLE. Prosinsurance Conssafety department is racist and the management doesn't care about its employees.
