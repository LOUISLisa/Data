OH Overall Reviews at Central Transport 1.0 Truck Driver | Vandalia, OH | Sep 10, 2014 Worst place to work Worst company I have worked for in my history of employment. I was asked to break DOT laws by the company by driving trucks with expired registrations. Promised to have my fines paid if stopped. Really? Trailers have been over-loaded on more than one occasion. Management always asked if the scales were open cause its gonna be too heavy. I was made to drive some of the worst trucks imaginable. Trucks falling apart and in excess of a million miles or more. Was rare to find one with a working air conditioner on a 90 degree day. Its fun to drive sweating in the evening sun. The terminals have such large potholes in the ground that you could call them fishing holes. If you hit one in the dark, you will total the truck. The forklifts at the terminals billow white smoke. The place is so dirty you blow your nose and black comes out. Bathroom at one terminal had 1 working toilet for a crew of 20 workers. The sinks were flooded due to a downpour and the excess water poured out of the urinals onto the floor. The freight is damaged so bad due to over stuffing the trailers that I couldn't imagine delivering that stuff to the customer. Trainees are trained on forklifts in the middle of a busy terminal. Barely any skills at all and are forced to work in a fast environment with people flying all over the place. Way to be safe Central.. As far as safety, there is none. Once on a forklift leaving a trailer, I reached the dock in time to see the trailer pulled almost out...more ProsPay is decent ConsEverything else 1.0 Dispatcher | California | Apr 13, 2019 Thankless company that doesn\u2019t care about its employees at all If you ever want to work your butt off every day only for you to not be appreciated this is the place for you. Long days with no breaks,broken promises, constantly changing, unsanitary, horrible benefits. Have you ever heard \u201cnot all money is good money\u201d well here you will leave every day stressed out and arrive stressed out. Only to be stressed out by corporate. Ever worked somewhere you had to bring your own water? Ever worked somewhere where you literally hear people\u2019s butt when in the bathroom because your desk is 20 feet from the toilet with no door? Ever get written up for something they told you was ok upon recruitment? Ever been given a day off for a holiday and NOT be paid for it when you\u2019re salary? Ever had a mouse run up your leg while sitting at your desk? Imagine being told upon recruitment you get a 1 hour lunch only to be told 3 months in that now it\u2019s half hour and oh btw you need to work an hour later and no you won\u2019t be compensated. Oh and btw we don\u2019t take breaks around here Imagine your chair that you have to sit in for at least 9.5 hours a day was broken, lopsided, and they didn\u2019t care. Imagine being a supervisor and talking to a driver only to have the driver almost wanna fight you only to have the manager sit there like he\u2019s waiting to see a fight. Never reached a single bonus. Never had a single review. Never offered a single raise (15 months) And when I resigned my check was short for my last week. And I still haven\u2019t...more ProsIt\u2019s better than nothing I guess ConsNo breaks, broken promises by management, reduced lunch time, extended shift without compensation. 2.0 line haul | St. Louis, MO | Apr 7, 2013 Work hard for Less pay. This is the place They pay you line haul .33 cents a mile and you have to work a 14hr day. So you drive 400-450 miles round trip (no problem). Once you get to the STL terminal you wait at least 15mins for a dock door. Then you have to unload your door, while driving on a pot hole filled warehouse floor. Warehouse is nothing more then a oversize car port. Never saw a warehouse floor so dirty in my life, half the lights was or about to burn out. Driver/dock workers crushing customers freight, while loading are unloading. The P&D driver get better pay and they dont have to work the dock after their shift. How is this possible? Line haul gets .33 a mile, they get $60 bonus a week (up to 5 weeks) and a $2000 sign on bonus that takes a year to collect. I see why this company has a huge turnover rate, because drivers are getting tired of taking up the shoot. This company is where drivers to go died, like a elephant graveyard. Posted Dead End. Oh one last thing. A driver walked into CT dispatch, with he CT hand held and gas card. I was talking to the dispatch operator (i guess), he was talking me i needed to work the dock for 2hrs. I told him when i was hired CT corporate told me i olny have to work 12hr, because i needed to get home to my working wife to watch our baby. The line haul driver who walked into the dispatch office said, \"Are you in charge on this shift?\" Dispatch said, \"yes\". Driver, \"Alright well cool man, here is my hand held and my gas card i quit\". I was shock, dispatch didnt ask why ...more Prosdriving Consdamage to customers freight, no structure, old trucks trailers, pay 1.0 Driver | Michigan | Nov 25, 2016 Absolutly Horrible! Equipment is completely unsafe and worn out. Some of the trailers don't even have brakes. When you inform someone they just tell you \"Yeah we have a few like that\" Tractors are literally taped together, trailers are full of holes and should not even be on the road. You literally have to push on the doors with a forklift to get them shut, which is completely unsafe in itself. More than once I had to tie the doors shut because they wouldn't latch, hoping the over loaded thing wouldn't bust open and cause a fatal 200 car pile up. God help you if they throw you on the dock. There is no heat and water freezes on the floor. Watch out if you don't want to slide through a dock door which has long been broken and will not shut. If you have no experience operating a forklift expect to be belittled and harassed instead of trained. A typical day includes driving a truck that probably will never make it over 50mph, sliding through a stop light or two because probably only one brake works on the whole rig, getting a ticket because the headlights flash on and off like a Christmas decoration, fighting the doors and landing gear for an hour or two, calling dispatch and being talked to like a 5 year old then finally getting back only to be written up for wearing the wrong color of pants. I couldn't even recommend this job to a newbie because a newbie wouldn't necessarily realize how dangerous of a situation he is in and end up ruining his whole career if not his life. The pay sounds...more Prosmost co-workers are good guys in the same hopeless situation as you. ConsYou will probably have an accident. 2.0 Senior Account Executive | Cleveland, OH | Feb 24, 2016 Central Transport was a very challenging company to work for. A typical day at central started at 7:00 am with office time to respond to and send e-mails to customers and other members of the organization. I would typically make two face to face sales calls in the morning, have lunch with a customer, and then make 2 face to face sales calls in the afternoon. I returned to the office to follow up on the days calls, submit pricing, enter call notes, complete reports, follow up on customer needs, send e-mails and put together materials needed for the next day's calls. These items would be presentation materials, contracts, pricing, accounts receivable issues, claims issues, and billing issues. I took time every day to prospect new business, both in person and on the computer. I was responsible for continued sales growth, constant addition of new accounts, managing territory receivables, monitoring service levels, and supporting operational needs with the right mix of business. There was very little contact with management unless I reached out. I communicated regularly with co-workers and supported them when they needed it. I didn't find any part of the job hard, but was often frustrated by the lack of company support in making customers happy. I very much enjoyed working with and growing my customer base. I built very strong relationships with all my customers through strong representation, quick follow up, strong support and handling all their needs. ProsGreat technology, good compensation, good job flexibility 1.0 Driver | Richmond, VA | Dec 17, 2013 Terrible company to work for Your start times constantly change so you can never really get set in your morning routines. Your routes change constantly and seniority only matters when it benefits management. Management do not consider what's valuable and important to the drivers. They also take no pride in the equipment we use which 9 times out of ten is broken down, old and really unsafe to use. Your end time can be at any time as far as when you get off work each day. You can work anywhere from 8 to 18hours, it really just depends. Flexibility with this company is an understatement and the company really just takes advantage of the hard workers and puts more on them versus pushing the not so hard workers to do their job or get terminated. Their customer service is horrible such as sitting on the phone for 40 min for fuel just to be hung up on. A lot of management has never even driven a truck so they really don't know what we go through each day. They do not listen to the drivers when it is about the driver, but only listen when its going to make a profit for the company. Their benefits are the worse. The company even owns the insurance company and we still get more money taken out of our checks and have more out of pocket expenses and deductibles than the insurance pays. They do not even care whether or not you get to take a lunch or not throughout the long days delivering and picking up their freight. Moving freight is their number one concern NOT the drivers. ProsNone ConsEvery thing about this company 1.0 Sales Representative | Chicago, IL | Apr 22, 2016 Beware Where to start, just a very rough company overall. Every customer is unhappy with the service. Service is either LATE or DAMAGED AND LATE, or the shipment is LOST or STOLEN. Then there is the issue of incorrect billing- CT nickels and dimes every penny possible. Customers get upset and don't pay the invoice and then their freight is held hostage. Damages- the absolute highest claim ratio in the industry, if the customer actually walked the dock, they would throw-up. Claims are NEVER PAID, the Claims DEPT hides behind an email, and DENIES EVERY CLAIM! A majority of the employees are stressed and burnt, that's probably why they just gave up and don't care. The absolute worst operations in the industry, but its the ownership and upper management that ruins the company, they just don't care and why bother staying in business- shut it down. The rates are low and that's what customers like, BUT you get what you pay for. Now Upper MGMT thinks they can have ANYONE sell there GREAT SERVICE with the LOWEST RATES- Titan more like TITANIC. Equipment is very bad and major safety concerns, you here stories of new equipment but you never actually see the new equipment. The pay was better in the past, and so was the overall service, If you have no experience, or about to get fired at your current employer and very desperate for work, give it a shot. If you think that this is a career type of job its not unless you have 6 months left to live. ProsYou get paid weekly- check usually doesn't bounce. ConsRead the review... 4.0 Driver | Indianapolis, IN | Aug 25, 2018 Laid back environment to those that come in and do your job, home everyday-night linehaul, competitive with top 10-20 trucking companies Enjoy the laid back environment of being tour own boss in the sense of just coming in doing your job, running to wherever your route is, unloading your trailer when you get back and going home. Same thing 5 days a week. All terminals usually have their own set of rules regarding drivers within company standards like some have dock workers to unload, and some don't. Money is there and increasing with the driver shortages and is getting competitive with new raises and bonuses implemented here in 2018. Unlike some of these mega carriers and having 200+ drivers and being on the \"bottom of the totem pole\", most terminals have anywhere from 20-40 city drivers and maybe 10-20 road drivers. So when the driver shortage ever ends....maintaining your place in such a small rotation would be to your advantage as your place in moving up. I started 12th on linehaul and 2 years later i am 7th with 4 or 5 guys set to retire soon. I already make more money than those ups and fedex starters at almost $70k with this future cap putting me around $80k+ within 3 years. ProsHustling the system to find your niche in routes and pay, Always something you can do within your 14 hour max day ConsEquipment improving with purchases and fixing existing equipment, some days you find yourself fighting the trailers to shut doors or patching a hole in side 1.0 Dock Worker | Fort Worth, TX | Oct 28, 2016 Do Not be fooled by $17/hr This is the most unethical company I've been with. They will exploit you any way they can. The owner of the company owns the insurance company too. The premiums are much more than other companies I worked for. The communication is lacking in all areas there and you get 2-3 different answers to your questions. You're assigned a take home handheld scanner that you use to clock in/out yet there's no direct deposit. Not being paid for \"downtime\" is common unless you speak up. So if you're not being productive on the scanner (like start up meetings, inspecting your lift before mandated clock in, cleaning) you will be logged off and not paid unless you make them adjust it. They will try to make you think it's ok to work for free. Overtime starts after 55 hours and they're trying to get everyone down to 40 hours. The forklifts are total trash with rough wheels, forks don't raise fully, forks too short, etc. The forklift is the main tool yet they rather pressure employees to work faster than fix them. Stacking hazmat freight is normal here which is a major osha violation. I was told that one guy got splashed by sulphuric acid from falling buckets but he stacked some hazmat the next day. If you already have a job stay there because this place is the bottom and the pay is not worth it and if you don't use that time to find something else. ProsGoing home ConsLies and deceptive business, Filthy bathrooms and overflowing trash, Not paid for all time 1.0 Forklift Operator | Hillside, IL | Jul 26, 2019 Don\u2019t waste your time This was a short lived job! I applied and was advised to come into the location to complete a job application. I went to the location picked up the application and returned it the next day. That same day I was sent to complete a physical/ drug test. Which I passed! I was given a start date of July 9th for a part time position. I worked from July 9th through the 12th. I received a phone call from one of the managers \u201cBeau\u201d on Saturday July 13th asking if I could come in on my off day (Sunday) and work. I agreed to. He stated that he would have to contact corporate and get the approval for me to come in. Upon arriving on that Sunday I clocked in and was told by the supervisor that was on duty it was a \u201ctest\u201d to see who was reliable. I was told I could leave. When I returned to work the next day which was that Monday I was told that I had come in on a off day (Sunday) and had \u201cstolen company time\u201d. I was in shock because I was the one contacted to come in on my off day and was trying to make a good impression to show I was not only reliable but wanted my job. This company is VERY unprofessional and I see now why there is such a high turn overrate. Despite the pay rate of 17.00 plus an hour, they don\u2019t offer enough hours worth making the trip to go to work everyday. Don\u2019t waste your time going through the trouble of completing a \u201cpaper application \u201c and the hassle of completing a drug screen etc. Questions And Answers about Central Transport How are the working hours at Central Transport?
