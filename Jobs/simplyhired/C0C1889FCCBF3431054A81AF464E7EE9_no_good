OLA is a great place to work and grow professionally. A position at OLA provides experience with analytical thinking, evaluation of internal controls, and evaluation of compliance. It teaches you to work in a team environment and to continuously adapt to changes in management styles and working environments. As a Senior or Staff Auditor, your office is the work space at agency that you are auditing. Adapting to change and learning new information is part of the job. I would say that the hardest part of the job is that, as auditors, we must gain a detailed understanding of the responsibilities of agencies and agency personnel for every agency audited and we must thoroughly document our understanding. This detailed understanding is required in order to adequately evaluate compliance with rules, regulations, policy, laws, and proper internal controls. The most enjoyable part of the job is to become knowledgeable in so many areas. You find yourself understanding so much about how things work in government and in society. Also enjoyable is the excitement that comes from brainstorming with co-workers to develop creative ways to identify exceptions. 5.0 Food Runner | Miami Beach, FL | Oct 26, 2016 Beautiful atmosphere Enjoyed working with a renowned chef and a wonderful support staff.
