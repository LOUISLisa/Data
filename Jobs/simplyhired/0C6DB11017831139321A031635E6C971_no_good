I see different diagnoses day in and day out and have learned many things about health care, how the body reacts to certain diseases, and what it means to truly help someone. Each day, I endure many tasks including claims processing which entails comparing the acts of a medical condition to the wording within a specified group contract. I place many phone calls each day to claimants, physicians, and claimants employers to obtain additional medical documentation, employment responsibilities, wage information, accident details, etc to help in making the fairest decision possible for each claim received. I manage complex tasks such as researching medical conditions that may be considered work related as well as reading state laws in comparison to a claimants accident details to ensure that their claim does not fall within the contracts exclusions and limitations. Should a claim fall within these categories, I am responsible for writing and communicating each denial to the appropriate parties. Additional tasks include answering emails, participating in conference calls with claimants, employers, physicians, and coworkers. As well, certain additional tasks may be assigned each day, such as creating training modules for new hires, assisting coworkers with system issues, etc. Our management dept within Short Term Disability has b...more Prosgood benefits, 401k matching contributions, sick pay, holiday pay, and generous vacation time, flexibility to telecommute Consshort breaks, unavailable management 4.0 Business Analyst | Massachusetts | Sep 29, 2013 Business Analyst better understanding of the business and IT processes. \u2022 Responsible for analysis and functional specifications of As-Is and To-Be Business model to conduct GAP analysis in comparison to the proposed system to enhance the functionality of the application. \u2022 Gathered Business requirements through interviews, surveys and observing from account managers and conducted controlled brain-storming sessions with project focus groups and documented them in the Business requirement Document \u2022 Designed and developed project templates based on SDLC Methodology \u2022 Planned and defined system requirements to Use Cases, Use Case Scenarios and Use Case Narratives using the UML methodologies \u2022 Compiled financial, accounting, and economic data, developed investment guidelines, established comprehensive risk and asset allocation program for variable annuity subaccounts \u2022 Created Use Case Diagrams, Activity Diagrams, and Sequence Diagrams using MS Visio \u2022 Identify different types of users and analyze several important human engineering factors and guidelines and incorporated them into a design of a user interface using MS Visio \u2022 Managed and coordinated the QA team to create the test approach and determine test needs, test environment, test data, resources and limitations \u2022 Researched financial reports to support investment strategies of variable annuities separate accounts.

With a strong advocacy on work - life balance. A typical day at work starts at prospecting clients. Contacting them thru phone calls, text messages, e - mails and social media. After finalizing a meeting with a client, we meet at a place convinient for him. It may be a coffee shop, his office or his home. Sometimes we dine out or drink a few beers before closing out the deal with the client. I have learned to assess clients' needs before offering a specific proposal for his very own insurance policy. It is necessary to ask the client if he can afford such a policy and we should plan on checking if its enough to compensate the client and his family in the long run. The management is very supportive to us in terms of giving out trainings and invites motivational speakers to meetings in order to get us into the peak of our selling careers. My co - workers are also very supportive and does well in promoting positive reinforcements to work which includes their own selling techniques and prospecting techniques. The hardest part of the job is prospecting and meeting the client on a said schedule. Most of the time clients change their mind on the last minute before we even start the meeting but sales is a numbers game not all clients cancel at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the work - life balance. I make my own schedule and goes within my own pace even with deadlines and targets to be met. 1.0 Benefits Analyst | Portsmouth, NH | Sep 30, 2019 Depending on your manager, it can be enjoyable or miserable. Co-workers and claimants were most enjoyable to work with, as well as my first manager. The second manager suffered from Napoleon syndrome, and was intolerable. There was no reasoning to the rational of claims decisions under him. Having had vast prior experience in claims handling, as well as a NH adjuster licence, the work environment became a slippery slope. I had seen meritless claim approval, as the manager was afraid that it may be overturned on appeal, and hurt his groups rating. I was also told by this manager, that an employee needs to meet a certain average on the number of claim denials and approvals each month. This philosophy was unacceptable to my values. Claim decisions should be made on the facts of the case, not numbers the company wants to see...I had scored in the high 90's on a claim audit, and the manager actually work me up for mishandling the file. When he called to congratulate me on the audit score, I pointed out to him his negative remarks... He was blindsided and had no explanation. They have and will continue to lose talented and hard working employees with this narcissist as a manager. Upper management has no regard for employees, in fact, they retaliate if you have any complaints or constructive criticism, which is greatly needed within SLF. ProsGreat co-workers ConsTo many to list... 5.0 Sales Associate | Wellesley, MA | Mar 7, 2018 Good people, good management & good work environment. Get to work early set up workstation and check emails and pipeline. Grab some breakfast set up conference calls and manage all pipelines throughout the day. Talk sports with the guys and weekend plans. Go to lunch & after lunch continue to manage pipeline. Call reps and brokers as necessary and finish work at 5PM. I have learned how to manage 5 Reps and their workload. Learned how to use QPS system and various work tools. I also learned that I don't like an all day desk job. The management team is very good. My manager in particular is excellent with understanding people and knowledgeable about the work I do and always willing to help. The hardest part of the job is sitting at a desk all day and there is so much to learn sometimes information overload occurs. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with and the fellowship we have with each other. The guys really make work more enjoyable through talking and joking with each other but in a respectful manner. ProsExcellent vacation and benefits package ConsI never had a desk job. There is not enough activity during the day. 2.0 Customer Service Representative | Remote | Jan 3, 2018 Pays decently but stress is not worth it. Sun Life is in the process of settling down after an acquisition that took place 3/1/2016. They decided to take the best from the acquired company and from their company and are trying to blend them together. This has caused a lot of confusion. Communication in the company is not adequate. Decisions made seemed to lack forethought or big picture thinking. Loyal clients are not happy with the changes and are taking their business elsewhere. I was getting approx 100 emails a day and had to turn them around in 24 hours. Not enough people in my department. Slow to hire and make changes. My manager was terrible. Management said they wanted employees opinions before changes were made but seemingly did not take advice of the people most effected. Laid off people in what seemed like a very random way. Poor company ethos. Really enjoyed working with my colleagues and with other departments. ProsWork from home. Pay. Benefits ConsLack of direction from management. Internal communication.

The culture is relaxed but still results oriented, and there are many social events and activities to partake in. Some positions also offer workplace flexibility, allowing you to work from home if need be. In my personal experience the management was very accommodating, and coworkers are friendly and patient in showing you the ropes. A typical day at work usually includes a morning breakfast social and group meetings, which may come off as a bit tedious due to their frequency. But I learned a lot about the inner workings of healthcare and insurance certification, and enjoyed the freedom to add value by automating and streamlining the workflow of which I was put in charge. ProsHigh quality cafeteria, relaxed and open work culture, competent management Conslots of meetings 4.0 Claims Examiner | Hartford, CT | May 3, 2019 Like a second family but overworked Overall could be a great place to work but it is depending on your manager and your relationship to them. If you were liked your manager would have your back. A bit of favoritism which was obvious. You are overworked in many departments as the timelines are not defined properly. Training is adequate but could use an overhaul. They try to make it fun at times but most are to stressed to join the activities. Not a good place to work if you have personal struggles or a family. The best part is the lifelong friends you make. The salary is not bad and the benefits are very good for the industry. You start off with lots of PTO time but hard to take it during the peak summer season. They do offer work at home opportunities which was great. ProsPTO, Benefits, co-workers Conslack of management understanding, Old procedures for new systems, complacent upper management unwilling to change 3.0 Administrator | Wellesley, MA | Apr 11, 2013 Great experience, on the job training for advancement into other areas. A typical day at work - handled large volumes of disability claims, some very straight forward while at times some were more challenging. The hardest part of the job was not being able to send that disability payment out to the claimant due to barriers that may have prohibited payment immediately. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help the claimant received payment on their claim even if it meant staying all night on the phone with the medical, physical therapist or medical records depts/offices. Just being able to alleviate as much stress during the investigation process as possible. Hearing the joy over the phone when you're able to notify the claimant that their check is being sent via UPS of FedEx that day! Proscompany cookout, bonuses, service awards and gift cards.
