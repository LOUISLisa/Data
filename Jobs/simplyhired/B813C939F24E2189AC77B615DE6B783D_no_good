Serving different customers with different needs is the art of retail and that's also the hardest of the job. I enjoy working in a team where one can support the other but I work really productively under a minimum supervision environment. I love watching my co-worker serving customers especially the staff that worked there over a period of time, they understand customers needs that's when I learn several of how to become better at serving customers. The most enjoyable moments at work is the rewarding and satisfaction look of customers about our products. Consshort brakes, healthcare 4.0 English As A Second Language Teacher | Cary, NC | Dec 12, 2019 fun work and flexible to my own schedule its fun having different students every day and learning from one another. each kid has its own way of learning and it keeps me creative, and dynamic so that way i can get their atention and wanting to be part of the program. its also fun to learn from their culture (china) the hardest part of the job i would say its the time difference, sometimes i just feel so tired but i still wake up and do my job! 4.0 English As A Second Language Teacher | Brooklyn, NY | Feb 19, 2019 Online Company It pays the bills> Important to work along with the company and also be willing to communicate your grievances. Patience is a very important quality to have 4.0 Independent Contractor | China, ME | Jul 26, 2019 This is fun job somedays This job does not feel like a job and hours a awfully early. B y 9am I am done for the day Have the free time has been great. I adore the students they are so much fun. Most of the kids I work with are 3-10 year olds. I changed companies because Dada changed owner and they were having a lot of problems. 2.0 English As A Second Language Teacher | Tacoma, WA | Dec 28, 2018 Current situation with DADA Currently, there are big changes happening at DADA that has affected the jobs and positions of many contracted teachers and mentors. The requirements have been changed and now the company is asking for a lot of documents including criminal backgrounds and mandatory TESOL or ESL certifications. The mentors have been fired and pressure is at the top. The management is poorly handled and e-mails together with other communications are highly mishandled often. Send an email and you will never get a reply back. Technical issues are another issue and the TA and TI are slow in responding to problems. I am very disappointed as this is my first teaching online job. I have spent hours in the morning trying to do my job while all these changes are happening in the last minute putting pressure on teachers and other personnel. Very disorganized and unprofessional. ProsGood pay for a part-time job, students are adorable and willing to learn, the pay is often on time, working from home is convenient. ConsPoor management, requirements are not worth the time, too many requirements including criminal backgrounds. 5.0 English As A Second Language Teacher | Remote | Jun 2, 2020 Amazing Company Excellent supportive system and continuous training provided.

It has stolen our classes ! We paid for the classes and we worked hard to get extra classes as rewards and now DaDa has taken away all these classes ! We won\u2019t buy any more classes, this kind of cheating must be stopped, but the management doesn\u2019t care at all ! Most of users are now leaving DaDa and many teachers are losing their regular students. ConsYou don\u2019t want to work for it 3.0 English As A Second Language Teacher | Florida | Jul 24, 2019 Nice to work for I have been with Dada for almost 2 years, and in that 2 years, they have made constant changes, some improvement, others I can't agree with. But that is how companies operate. So far I'm okay with the changes, and love the kids. 1.0 English Teacher | Remote | Jul 24, 2019 Contract violations and stealing from teachers suddenly stopped scheduling classes (100% filled schedule went down to 50%) and removed contract hours for stand-by whereas stand-by was a guaranteed contractual feature. they pay only a fraction to teachers of what they charge students and still would do anything to pay even less and keep defrauding teachers out of money. 5.0 Assistant Manager | Maryville, MO | Apr 29, 2018 Growing Company Small town feel of a growing company. Still has opportunity to grow. It was a good place to work , better location now than before and nicer building. Questions And Answers about DaDa What is the interview process like at DADA?
