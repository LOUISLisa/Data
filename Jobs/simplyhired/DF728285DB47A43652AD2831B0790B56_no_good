I learnt how to make the customers happy and content, management very seldom spoke to us they snapped. My co-workers were just great we all got along and helped each other out when needed. The hardest part of the job was trying to make management happy. Tje most enjoyable part of the job was the thanks we got from customers who came and thanked us for making their stay enjoyable and easy. 3.0 Clerical Assistant | Jamaica, IA | Sep 14, 2015 Great Experience This was my 1st real job. This job helped me to become mature and responsible. I loved my coworkers. Learned alot about Tax Administration. 3.0 Resource Officer | Swansea, MA | Nov 15, 2018 Productive Potentially a productive working environment but under-resourced and underfunded with limited management engagement and lack of support for specialists and auditors 4.0 Customer Service Representative | Township of Hamilton, NJ | Sep 9, 2014 Average day in a call centre A typical day at work would be ensuring I am early for my shift as everything is very strictly time managed. After setting up my work space i start to take calls and assist customers with their queries. I have a great manager who provides me with the support i need. We set goals together to ensure i continue to strive and grow in the work place. I get along with the majority of my co-workers and often socialise out side of work time with them. The hardest part of my job is the verbal abuse i am faced with day to day. But i remember it is not personal, and i am there to serve the customer, assist them their frustrations and help them resolve their issues as easily as possible. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people have a great understanding of the system and seeing them finally grasp the concept of taxes and how they work. ProsHelping and teaching people ConsDisgruntled customers 5.0 Administrative Assistant | Jamaica, IA | Aug 16, 2015 Job is demanding, challenging, learn alot I know everywhere has its ups and down but this place is a nice place to work scope for development, managers very considerate, u get to meet alot of different type of people you actually feel at home when you go to work 3.0 Administrative Officer | Northeast, NY | Aug 24, 2016 great place if you have a young family while my daughter was young the flexible hours was ideal as you are able to leave if any emergencies happen. also you get family days if your child is ill and you don't have anyone to watch them. the pay is ok if your full-time its great. Prosflexi time Consboring work 4.0 Tax Assistant | Montego Bay, MD | Feb 26, 2017 filing job working in a government office was something else, even thou it was temporary employment, it was quite an experience, my responsibilities includes: filing documents sending out estimated assessment 3.0 Assistant Chief Financial Officer | Manchester, NH | Feb 12, 2018 ok if you like this kind of thing great if you like low pay flexi hours are nice and lots of different working patterns available. good for meeting people a large variety of different jobs 5.0 Assistant Chief Financial Officer | House, NM | Jan 14, 2013 A good place to work. It is my responsibility to review and reconcile customer's tax records, issue over and under payments and write to tax payers to explain their reconciliations. To do this I had to undertake three weeks training in which I studied a varied overview of personal tax. My job requires me to be thorough and confident in my knowledge of personal tax. As a government department we must work through the work management items that take priority on any particular week, this means that our work changes frequently requiring a flexible disposition. This also means that I am constantly learning new aspects of personal tax and also learning more thoroughly how to work the items on the computer systems. As assistant Officer I report to a line manager and attend nightly team meetings to discuss the team's overall productivity. Consunsociable hours 4.0 Senior Secretary | Kingston, NY | Oct 9, 2013 Great place to work. The company is very family oriented and the employees work great as a team Questions And Answers about HMRC What questions did they ask during your interview at HM Revenue & Customs?
