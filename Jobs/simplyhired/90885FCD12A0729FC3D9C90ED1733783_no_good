Unfortunately it was proving to not be a perfect fit for me in that it would have ultimately interfered with other things I have going on in my life. Additionally, the work itself may have been more physically demanding than what I am willing to take on at my age and I did not see myself ever being able to reach the productivity goal that was set for us individually. The quality of my work was never in question and mis-picks and short-losses were nonexistent. My scan percentage was also as high as it could be, given the distribution of my assignments, and I was always among the higher bracket in that area as well. I was repeatedly complimented on the quality level of my pallets in terms of stacking, weight distribution, and wrapping, by the loaders, other selectors, and management. I take quality and customer service extremely seriously and I believe my work there reflected exactly the kinds of principles that McLane demands we strive for toward our customers. That being said, the productivity goal was more important than anything else to management. They stress the service aspect because they have to, but at the end of the day, if you're not picking 170 cases or more per hour, nothing else really matters. As far as the topic of management is concerned, that is where the most work needs to happen, from my standpoint. As a selector, one is basically at the bottom rung of the proverbial ladder.

As soon you come in to work, you may work for 6-8-10-12-13 hours shift. Most likely you don't have weekends off, you days off will be during the week. After you work 12 hours and have to work the next day supervisors expect you to pick 100% of your job in 8 hours. There is not HR in this company, Manager and supervisor do what they want to do. They apply rules to whatever people when they want. You complain about safety, MBM won't do anything. They just don't care. Let's stretch, that's what the supervisor says every day after the meeting. 60 seconds stretch for a 2,000 times you have to bend your back in a complete shift. You back will totally kills you every day. You see people working overtime in their days off if they want, they walk in and work. Some another people don't.

Supervisor will send you again and again to help out freezer or cooler because you already know how to rock and roll in those places.They are a lot of people who say no to supervisor and supervisor are cool about it, they wont send them because they don't want, let's send someone else.

It does pay the bills and you will work for every penny you earn. However the business does not care about their employees, their only concern is the product. Prior to, the business was called Meadowbrook Meats (MBM) and it appears that the management from MBM is still in admin positions at McClane, which is bad news. No one knows what they are doing in the office and no one is consistent with anything they say. There have been instances where they could have cost some employees their actual CDL license for just running them to death and not actually keeping track of the hours previously worked. Not only is that dangerous and a liability but they do not care. DOT set forth new rules/regulations for a reason and here they are just running employees and product without keeping track of who worked how many hours and how long they have been home resting...very sloppy and messy and a great way to get the company shut down. Management was never on the same page, one would override the other leaving the employee confused as to what to do and who to listen to. They almost always have an attitude about something as well, just prepare yourself don\u2019t take it personal. There is clearly a need for administration/office employees to get some training on employee relations. When you start you are only paid 85% of the loads, so don\u2019t be surprised if they put a \u201ctrainee\u201d with you...and NO you don\u2019t get trainers pay for that.

The hardest part of the job was getting through a busy day. You have to select product up and down the aisles using either a double jack or a barret tugger and create pallets. The hours were long, the warehouse was extremely over crowded with pallets, product being lined up for loaders, people walking back and forth coupled with forklift operators and selectors going all over the place on powered equipment. It's a very unsafe enviroment. There was tons of unfair treatment by the the majority of supervisors in the dry grocery section. Full case candy section in general worked all day without breaks in order to finish the task. You have to pull average or you get canned. You have to select with not more than 3 mispicks per day which can also lead to termination. You have to deal with people taking equipment assigned to you and damaging it or leaving it in another department and not recharging it. The overall character of the supervisors and coworkers was severely lacking. The majority of supervisors didnt seem to care. The atmosphere seemed more juvenile and far from professional. Lots of profanity and unsavory conversations. Supervisors are known to play favorites. Coworkers in generally have a very selfish (me first) philosophy. The schedule is deceiving. Four 10 hour day schedules actually mean four 12 hour days. Five 8 hour days actually mean five 10 hour days. The schedule gets routinely changed two times a year.

The company has an innate desire to micro manage everything the employees are doing and seem to only want to nitpick about what they think will improve production and donot want to listen to more experienced individuals who have been around and have already tried those same attempts . the departments show extreme favoritism to the point where they will lie about what actually happened to cover for a favorite in there department but if you have no such status you will be written up for sneezing in the wrong place and when you bring up these inequalities in discussion upper management treats you like you are a troublemaker and its your fault that other teammates will not work with you . the review process is a joke at the end of the year when someone who couldn't possibly do your job tells you with a straight face that you don't know enough about what you are doing and dings you for it and when you ask for examples of such things they cannot do so . nor do they appreciate when you go out of your way to get something done that your teammates have not been able to do for days they don't even say thank you for getting that ...more Prosthey have decent events /appreciation and decent benefits and pay scales are alright for area Consthey will treat you like a leper if you arent part of the \"Click\" and force you out. 4.0 Order Picker | Baldwinsville, NY | Aug 8, 2015 Fun work place where you can interact and joke around with people while getting the job done Well my work day starts at 3am, although my particular job is very physically demanding that is one of the hardest things about my position. My job title is palletizer which means I handle a fair amount of product in my department. The pickers will scan a barcode on each tote and put the correct product in the tote then either pass it to the next person or if that particular tote is complete then they send it down the line. This is where my position comes in, I scan the label on the front of eace tote printed out by the selector. Then my scanner will tell me which pallet each tote goes to which then gets placed on the correct pallet. Relatively easy the hard part about my job is the lifting, I work on the heaviest floor and there is no weight limit any tote needs to stay under as long as the product fits. On average I lift between 55,000 and 65,000lbs a day and handle 1,300-1,5000 totes. When the pallet is complete I will rap it with tape to secure he totes do not move as some of them are over 6 feet high. Then using an electric pallet jack I move the complete pallet to a designated area to be taken to the correct trailer so it can be loaded. If there is no more room I will take the pallet to the trailer. That is my main job however, when I am not busy there is always something to do. Some of the other tasks are to replenish the tots the pickers use which require an electric pallet jack or a stand up forklift. Also help the stockers cut and put product in the correct bay so ...more ProsCompany paid lunches throughout the year as well as safety rewards Cons3 am start time for my position. 3.0 Center Manager | Battleboro, NC | Sep 21, 2017 DC Supervisor The job never did get boring. I was given the opportunity to supervise 3 different departments in a one year period. The teammates were mostly nice, despite being overworked. The job wasn't too hard, dangerous, but the hours were exceedingly long and stress was, at times, horrendous. We were going through many, needed, management changes, and there were several areas that had ZERO accountability and little, to no supervision... Namely Maintenance and Information Systems. Maintenance were completely disorganized, with no clear leadership. Fork operators would often have to wait 30 mins to an hour to get a battery changed. IS was even worse. Cycle counts on inventory were not being done, except for Cigarettes. This caused inventory nightmares. Lost or \"ghost\" pallets were everywhere, resulting in lost sales, expired product, and increased stressed, because i would often have to \"hunt for them.\" The pay was fair, but not good. My dept performed better than all others, on a regular basis. However, bonuses were 3.5% of a potential of 15.5% due to the overall poor performance. I feel that working 60 or more hours, extra days, with many times skeleton crews, would justify Supervisors getting at least 10% of that bonus. Upper management did not listen well and discouraged any dissenting opinions. They also did not bare adequate amount of responsibility for our failures or shortcomings. They were in meetings from 3-5 hours per day and would decisions with out discussing them with s...more Prosfree meals, 401k match ConsLONG hours, unpredictable volume, incompetent managers. 3.0 Truck Driver | Merced, CA | Nov 14, 2014 Driving was the easy part. Hard, physical work unloading your truck. Great pay, but earned every penny of it through sweat and hard work. Drove and delivered with a partner - shifts were typically 20-24 hrs long and did 3 of those each week. I hear the routes have changed a lot recently for the drivers, since now that the company has decided to follow the laws. Almost all shifts were driven in northern California, so a typical day would be, get to yard at 5 pm, drive 2 hours to Bay area then start delivering to 18-24 stops for the next 20 hours. Get home the next day at 2 pm and then sleep. You might have to be back to work at 11 pm that same night. Stops were places like 7-11s, Targets, mom & pop stores, Rite Aid, Walgreen's. Each stop we'd pull the ramp and hand-truck in the totes and product - about 12 times up and down that ramp, then repeat that at least 20 times that night. 30,000 lbs., all moved by hand by two guys with hand-trucks. In all weather. Really sucked when the load wasn't put in to the truck in the correct sequence of the delivery. Many times had to move many stacks of product out of the way for 3-4 stops, because the stuff loaded last at the door was for the 4th delivery. Dispatch was less than helpful - they really didn't care much about us out there. Equipment was pretty well maintained. Got to have customer service skills because you deal with them at each stop. If products are wrong, you are the one that has to fix it. And don't get sick - you can't miss any shifts. You get write ups, even if you have a doctor's note.

Once they leave management just fills the role with whomever they like most. Example, the Transportation Manager knew nothing about trucks, drivers, or deliveries. They just liked him in his role as warehouse manager. Another person was a good secretary and got promoted to payroll, and let's just say drivers were often short on their checks. Same thing happened in HR and in the warehouse. But if you like dysfunctional management where it is acceptable to yell at your staff, then this is the place for you. Also, if you like not being supported in any decision, then you will love it here. I often saw employees do whatever they wanted and have no repercussions. Once saw warehouse staff looting bags of candy and nothing was done. Once had employees not complete safety reviews and nothing happened. Once had an employee break several rules recommend a write up and it never came. They require you to work 50+ hours a week, and even try to bring you in nights and weekends. Lastly, everything runs behind schedule. Warehouse experience delays every other day, and trailers get delayed almost daily. Try convincing a guy who has an 18 hour route that his route won't start for another 2 hours and will now take 20. And yes they actually have 18, 20, and 22 hour routes. I once dispatched 2 driver at 5 pm and didn't see them return until the next day at 4pm.
