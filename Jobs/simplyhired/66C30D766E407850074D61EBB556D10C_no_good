I have worked for the company for about 14 months now. The first couple of months were fine, I really enjoyed it mainly because we was at another store doing our training while the new store was being built in our town. After 3 months at this other store, we moved in to our brand new store where everything changed. The managers attitude changed entirely and started to treat people like slaves. They handed out counsellings (written version of a telling off) like sweets for the smallest reasons. Expected staff members to work constantly extra shifts without getting paid for it, then made out \"that was your duty as part of the team\" Favouritism existed on a daily bases, in total including myself we had 10 staff members, of those, 2 of them were constantly chosen to go on all the training courses that became available, got first choice of any over time that became available and always were allowed to do what they want, or didn't want to do. The rest of us didn't even get a look in. I have recently just received my second investigation and also had lots of written and verbal warnings in the past for bogus allegations. Two of which the area manager got removed off my file because he agreed they were laughable. The way they carry out their investigations are a shambles, they bring up incidents that happened 14 months ago, get dates wrong, venues where the incident allegedly took place wrong, the incident itself wrong, and convince themselves that is a case to answer.

I tried my hardest to make a difference, but in a big company it was impossible. The animals are kept in tiny, cramped conditions on the shop floor but out back it\u2019s 10 times worse and I dread to think where they are bred. Management and higher up DO NOT care about the welfare of the animals, you are forced to sell animals to live in tiny cages because they say they\u2019re suitable. The animals are often sick and have life long conditions which are not treated. Rabbits are the worst... kept in tiny cages with a litter of 6 or more! A lot of the time they would fight and cause serious injuries to one another. You was not allowed to refuse a rabbit to live on its own and even if it was going to be used for breeding! I took rabbits home to syringe feed them to keep them alive as they came in so skinny and lifeless, I even had them die in my arms. I could write forever about how awful the place is. Animals are treated as items and so easily accessible. Awful company! ProsNon ConsEverything 5.0 Grooming Assistant | Macclesfield, NC | Jun 4, 2019 Good I enjoyed working for pets at home. i didnt work there long but thoroughly enjoyed my time there. staff were lovely, management were lovely, all round a good place. 2.0 Stylist | Lon, MO | Dec 7, 2017 Don't waste your time They sell dreams when you first start , the rare training is good . The management is awful ! If your face doesn't fit you will be victimised. Pets before profit is often compromised due to the conditions you are forced to work in. Only thing good about working here is the training but again that is rare ProsTraining ConsBad management 5.0 Pet Groomer | England, AR | May 15, 2020 An okay company A good company with nice amount of benefits, management is okay, pay is okay, a good job for in between if at college or university. Nice amount of holiday pay which increases over time within the company ProsGood management ConsLong hours on your feet 5.0 Pet Sitter | Fortson, GA | Feb 8, 2017 Great Job with flexible hours This was a great job to have when I was enrolled full time in school. I was able to apply my knowledge of biology in the animal field. I provided personalized pet care to clients in and around the Columbus area. 4.0 Sales Associate | Suffolk, VA | Aug 16, 2018 Animals to cuddle Loads of fun working with the animals , very hard physical workload, advancement easily achieved, fun staff and great management in store, not.

Also location and store management teams hugely impact access to training and advancement. ProsGood training available although hard to access in some regions.
