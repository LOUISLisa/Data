Therefore, you will be exposed to harassment and poor management. No job security, case over load and no help when needed. There's a culture that has been ongoing since the agency was developed. ProsIs supposed to support families in Ct. ConsHas a wait list much to long because of staff gets to choose who they want to work with. 1.0 Family Advocate | Wethersfield, CT | Oct 23, 2017 Management Skills Poor Management Skills and two much micro management, very discriminating agency against there employee. It was a great experience being at my sub contract then they started not liking me. but I loved my job and clients. 5.0 Delivery Person | Mesquite, TX | Aug 22, 2018 Love this for a side job If you are looking for a side hustle that will take you to luxurious places and keep you busy, this is definitely a job for you. It will keep you busy all day if you wish which I like. 5.0 Systems Project Manager | Wethersfield, CT | Jan 18, 2018 Doing your best and Being your best Days are subject to change, meetings cancelled or added to your calendar. You make a commitment to projects and the process of supporting partners in the region. You serve families in non traditional means such as meeting them, planning workshops and training beyond the tradition 9-5 p.m. time frame. To do \"What\" you do, one must first understand \"Why\" you do it. This work is of passion and must look beyond the agenda and find commonality in doing the work. Discipline is needed to guide and balance one self in the field, and integrity led with honesty is a must because families count on having a voice until they have a voice. This means as a Systems Manager you will speak on behalf and you will speak in introductory form to incorporate that family voice. Organizational skills is a MUST! prioritizing meetings and commitments one must use best judgement. See value in your FSM team and Program Director, it is a rich experience. ProsCommunity connections and Family expertise ConsFunding to support the work 3.0 Courier | San Antonio, TX | Sep 3, 2019 Hit or miss? A constant question. Hardest parts of the job are communication between both you and the customer as well as you and support, competitiveness of shifts, and what you earn versus how much it costs to earn it. I believe if you live where you can deliver on a bike or happen to have an incredibly fuel efficient car, as I do not, you'll do alright. Typical day of work depends on if you were able to land a shift. On an actual shift you are guaranteed at least one order, whereas working on your own is just a waiting game most of the time. Most enjoyable part of the job is all the different people you get to interact with, and all the places you visit that you didn't even know existed that you can plan to go try when you're not working. You meet management at orientation. Very nice people who make the process painless and quick. I was on the job straight out of orientation. ProsMaking your own schedule. ConsCommunication, cost vs earnings 5.0 Driver (Independent Contractor) | Lubbock, TX | Feb 15, 2020 Review I love the independence and freedom. And I would highly recommend this and would give her a referral. It definitely gives back to the community along with the sense of feeling and purpose. 4.0 Independent Contractor | Dallas, TX | Feb 12, 2020 You must be self-motivated and competitive to succeed You set your own schedule and if you're good at what you do you can succeed. This a delivery service, so you spend a lot of money on gas, plus wear and tear on your car. 1.0 Delivery Driver | Dallas, TX | Jan 21, 2018 I feel sorry for those who work for this company. I never worked for this company. I just went to the orientation and never accepted the job because of the pay $2.5 a delivery not knowing how much time is spent per delivery. It does not seem to be getting any pay at all. Compare to Uber and Lyft it's way less. I believe it should be the delivery person who do the work and should get pay more, not the other way around. ProsThere are other delivery job that pay more. ConsAfter all those payments, Does it profit after paid for gas, wear & tear of car? 4.0 Personal Assistant | Dallas, TX | Aug 18, 2018 Like you work when you want Get on schedule for gurantee hourly pay . Good way to Earn extra money on your time . Be your own boss. If you want to plan a vacation and need extra spending cash this would be a great way to earn it ProsSelf employed ConsNo benefits 3.0 Personal Assistant | Houston, TX | Jun 20, 2018 A better side job, but not career. It is fairly basic in understanding the procedures, but key to doing well is great communication with the clients. You're considered an independent contractor, and they(Favor) don't do as much as they should to help you succeed in understanding all the in and outs of what that means, probably due to legal issues. The pay is very dependent on the customer. ProsVery flexible schedule that you can control ConsCan be costly in maintaining car, and the pay Questions And Answers about Favor How would you describe the pace of work at Favor? Asked Jan 28, 2018 Here I saw peoples are honest and very hardwor Answered Apr 8, 2020 It\u2019s an okay piggy bank job, if you have plenty of GASOLINE MONEY! Because I feel the wear and tear and gas spending out weighs the earnings! If the runs are in same area and vicinities.... etc its a be better balanced. Once I had To drive to a sonic from well over 10 miles to deliver a large drink into an apt complex a few miles a way! You never know where your going and it\u2019s usually all over the place but only delivering a few runs! There\u2019s money but not to count on. Almost like babysitting money, good for teenagers! Answered Apr 24, 2019 Are there any up front costs to start driving? Asked Aug 9, 2017 46 dollars Answered Dec 20, 2019 No, buying their merchandise is purely optional. As for the insulated bag, HEB sells decent ones for under $5. Answered Jul 14, 2019 What is the interview process like at Favor? Asked Jan 28, 2020 Online application. Then got an email saying to pick your time & day to attend a group orientation. Attend orientation which is also your training w slides and an instructor. By the end of orientation, which takes 1 hour the background check will be complete and those who pass can start driving the same day Answered May 6, 2020 No interview! Apply and a text to attend orientation will be sent. Schedule your orientation and attend to learn all about favor and the app and how to run favors. Approve a background and SMV check and you may start the same day in some cases. Answered Apr 29, 2020 Do favor runners pay for the food or items for the customer beforehand or is it all paid & processed through the app? Asked Feb 15, 2017 Yes pay ahead with company card Answered Dec 31, 2018 I typically use the company card to pay for the items requested for the clients only and record them for the company, client and myself. and the client will apply payment to the request after the favor is complete. Answered May 28, 2018 Are you earning a wage or per delivery and tips.What is the average amount of money can you make? Asked Sep 8, 2016 You get a minimum of $2.10 per Favor, sometimes slightly more, and you get a minimum of $2.00 tip per Favor. So you'll make at least $4.10 for each Favor but if the customer tips more, you keep 100% of the tip. If you're going at a good pace, you can do about 1.5 Favors per hour. Consider an 8 hour day if you want to compare it to any other full time job. That's about 12 Favors at minimum of $4.10 per or $49.20 which gives you your minimum of about $6.15/hour. Because most people do tip more than $2.00, in reality, you'll probably average $10-12/hour. Most weekends have promotions where you can make a little better on the weekends but that would be a good number to work with if you're trying to decide if you'd like to drive or not. Answered Feb 18, 2019 You get $2.10 per hour, assuming a favor takes you an hour and you receive no tips. Favor will tack on a five dollar tip to make up for that laughable amount of money they pay you, so $7 per hour, again assuming it takes you an hour to run a favor. Answered Oct 20, 2018"
