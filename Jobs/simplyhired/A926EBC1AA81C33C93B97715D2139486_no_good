Falls, TXWilmington, DEWilmington, NC Overall Reviews at Collabera 3.0 Anti Money Laundering Analyst | Tampa, FL | Sep 6, 2018 Save yourself the headache. Excessive phone calls/emails: From the outset, the recruiters would call multiple times a day. In the interviewing/onboarding phase, I would receive multiple phone calls on the same day often times from different people all inquiring about the same thing. When checking my references, two different recruiters called me on the same date asking for alternate contact information for an employer from seven years ago. For a different reference, various recruiters called the person a total of five times during the workday, after I'd advised them that the reference requested to be contacted at the end of her workday, since she runs a non-profit. To make matters worse, she was subsequently contacted to provide the reference a second time, the day after she initially provided it. When she called me to advise that she'd provided the reference, she stated one hand didn't seem to know what the other hand was doing. Payroll problems: They are very adamant about employees adhering to timesheet deadlines, in order to avoid payroll delays. However, when their payroll department makes an error, they act as if their hands are tied and they can't fix the problem. For example: their payroll department incorrectly entered an entire week's worth of pay incorrectly in their system. While they acknowledged that they made the error, I was told that since payroll had closed the only option was to wait until the following pay period to get paid that money. When I objected stating that it's both...more ProsProvides accurate descriptions of job responsibilities. ConsPayroll problems, excessive contact, customer service needs improvement, low pay 1.0 Senior Consultant | San Diego, CA | Aug 24, 2019 Collabera is a useless contract house Like many of the other contract houses, Collabera has unskilled recruiters contacting resources that have posted their resumes on job boards. They try to find resources with the skillsets that match their client's resource requirements. The unskilled recruiters are just that -- they perform resumes searches that try to match key words from their client's personnel requisitions and then submit resumes to their clients for consideration. Collabera arranges the interviews and the hiring process as a contractor, but that is about it. It is only a limited duration contract assignment with the client within which you work entirely embedded with the client as a contractor (i.e., augmented workforce member). The only additional interface that you have with Collabera is entering your timecard into their payroll system each week and hoping that the appropriate amounts are reflected on your paycheck. Other than that, there is no interaction whatsoever with Collabera. Collabera offers benefits, but they are outrageously priced and Collabera does not contribute to the employee's premiums nor co-pays. Contractors are better off finding benefits on their own. There is no advancement nor career opportunities available. There is only your current assignment for as long as the current client engagement lasts. 1.0 Software Engineer | New York, NY | Feb 11, 2015 Beware : Contractors are Bonded Labourers - H1B employees : Avoid this company Well they start your process by saying we do not charge visa fees etc and there is no contract. But they give you offer letter which has so many terms and conditions : 1. You cannot leave company within 18 months else you pay them a penalty of about 8000$ 2. You have to give 4 weeks notice to their clients else you pay penalty again - In US the norm is to give 1-2 weeks of notice. So now you know you cannot leave them ever since no one in US waits for 4 weeks for your notice to get over. 3. Appraisals in 1 year are pathetic 4. Health policy is awful 5. They will pay you very less 60K while a 8+ years experience gets easily 100K in US (after employers cut) . So you know you are at complete loss..... This is equivalent to Bonded Labour : \"A person becomes a bonded labourer when their labour is demanded as a means of repayment for a loan. The person is then tricked or trapped into working for very little or no pay. The value of their work becomes invariably greater than the original sum of money borrowed.\" Avoid them, there are companies which file visa for free and have reasonable terms and conditions. Just search them and apply to everyone and negotiate your rates. Collabera is arrogant and will not negotiate anything. ProsHave big client base. ConsAgreement/Bond, less pay, nothing in the name of appraisals. 4.0 Purchaser | Denison, TX | Oct 5, 2016 Temporary Agency with good placement options With Collabera, I worked at CAT in Denison, TX. I enjoyed my position while working there because I knew exactly what my job requirements were and had the knowledge to achieve my duties. I appreciated that the management team gave me direction and tools, and allowed me to come up with my own techniques/processes to complete the task at hand. My co-workers and I were very successful at dividing the workload and completing the tasks that were assigned to us. We actually completed our project 6 months earlier than expected. This was partially due to the reports that I created to show and changes within the system on a daily basis. This report prevented duplicate efforts since there were several departments working on the same project. The hardest part of the job was when a supplier didn't respond at all to a request that was sent to them. To tackle this obstacle, emails were sent with follow up reminders. If we continued to receive no response, the supplier's lack of response was escalated to the management team for further action. I truly enjoyed working with a fun group of people at CAT. The most enjoyable part of the job was creating a rapport with the suppliers and being able to reach and surpass goal expectations. ProsRecognition for job excellence ConsNo healthcare benefits 1.0 Project Manager | Georgia | Apr 20, 2019 I felt \"ghosted\". In spite of all the different people that call and the subcontracted entities involved with the on boarding, background check, etc., they just do not have it together. Two weeks were wasted getting my past work history checked since \"outsourced staff\" made mistakes reading the past employers provided. Assignment zip code and address (even though I advised from local experience it couldn't be right) were incorrect so I had to wait weeks for a secured entrance card to the correct location and in the meantime, be let in/out like a child by co-workers. My assignment contact disappeared for weeks at a time while I tried to communicate issues with the client's funding and project assignment availability. NOT a SINGLE person in HQ management I called and emailed near the end of my assignment acknowledged my attempts to reach them. So called placement staff call every few months but don't even name applicable job assignments I have seen myself online. No one ever even connected me to or made me aware of staff in my own city. It's as if it's a \"pretend\" company. ProsCOBRA benefits price ConsToo many outsourced or MIA contacts. 3.0 Data Entry Clerk | Greensboro, NC | Oct 28, 2013 Data Entry Clerk Upon starting, pulled faxes to be stapled and separated according to who they were addressed to. Counted faxes and distributed them to co-workers. Had to go into system to pull requests for letters that needed sent out such as letters of intent, paid in full letters, and one and the same letters. I also had to put \"vector numbers\" on faxes(mail) that didn't have our standard loan number to be handed out to the lien release associates who produced the lien releases for paid mortgages. Had to get loan information in order to do the letters for the third parties or associates in the bank. Once this information was obtained I composed the letters with the borrowers name, address, date mortgage was paid and satisfied and either faxed them or mailed them per request instructions. I did between 30-50 letters per day and pulled faxes at least 3 times a day to distribute. Faxes ranged from 50-100 or more per day. This was done consistently throughout the workday and completed each and everyday. ProsLearning new skills and seeing how the lien release department worked. ConsWanting to do more and not given the opportunity to shine. 4.0 Accounts Assistant | Morristown, NJ | Oct 29, 2018 Collabera is a temp agency that placed me is a nice challenging assignment. The assignment was monitoring 16 printers that printed sensitive material for mortgage companies. A typical day consisted of keeping a watchful eye on printers so they were constantly printing. I had a great trainer who was generous with information and taught me a lot about maintaining the machines, replacing parts and trouble shooting. The most enjoyable part of the assignment was monitoring each printer. The most valuable part of the assignment was a teachable moment which afforded me an opportunity to learn something new that helped me do minor repairs. The supervisor and manager were very nice and supportive and knowledgeable about the job. The tech was trained to handle major repairs. The hardest part was lifting boxes of paper all day but it was manageable and a good workout. This was an ideal job for me and I thank Collabera for the assignment. ProsChallenging job which was never boring and was a great learning experience ConsBeing by myself when a major repair was required and I had to take the machine offline. 5.0 Controls Engineer | Wichita Falls, TX | May 20, 2014 already reviewed already reviewed already reviewedContracted to AT&T. Used a battery of tests to determine health of fiber to copper circuits with technicians in the field, providing approval to move on to next job with a healthy circuit, or advise technician about trouble on the line and send them back to complete repairs. Used 4 separate drafting / autocad programs to determine circuit length for rate and reach for U-verse services both IPDSL and VDSL and advised on appropriate profiles based on loop length and speed allocations. Enforce methods and procedures in the field in order to positively increase customer satisfaction with U-verse services. Reduce unnecessary outside tech dispatches by testing with techs in the field and isolating where trouble is if any, thereby saving the company money while getting their issue fixed in one trip. Used Chat based communications to speak with techs about the necessity of bonding circuits in order to provide service at lengths not capable on a single circuit. Educate Techs on how to properly read testing. 4.0 Quality Assurance Tester | Wilmington, DE | May 29, 2018 Both Good Companies to Work For Collabera got back to me about an hour after I applied for a position they had advertised. After speaking with them they submitted my info to JPMC and within a day they had scheduled an interview. The interview went well and by the end of the week I was offered the job. It was supposed to be contract-to-hire but from day one all of the contractors were told that there were not any permanent positions to be hired for. Working at JPMC was very interesting. The various client websites and social media outlets that we were using made things different every day. There were only 3 employees in the department and the rest were contractors. Surprisingly, everyone worked well together. There is very little parking available in the area and what is available is very expensive. There is off-site parking with shuttle service but it's for employees only. ProsConvenient location, Interesting work, Helpful people, Contractors included in team/company gatherings, on-site cafeteria and cafes ConsExpensive parking, Contract-to-hire wasn't true 2.0 Customer Service Representative | Rochester, NY | Sep 28, 2014 AT&T Contract The only complaint I have about Collabera is the language barrier. It is hard to understand their employees. My complaint is more about the vendor ACC Business, which is a separate entity of AT&T. During snow days, you have to make the time up and still end up short on your hours. Never heard of a telecom company not wanting a bill payment system for the convenience of the customer. The excuse is that it makes the company \"unique\". No overtime pay if you get stuck on a long call just before the end of your shift and you can't advise the customer you need to get off the phone or disconnect the call. A lot of throwing your co workers under the bus instead of a team atmosphere. The trainer has no telecom experience and is unable to answer questions. The training base is not updated. She spends all her time planning parties and other non essential things that are not work related. The monthly meetings are a waste of time and geared more towards sales. Pros60 minute lunch ConsNo overtime pay, lots of backstabbing and tattle telling, insuffic Questions And Answers about Collabera How long does it take to get hired from start to finish at Collabera?

No one was allowed to talk to each other, and if you even spoke to your co workers for more than 2 minutes the boss would micromanage you and tell you to get to work.
