Management are a bunch of old dinasours and highly biased towards anyone who is from Quebec or having a French sounding name will do, if you're not French. After many years on the job, my role ended, which is fine, but I had to fight to get a severance package and references. Left a very sour taste in my mouth about this company, where I'd had excellent performance and reviews and always went above and beyond the call of duty according to my supervisor. So, if you are French, you will likely do well there with minimal effort. Otherwise, good luck!
