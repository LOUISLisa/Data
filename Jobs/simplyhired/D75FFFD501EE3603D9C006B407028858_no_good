Hills, CA Overall Reviews at Charles Schwab 2.0 Senior Relationship Banker | Orlando, FL | Sep 24, 2012 Horrible Company to Work For There is no consistency in management. If you have a bad manager, you might as well quit now, because you'll have a hard time getting out of the position you are currently in. Schwab freely admits that their compensation is below the market. Their benefits are awesome, and that is about the best thing I can say about them. Promotions are pooled, so there may only be one or two available to a group of 50 employees or so. If you don't get the promotion, about the only pay increase they will give you is the 2% COLA. Bonuses are pooled as well, and it is up to each manager to fight for a larger slice of the pie for their employees. Again, if you have a bad manager, your bonus will be next to nothing. And your manager will tell you there was nothing they could do about it. If you happen to do well, and earn the Key Contributor award, then you'll get a bonus - stock options and restricted stock - that it takes YEARS to actually get. Gee, you did a great job. Now you have to stay another three years to get what you've earned. As a \"Relationship Specialist,\" you are put in a training class that teaches you little more than there is an exception to everything, and every team does the same procedure differently. You're supposed to go above and beyond to service the client (advisor) but inevitably the answer is no, we can't do that. Once training is complete, the expectation is that you've learned all you need to know to do your job. Not by a long shot. Policy is vague, and in some c...more Prosbenefits package Consjust about everything else 3.0 Service Associate | Richfield, OH | Oct 23, 2019 Not what they seem... In the beginning, Charles Schwab was a wonderful culture and seemed like a great place to work. However, the stipulation that requires you to pass the FINRA SIE, Series 7 and Series 66 exams are extremely difficult. I was able to pass the SIE with my first attempt, but was unable to pass my Series 7 exam after two attempts (I got a 68% and 65% on my attempts and you need a 72% to pass). After I failed the series 7 the first time, the entire atmosphere changed at work. My managers were no longer offering help, my co-workers looked at my fellow new hires (who also failed their first attempt, 4 of us failed out of 5) and me as if we were complete morons. Everything that gave me a positive vibe before the exams instantly changed after that first failed attempt. Also, the job itself is taking high volume phone calls about participant 401k accounts, so they have specific metrics that you have to be within. For example, they don't want any one phone call to take more than an average of 10 minutes, but when it takes 3-5 minutes to get someone verified and then get them logged into their account, that 10 minute window came up quick! All it took was one elderly person who needed 25 minutes of help signing into their account and your performance for the day was trashed. My manager had told me time and again that I shouldn't worry about my metrics and focus on the exam material and studying. The only issue I had on the phones were my calls taking a little more than 10 minutes on average....more ProsNice Cafeteria and Building ConsHigh pressure, High stress, Statistic/Exam requirements 5.0 Senior Compliance Officer | San Francisco, CA | Jul 1, 2013 Schwab was the best firm I've worked for. I have worked in the financial services industry since 1984 and Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. was the best/my favorite employer so far. I don't know what the culture is like now, but I worked there in the mid 90's through 2005. The company's culture was great in the 90's. They are very client focused and do right by their customers. One of the things I loved about Schwab is that they were generous to employees at all levels, not just executive level employees - as far as stock option grants etc. If you were a hard worker, it paid off. There was a lot of opportunities there at that time because the firm was going through a growth spurt. At some point, the focus of the firm seemed to shift slightly (when Charles Schwab stepped down to Dave Pottruck) after acquiring US Trust, increasing client service fees and generally upsetting some of the smaller client base. But for the most part, the company treated employees well and offered good benefit package etc. - having left and worked for other firms after my time at Schwab, I look back on my time there and wish I hadn't left! They also offered a great \"sabbatical\" program to employees. After 5 years of service, employees were eligible to take a 30-day, fully paid sabbatical, this was in addition to and separate from vacation time. This allowed overworked staff some well deserved and much needed down time during the 90's when the markets were crazy. I had 2 sabbaticals while working for Schwab. That's a very generous benefit that I've...more ProsOpportunities, sabbatical program, stock option grants, good company culture, client focused, good to their employees ConsVery busy place, too many layers of management 4.0 Client Services Specialist | Berkeley, CA | Nov 20, 2012 Good place to start I commute via BART and arrive about 45 minutes early. I open the safe, print clients' checks for the day and open the branch. I assist clients at the front desk with check and stock certificate deposits and operational problems as well as financial consultants with any problems they have, ie. submitting paperwork, compiling information, or any other miscellaneous tasks. I talk with clients and prospects about Schwab products, looking for sales opportunities. If there is a financial workshop scheduled for the day, I may present myself or coordinate another presenter. At the end of day, I print reports of the day's activities and close the branch. I have added to my knowledge of the financial industry, sales process, and customer service techniques, as well as working as a team with very different individuals. We have had some changes in management which have caused some adjustments. The financial consultants all keep to themselves and work in their individual offices, except when they have the occasional question. The support staff, myself included, leverage each other often and work well to meet clients' needs. The hardest part of my job is probably the compensation and the staffing. Rather than being awarded based on our own performance, the support staff's bonus is contingent on how the company performs overall, unlike the consultant bonus plan which compensates them on multiple factors. We have had staffing problems since before I started which can be problematic for cli...more Prosoccasional free lunch, opportunities to learn Consnot many holidays, staffing 4.0 Senior Administrator | El Paso, TX | Aug 22, 2017 Standard Operations Center A typical day involved dealing with new account requests submitted via application or online that had errors of which could not be automatically handled. I was involved in the review team that would assist with this issues and help to overcome the obstacles. This could be as basic as reviewing a smudged number, to calling a local branch or client, or even involving third-parties (client's attorneys and lawyers) when required. The work seems very overwhelming when you first step in, but over time you will develop the means to handle the tasks. Management ensures that you are never thrown to the wolves, but will make sure that you are challenged and that you challenge yourself. I worked with a team of 15 others and was one of the more seasoned representatives on the team, which meant people would come to me for support and assistance. This is very much a team environment, where you never have to work alone. If you ever need help, there is always someone there to guide you. The culture at where I worked was developing, slowly but surely. As more people are hired, it will expand and develop even faster. Management has made a significant improvement over the last year I worked their, and morale has seen a boost due to this. The hardest part about my job was that each day will always bring a new challenge, and you never know what that might entail. Clients can be difficult to deal with when it comes to complicated situations, but that comes with every job. At the end...more ProsWork Hours, Overtime Availability, Health Benefits ConsHiring Process 3.0 Brand Manager | San Francisco, CA | Nov 30, 2017 Overall assestment of working at Schwab headquarters This is a solid and safe place to work. I was fortunate enough to work on the one team that was fun and lively with the most personality. Since most the employees here are 40 yrs old and older you can tell that their team cultures are quiet and dull in comparison. It's a very head down with your headphones environment that doesn't breed excitement. As a company if you want to learn and take on more work to help expand your experience and knowledge they are great at doing so. but, when it comes to advancement this is not the place you want to be. It's a complacent place to be. Because there is very little types of levels (manager, Senior, Director, SVP and above) most people are Senior level, but have remained so for many years. While the company is eager to think with innovation as often as possible it is also a company/industry that is very slow moving and projects and ideas need to be voted by large majorities which can take a project that requires 2 months from start to finish, to taking a year to complete. Also, compared to competitors Schwab is the lost paying by a good $15k per salary.Overall, if you are a working parent this is a great company that has solid ground and an easy going culture that allows flexibility to balance your personal life. Most people leave the office and don't check their emails after 5pm, nor the weekends. That actually is great in the sense where you can disengage immediately. Good company, but not if you are an achiever that wants to do and b...more ProsWork life balance, safe industry, education development Conslack of advancement, slow moving industry, mediocre health benefits 2.0 Quality Assurance Engineer | Lone Tree, CO | Dec 28, 2017 Upper Management Dream, Employee (contractor) Nightmare Schwab used to be a great place to work at, but recently the culture changed to more of a \"old-boys club\" where the management only cares about themselves. I worked as a contractor there for years with it being no secret that I wanted to be converted, but each time it was brought up there were just excuses given on why they couldn't convert me. \"Not enough in the budget\", \"You get paid more contracting!\", \"We need a little more time to see if there's space in the office\". You would hear these excuses, then get emails the same day introducing a new manager hire that has no employees under them. We lost a lot of good talent due to politics in the workplace - constant in-fighting by Directors on the direction IT should take, which would leave the work to be in-flux. Entire teams would go from close to 20 people to 8 in a matter of months due to poor management, direction and opportunities to advance. It seemed the only way to get ahead was to personally know some one high up - not by providing quality work. Only direct managers were typically those who you could trust (a few directors were trustworthy, too) as they fought to keep you on-board and get your hired as an FTE. If you work as a contractor there, don't expect to be treated like an FTE. The environment tends to lean towards making contractors feel like 2nd-class citizens. I thoroughly enjoyed working with many of my co-workers and direct managers, which is the only reason I stayed, but that only helps ...more ProsWFH (limited hours), great co-workers ConsPoor management, no chance of advancement, pay can be low, stressful environment, poor attitude towards contractors 4.0 Registered Representative | Indianapolis, IN | Apr 24, 2014 Good supports and education! Overall I think Charles Schwab is a good place to work. I worked as a Registered Representative in the call center in Indianapolis. The pay is $40,000. per year plus the opportunity to work overtime during the tax season and various other times when call volumes are high. They provide quality training on cashiering, placing stock trades, basic option trades and basic market information. The training helped me feel comfortable providing customer service on the phone. I did not enjoy the job however. The customers really annoyed me; many would call requesting password resets or they would have me place simple trades for them (costing them $33.95). They could place the same trade on the website in mere seconds for only $8.95 (Usually old people stubborn in their ways). Of the 30-70 calls per day, roughly 10 to 20% of calls on any given day would include customers railing on Obama, espousing the virtues of Reaganomics, hating on Kramer, or claiming that \"you guys,\" are cheating me out of my dividends! Just not the type of work I am passionate about but I did get my Series 7 and 63 so I guess that is something...I may never use it but...If I were a betting man (and I guess I am) I would think that jobs like reps in a call center would become increasingly automated as companies try in earnest to become as efficient as possible and at the same time provide excellent customer service and bringing in as many client assets as humanly and robotically possible.

If you are looking for a company who is creating products based on things like A/B user testing, data driven product development, design or technology led solutions (as opposed to decrees handed down randomly based on feedback or wishlist items from a high executives friend) or a collaborative design + technology culture, Schwab is not it. Teams work in silos with little to no communication between departments. This is the opposite of how most FAANG companies set up their teams. Top leadership of these different silos squabble over 'owning' shared resources which gives the impression they care more about resume item successes or ego than actual client solutions. Culture fosters no insentive to innovate, collaborate cross department, or try new ideas. Managers or teams which try to change this culture see themselves blocked, defunded or moved. Culture is very delivery focused. If you are interested in a stable, no thrills, and a 'just tell me what I need to accomplish today' environment which compensates well, Schwab is wonderful. If you are one to ask 'why is this needed', 'why do it this way', or 'who has done this before', Schwab is not a good fit.

I thought this was only on my team but soon I learned it was across the board. The people behaved very much like we were in high school. The technology can be glitchy and you are expected to deal with it. They do have on-site and phone-based technicians to resolve your tech issues but the this can often take a chunk of time away from you and you are still required to meet your deadlines. ...This happens often. The coffee is free but it sucks, the cafeteria makes great breakfast and good lunch with special visiting vendors. Overall the company is great to work for but this Orlando location needs some focus on more in depth training and more accountable managers and team leads. They teach you how to work the phones, give overviews of some, not all, topics, then they throw you to the wolves with a 2 month \"safe period\". The policies are constantly changing along with your work-load and their expectations of you as an employee. The team leads seem underqualified and the managers too busy most times to help. It is a challenging role, but it is a good company. If you are experienced you should be fine, otherwise you might want a different role.

Asked Aug 29, 2016 Micromanaged, clueless management, favoritism. Those are the 3 key words you need to know.
