There were several studios I worked at in my time there, even as I moved from one part of the country to the other. A large part of the OTF experience is based on the management of the franchise(s) where you are employed. That's where most of the culture and pay structure stem from. That being said, I can offer a few general insights into coaching at OTF. Objectively speaking, can be a great fitness instructor and a horrible OTF coach. Likewise, you can be a great coach for OTF and not the most knowledgeable about fitness and movement. So much of the job is about being able to deliver the sizzle, with not as much focus on the steak. Be prepared for a bit of a learning curve for running classes. It's very much like being on a stage or under a microscope. Even if you have lots of experience as a coach or a performer, it takes some time. This job is primarily about executing a specific set of instructions in specific time intervals. It's not very demanding intellectually, but you do have lots of balls in the air at once to juggle. It can be very corporate. So much of the attention is towards towing the company line. There's not much room for real growth as a fitness professional. It's a bit easier to handle if you want to drink the Kool-aid and go all in. It's not always the best fit if you are an independent thi...more 2.0 Front Desk Agent | Austin, TX | Feb 12, 2019 Flexible place to work if you're a student, but definitely a headache. A typical day at work consists of making phone calls, emails, etc. trying to sell memberships. The best part about working there was getting able to interact with the members. As far as the work place goes, it's not a hard job. It's literally a laid back job but at times, it's often boring. They won't allow you to do homework in between classes (usually there's like a three hour window between the noon class and the three o clock class). During that time, you're supposed to be marketing to get people inside the studio to try a class. Which is great, that's the job of a sales associate. However the studio that I worked at was terrible at this. There would usually only be one of us working during this time so I couldn't leave the studio therefore it left us no time to market which equals no leads. So when that happens, you're either hoping for a TI or calling previous leads or members that have told the previous employee a million times to leave them alone and that they're not interested. Then your manager expects you to sell 30-40 memberships a week. How do we do that when you're not giving us time to market? It's almost like they expect you to market during your free time which is ridiculous considering you typically are paid $10 an hour plus commission. The commission isn't great either. It's based on a point system per month and it increases once you pass a certain amount of points. Very confusing and not worth it.

I was corporately trained and began working as an SA (membership advisor) from the very beginning. That was in October 2017. I have to say corporate training was BRUTIAL. For one week straight you would workout every single morning at 6am, followed by a 14 hour training session every day. I have to say I honestly didn\u2019t think I was going to make it, but after roughing it out I\u2019m still here a year and a half later still working for the company. I cannot say enough positive things about my work enviornment. It\u2019s fun, everchanging, and productive. We get tons of members for this gym by doing events, personal advertising, referrals, and following up with warm leads. The amount of money we bring in for the company is incredible. Now I must add, we do make commission for sales, but that leaves us short when we have super slow months. Now for the salary! My starting pay was $10 an hour and then add whatever commission you make. You make anywhere between $5-12 depending on the type of membership you sell, and with the price of the memberships being slightly high it\u2019s not something easy to sell. By all means the membership is worth what it costs, however people who haven\u2019t really worked out at a good quality gym before aren\u2019t expecting that number. Here I am, a year and a half later and I am STILL making $10 an hour.

I am a trainer with many years experience and I have NEVER been fired from any gym! The head trainer was a terrible micromanager and a control freak. I work with plenty of people over the years and get along well with most. The job requires for you to do a training for about a week and several weeks shadowing other coaches classes. I would shadow the head coach most times. Eventually you get to do a small section of the class until you end up teaching a whole class. They don't give you time to learn. It appeared to me she nit picked everything I did. Which is tough for a trainer who has been in the business for along time. Whenever I've learned a new discipline there is time given to get better at it. I feel I was fired because I could not attend a meeting where i had to role play with the front desk..meanwhile I have attended everything else. I have other jobs at other gyms because thats how I make a living. This role play thing could of been done at any other time, but because she is a control freak and I said \"I can't do it today\" she fired me. Not to mention you have to come in 30 minutes before class in case there are new people joining the class...which she never really went over with me and you will be staying 20-30 min after class if you taught the last class of the morning or evening because you have to empty trash of wipes water bottles and coffee cups YUCK and vacu...more Prosgreat stereo, nice selection of clothes Consmicromanagement is the way here, cleaning up trash and vacuuming 1.0 Sales Associate | United States | May 24, 2019 Zero work life balance and constant micromanaging Every OTF has multiple cameras facing the desk which is intended for security purposes, but every manager I\u2019ve had uses it to spy on their employees. If you so much as look in the wrong direction, they message you and act like you\u2019re the worst employee in the world. Will reject time off or completely ignore; tell you to reschedule a doctor\u2019s appointment and \u201cfigure it out or they\u2019ll figure it out for you\u201d; ridiculous policies that you have to support and fight with 700 clients every day about; absolutely zero fun allowed; and terrible pay. Been there for a year, and they still pay me what they did when I was first hired, always saying \u201cOh I keep forgetting about your performance reviews\u201d. It\u2019s the same with all my coworkers, despite growing by 200 clients in the past 6 months. Management is AWFUL!!!!!!! Clients and employees are leaving left and right!!!! They offer you a free membership, but with how much you hate your job and since you don\u2019t get paid to workout, you don\u2019t use it. There\u2019s so much work to do that taking a break doesn\u2019t even seem doable, but if you don\u2019t take a break you get yelled at because \u201cthat\u2019s illegal\u201d. If you do, you get yelled at because you \u201cdidn\u2019t get everything done\u201d (i.e., pick up a speck of dust or put a pad of sticky notes in the desk) or you went when \u201cthere was a client in the studio\u201d.

The wage was low for the amount of energy I had to put in, and management was odd to navigate. I worked long hours and was never told about break policies - I watched my coworkers and eventually learned that nobody really took breaks. This was exhausting, especially when one week I was scheduled to work 8 7-9 hour shifts in a row. I was also expected to do classes at least twice a week. The implication was I could do it when I was there for a shift, but I could not afford to punch put and loose an hour's pay like many of my coworkers seemed to. Generally speaking it seemed like I was the only person there who was working there because I needed the money. After the first two weeks of training i was given almost no managerial support, and no positive or negative feedback of any kind other than a reiteration of my original training - I had no idea how I was performing until the day I left. Orangetheory also offers bonuses for signing up new members. Despite the fact that I signed up quite a few, I only sometimes saw the bonuses. To be fair to orangetheory, if you are looking to work there for free classes it's a perfect job. If you're looking to make a living and care more about general wellness than gym culture, it's probably not the right place for you. ProsFree excellent workout classes, performance based bonuses ConsCulture is not great, management is not great, no break protocol 2.0 Sales Associate | Los Angeles, CA | Jul 6, 2018 Decent - But Major flaws. First if you work at OTF you basically have to LIVE AND BREATHE OTF. You are expected to go on weekend outings, reach out to people in public, and post it all over social media. If you clock out you never really clock out - coworkers and managers will message you off the clock constantly about work related thingS got a call and texts from my boss on a holiday where everyone was off. No sick pay, no paid vacation, and pay scheduling is supposed to be 2 set days of the month but is inconsistent and can fall in the middle Of the week after 17 days of not getting paid since the last paycheck. No health or any other benefits at all. If your coworkers are slacking you have to pick up the slack. It seems like the social aspect of OTF is more important than the operational factors and employees forget to terminate memberships, dompaperwork and such that causes a huge headache for whoever sadly gets to deal with th angry member. Management has no experience what so ever, boss has no idea what they are doing, and is never there. You always forget what you are doing because you are constantly interrupted by members and by the end of the shift there\u2019s 100 things you still have to do. Members are amazing and appreciate you Pay is decent but with the cost of living in my are impossible to live off of. Unrealistic sales goals with the studio already packed. ProsTeam driven, free membership, learn sales skills ConsStressful for a gym sales associate, no benefits, no paid time off, etc 2.0 Studio Manager | Shawnee, KS | Jun 19, 2019 Great job if you're single or have no life Fun job if you're single or don't have any other interests outside of work. It's definitely not family friendly. No flexibility on scheduling. Studios are open 7 days a week, holidays, etc. There are no benefits that are worth sharing. No 401k, profit sharing, etc. They provide what they are required by law to provide - health insurance if you qualify. Yes, you get free workouts but you are working so much that you either don't have time to workout or are exhausted. Managers and asst managers can expect to work about 60 hours a week, with one day off per week. However if you're not meeting sales requirements you may be working 7 days a week. Sales and numbers are way more important than customer service and client relationships. Used to be much more boutique like with an emphasis on the personal experience, but because the market is getting more saturated powers that be are much more focused on new member numbers, while retention efforts are few and far between. It's franchisee/owner friendly - sales associate pay is abhorrent at $10/hour and the sales requirements, noting logs, paperwork, notating every call, every interaction, reminders, being on script for everything you say and do, following many different processes depending on the situation, cleaning, etc is a lot to ask for that amount of money. They say you can make much more and you can IF you work many, many hours. 1.0 Sales Associate | Madison, WI | Jul 14, 2016 Would NOT Recommend Wasting Your Time With This Company First of all, compensation (including commission scale) is so low that you'll never be able to afford life. No benefits, no salary, no PTO, no room for growth or advancement...aka zero perks other than being able to workout there for free. They expect way more out of you than a $10/hour job is worth. The gas station across the street is hiring for just as much. Managers/owners of the studio expect you to drive all around the city to reach out to businesses, but aren't willing to reimburse for mileage. They also want all advertising to be free and reciprocal between businesses, and aren't willing to pay for anything. I'm not sure if this applies to all Orangetheory's or if it is just the owners of the studio I work at. I've truly never worked for a company who's employees are so unhappy and constantly searching for other jobs. Management is terrible at communicating, not only with their staff but with the studio members as well. All of my co-workers were AWESOME and we all still hang out regardless of people moving on to other jobs. All the sales associates and trainers get along so well that it's a shame that OTF keeps losing such valuable employees due to the low pay and lack of incentive to stay and advance. ProsWorkout for Free ConsNo benefits, No Paid Time Off or Vacation, No salary, No room for advancement 2.0 Assistant Manager | Baltimore, MD | Sep 26, 2019 Don't get too attached Genuinely enjoyed working here, briefly. Cold calling, check ins, sales, and clean up were your basic duties; very simple and stress free work. I was hired by one manager, who resigned a couple months later. Employees warned me about the hire turnover rate, telling me most people do not last 3 months. The new manager seemed very promising, but he still has a lot to learn about actual quality leadership and fair management, which will come with more experience. The owners are an awesome couple, unfortunately they neglect their facility until the ceiling falls apart (literally) and do not have much motivation to do any preventative maintenance that isn't MacGyver'd until it is way past too late. The ceiling would (often) collapse in the middle of a group fitness class, we could complain daily, the Head Coach could be in tears about it and there would still be no permanent action taken to prevent the issues from happening again. I was ultimately terminated without warning or any prior disciplinary action for really nonsensical reasons. After contacting Dept of Human Services and MD's Unemployment Law, both determined that I did not partake in any misconduct that should have led to my termination. (Not to mention, the firing manager perjured to the Dept of Human Services, so I certainly have a case!)
