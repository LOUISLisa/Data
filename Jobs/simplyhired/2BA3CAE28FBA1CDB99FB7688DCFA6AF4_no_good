I felt like they gave you opportunity for change and advancement if you wanted. I learned a lot while working there. Returning to the hospital setting after a few years and so many changes along the way. But, they always made you feel comfortable to ask questions and were available for more education if needed. Prosopportunity for different departments if you wanted to change ConsNight shift was not for me. Was glad when I had the opportunity to transfer to days. 1.0 Mental Health Technician | Baton Rouge, LA | Aug 24, 2019 Ratio is not fair for one tech 24 patients for four hours is not real management does not talk to their employees with dignity. Your job status is always on the line. Full time status goes strait to PRN. Where do they do that at ProsNo pros ConsManagement sucks 1.0 Emergency Room Technician | The Woodlands, TX | Dec 3, 2019 Horrible The facility was run extremely poorly for years until the company was bought out by CHI St. Lukes. All three facilities were shut down just after being purchased. 1.0 Laboratory Technician | New York, NY | Sep 7, 2019 Worst place to work. The corporate culture of Apollo(Belapur,Navi Mumbai) maybe best for patients/beneficiary,but a nightmare for employees. The working shifts are horrible,the working conditions so hectic,the seniors (pathologists,HOD,HR) are the hunters who take a whiplash at you time and again,and best part is the management is least bothered about nothing. 5.0 Registered Nurse | United States | Jun 16, 2020 Excellent experience...Now i can stand my own.
