I started in August 2018. I had a great interview with the terminal Manager and felt a good culture vibe from the start despite the terminal being very ragged,old and just dirty. The Job is like any other p and d job for the most part except the freight is junk and damaged 90% of the time. You are expected to try and pawn it off on the customer unless its broken glass. Most of the trucks and trailers are junk with the exception of a few. The supervisor is a former driver and really tries to do a good job although he is still learning as he goes. The culture changes over time and becomes stressful when your driving junk and delivering junk freight. So to wrap up the review and why I departed. I put in for three in paid days off (which were denied). There were two drivers scheduled off on one of the days(plus the terminal manager)and only one the other two. I was willing to be reprimanded for the days because my son was graduating high school out of state and it wasn't an option to miss(I had no paid days left due to moving and retrieving belongings from out of state). When I returned I was asked to go to the terminal managers office and told this was my sixth unexcused absence and grounds for termination. I was never informed of 1,2 or 3 although the policy is a coaching after 3. I was told the 3rd absence occurred on May 3 and I never received a coaching. I asked the terminal manager why I didnt receive the coaching which occurred almost 30 days prior he told me he didn't kn...more ConsNO Overtime till 52(you'll never get it). 3.0 Driver | Winchester, VA | Jun 3, 2019 Don't Get Hurt on the Job Here They will try everything in there power to give you no help medically past there expectations to get you better. Then when they do they ask you to sign a paper that you can never return to work for the company if you do get better. They over load there trailers and lift gates. They tell you figure out some way of getting your job done, but don't care if it's not OSHA safe. Putting 3000 lbs Electrical wire as tall and as wide as the trailer and expect you to put it on a lift gate. When you pull it on the lift gate the dolly has to hang off as the top is tipping forward. The dock over loads the ends of the trailers when you get to your first destination and open the your lucky if it don't just fall when the door is open. I didn't mind the work just the idiot calls from a superior when asked to do something unsafe. I showed up on time and rain when there was bad conditions most would call off. When i step in front of something that was about to fall on customer my back got hurt and they turned there backs on me when i needed them most. They put me on light duty which caused my back to take twice as long to heal. When the doctor said it would be a year or two before i see any sign in relief from my back. they wanted nothing to do with me. Doctors gave me 30-40% disability to my back and they let me go. Gave me option of a settlement but i could never work for them in my life again. The way the acted I done knew they wasn't going to let me work there again. Save them a lawsuit and...more ProsGood Pay, Off Most Weekends, Overtime after 50 ConsDon't care about you as long as you deliver the product 1.0 Dock Worker | Fontana, CA | Mar 6, 2019 Poor Managment at the Riverside terminal I worked there for almost two years. When I initially started there was an appreciative atmosphere where everyone seemed to love their jobs. We worked together and got what needed to be done, done. Fast forward a few months and management changes. Work piles up and daily there were meetings about mandatory OT and mandatory 6 days. During these meetings management would berate every employee for any millisecond of idle time and threaten to terminate anyone for even having their phone in their pockets. Despite this negative culture at the riverside terminal, I endured and got paid. They pay very well. However one manager in particular would always find a way to write me up, despite it not being his department. He would go out of his way to find something and write me up for things previous supervisors and managers didn't write me up for. Then one day while asleep for work, the ATM called me and suspended me without giving me a reason. I called back and pleaded for an explanation and received nothing until I was called and terminated without an explanation. To make a long story short. You will work, and you will hustle and you will get paid but they seemingly decide to clean house on the regular. I've seen it happen multiple times before it happened to me. The least they could have done is talked to me about why I was terminated. I gave a lot of my time and energy to this company and all for an abrupt termination over the phone and with no explanation whatsoever. ProsGood pay, great coworkers Consfavoritism, excessive OT, destructive attitudes from managament 2.0 Senior Customer Support Representative | California | Nov 2, 2018 Its ok... As a 20 something-year-old college student, this job was great money. I'm getting paid almost double what my peers make and I'm gaining good professional experience with it. Manager was super flexible with my hours and as long as you get your work done and can be relied on, the management will love you. HOWEVER: If you are the type of person to care and have passion for your job (no matter what) then you'll see great disappointment in this field. The entire freight industry is based on people needing products, and you're the service that gets the product to them. No matter what you do to enforce policy (i.e., trying to get people to pay for freight charges in full, getting people to give you correct paperwork, etc.) the customer will always win. \"As long as the freight is delivered, nothing else matters\" is what I was told. They will give you the entire procedure to follow but management will not follow it if it means freight will not be delivered. This is quite unfortunate because you can see the loss of revenue right in front of your eyes- yet it doesn't matter because freight was delivered. If you're someone who just needs a job and doesn't place passion and work in the same realm, then this industry is perfect for you. ProsFlexible scheduling, good pay, good benefits, vacation, sick pay, 401k, good people ConsPoor management, poor quality-control, people who lose the company (a great deal of) money won't get fired, overtime starts at 48 hours for drivers, overworked 1.0 Accounts Payable Clerk | Richmond, VA | May 10, 2019 Employees treat it like high school, bullies in management I am so disappointed in the failure to deliver on promises. Rude and even downright cruel management, gossip, and failure to follow their own procedures. Management is good at the work aspect, but their people skills are lacking. Expect cruel comments if you aren't a cookie cutter person. Expect manually flipping through as much as 2000 or more checks in order to find faulty prints or blank pages, and even management spearheading a operating hours shopping trip for their favoured employees, allowing them to leave their work on your desk, as everything is time sensitive and needs finished accordingly. Management has outbursts of anger, definitely not for meek individuals. If management makes a mistake, they blame the employee. Management will have family visit all day even though it is a closed facility. Work dispersal is extremely biased. Management has sign pinned up in her office with offensive language, swears profusely. And don't expect to stay long. They don't promote from within the company. They hire temps after their contract minimum, keep them for six months, then replace them with temps. ProsKitchen staff is nice, courtyard well maintained, other departments nice, treasurer is a wonderful man ConsAdults acting like teenagers 2.0 Forklift Operator | York, PA | May 28, 2020 If your a female and want to work on the dock - don't apply here I guess I should start out with the good rather than the bad. I was a part time forklift operator employed at Estes, the pay is GREAT, but the people employed there are what make you want to pull your hair out. They worked well with my schooling and were willing to let me choose what days and hours I worked, which was awesome. On the downside, this company will work full timers to the bone during busy season but during slow season will restrict the employees to part time hours. And please read this before applying,******** you will not get OT pay until you have worked 52 HOURS, yeah I know right. Management is absolutely ridiculous, half the time dockworkers know more than upper management does. Whenever a new policy is put into place it sticks for a week than is never enforced again. The other employees do not look when backing up their forklift and take multiple smoke breaks throughout their day, so riddle me this, 10 minutes an hour for a smoke break is the equivalent to 80 minutes so there's one and a half hours they're getting paid to smoke a cancer stick, but nothing gets said to them. If your a female and want to work on the dock, please don't, you'll not only have, management out to get you but certain dockworkers too. I worked here 2 1/2 years. 5.0 Operations Lead | Billings, MT | Apr 5, 2020 A+ company, great to be here. I'm part of a crew that helped open up and establish a new terminal with the company. It's been a wild ride... in a good way. Though I have 10 years in LTL industry knowledge, learning the Estes way, or getting \"Estefied\", has been a valuable (l)earning experience. The company has a huge focus of customer satisfaction and on time deliveries. Of course those are key metrics of success, but they do that while striking that balance with employee satisfaction as well. I've worked at different companies where I felt the driver was the enemy, and this is a complete 180 from that. The culture here, at least from what I've seen and experienced, is right on par with an article about them being one of the 500 best companies to work for. I've worked at both ends of the spectrum, and I like what I've seen here. I hope to be here a long time and look forward to continuing support from management as I grow my career with the company. I feel lucky to be here. reasreasons ProsPay, supportive management, hours, job security, crew I work with, equipment ConsNone 4.0 Driver | Columbia, MO | Oct 7, 2018 Estes is a decent LTL company. Better than most. Working nights beginning at approx. 8 pm through to 10 to 11am. How to manage time and resources quite well. Self started is a must! Favorable management. Great employees overall. Competitive atmosphere at times. The hardest part of the job is being gone a full week from home. The most enjoyable part is knowing you are doing a job some would not, or could not do. All LTL companies are Federally regulated. Regulations must be followed. Any mistake or lack of following through can result in fines and CSA points on your license, or worse. Much worse. An accident, regardless of fault, can result in property damage, loss of life and the list goes on. Making sure your equipment is safe and secure for transport has to be your first priority. A great deal is expected of any Transport Driver. As it should be. The trick, I believe, is to remind yourself of the responsibility accompanying the occupation. Every day. Every hour. Every second if need be. ProsFair compensation. Flexible ConsVery little home time 1.0 Operations Supervisor | Eighty Four, PA | Jul 9, 2019 Do not work here!!!! There are too many other freight companies!! Absolutely zero work life balance, sometimes I worked 17 hour shifts and I was salary! Meanwhile the terminal manager who is breathing down your throat only works 8!!!???!!!!!! do not even apply here, this is by far the most negative, draining, unorganized place I have ever seen! The company as a whole is actually pretty solid, they have zero debt and new equipment etc but the Pittsburgh terminal in Eighty Four is a complete nightmare!!! Nobody knows what they are doing and all they do is try to fire people and write people up. The terminal manager will put everybody against each other and stirs up drama whenever the chance presents itself! I\u2019ve never seen anything like it! The fish rots from the head down! Upper management is the worst I ever encountered. Everybody there feels the same, the turnover on the management side is every couple of months! Do your self a favor and do not come to this Conundrum! ProsExperience ConsEverything involved with working here! 3.0 Forklift Operator | Charlotte, NC | May 13, 2019 Not a Terrible place to work overall. Estes Express Charlotte is a good place to work with good benefits, but over the course time you work there, management will start to run over you. If you become more valuable, say like an asset: it\u2019s not appreciated. You\u2019ll be used and stuck covering one shift for a years time that you didn\u2019t sign up for. But since management has all the power, your opinion doesn\u2019t matter. You can be the best on one shift and suck at the same job on another shift. The reason I left was management didn\u2019t pay any attention to the time off requests put in for, months in advance. And when you mentioned you had vacation coming up, they would say, when were you planning on letting us know you had days off coming up?. A shame the company didn\u2019t value important time off requests made by the employee. ProsExcellent Pay & Benefits, Paid time off. ConsManagement doesn\u2019t stick up for the Employee. If they can place all the blame on you, they will. Just so they won\u2019t get any blame.
