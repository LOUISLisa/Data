I've been working with Qkids for about 7 months now, and it's been great! If you work 7 days a week, for the 2 hours that are available each morning, you make around $1000-$1200 a month, which is pretty awesome. And during the summer there's a chance to earn even more because they open 5 classes each night, since the kids are on summer break. A lot of people complain they don't give you very many hours, which is true at the start, since older teachers get priority, but once you've been there for a few months, you start getting more classes. Also, the amount of classes you get depends on the family's feedback the previous week. If, for example, you got 1 negative feedback, I've noticed they'll take away 1 class from your availability schedule for the next week. I understand the reason for this, but it can also be a bad thing if some parent didn't like you for whatever reason and decided to give you 5 bad marks, meaning you'd lose 5 slots for the next week. You just have to do your best, be cheerful, and make the kids feel comfortable with you and usually there's no problems. The only downside would be that the classes are super early in the morning. Classes start at 6:30am during the spring/summer months, and fall back to 5:30am during the fall/winter months due to the time change. I live on the East Coast, so it's not a big problem for me, but for someone living on the West Coast, this means getting starting class at 3:30am each morning during the summer, and starting a...more ProsGreat Pay, Easy Work, Flexible Hours ConsEarly Morning Classes, Tougher Regulations 5.0 English As A Second Language Teacher | San Diego, CA | Apr 9, 2020 Qkids is the best and makes a great side gig I love working for Qkids and I've been working since early 2019! This is my first online job and teaching ESL online. I researched other ESL companies and narrowed it down to Qkids -- the best choice! I love their teaching platform as well compared to other companies that I have seen online, which makes Qkids my standard for ESL companies. Qkids operates on EST (EDT) time, so if you're in another time zone, just be sure to keep that in mind. I'm on PST (PDT) time so waking up at 3am in the morning became my routine. Typically, I teach 4 lessons in the morning everyday (7 days) and the lessons are 30 minutes each, can range from 1-4 students in a lesson. Afterwards, you get to evaluate the students and parents will be able to provide feedback on how you taught. There are some lessons offered in the evening, but mornings are best. Each lesson is assigned, $8/lesson, but if you work an hour, it's $16/hour. There are Standby's (waiting if you need to replace another teacher) in which you get paid $4/lesson, but if it converts to an actual class, you get paid $8 for that lesson. You also get a bonus for $1/lesson attendance and $1/lesson performance (based on parents evaluations). In a sense, you can make $16-$20/hour. Also, the hours are not always guaranteed, although you will be able to see what classes you will be assigned a week prior. From what I hear from teachers starting out, there aren't many lessons available to them, but I believe the longer your work, you...more 1.0 Teacher | Remote | Feb 22, 2019 They have poor hiring practices and lie about it I reviewed their technical requirements before I applied. I have a Mac so I don\u2019t apply for jobs that require Windows OS. I also have a laptop so don\u2019t apply for things that require desktops. Etc. I don\u2019t like wasting my time because of things like that so I\u2019m thorough. Qkids mention they recommend a connected internet but no where on their site does it say required. My mbps was much higher than required so I applied. I was selected for a demo interview and spent several hours reviewing the material and making sure I knew how the system worked and could teach the games. When it came time for my interview she asked if I had connected internet. I explained I did not and it was not possible for me to have it. I can\u2019t be in a quiet place and connect to the box which is in the living room. I also have a MacBook that doesn\u2019t have an Ethernet port and won\u2019t pay the money to buy the connection cable when wireless internet works just as well. When I was honest about my system she suddenly said \u201coh well you\u2019ve already frozen a few times so it\u2019s not a good connection\u201d Everything was fine on my end and she said \u201cthat\u2019s because I have wired internet\u201d She refused to continue my interview even though everything tech wise was working great. I explained that according to the website connected internet is not a requirement and that I had higher than the required speed. She acted as if that wasn\u2019t what the website said and I was wrong. I know they had a big hiring advertisement so it\u2019s ...more ProsI\u2019ve heard if you\u2019re hired and have absolutely no problems it can be a good gig ConsNot honest about their recruitment and technical requirements 5.0 English As A Second Language Teacher | Remote | Jan 17, 2019 Solid Work from Home Option I taught for Qkids for about 6 months. I started during the summer (busy season) and stayed on through the winter until I found a full time job. The hiring process was very long (3 weeks start to finish) but not difficult. It involved a demo video you record yourself, a few online classroom sessions with a trainer, and 2-5 trial classes with real students and trainer feedback. I read that with many online teaching companies, it can be difficult getting \"booked\" for classes. I always received all of the classes I asked for with Qkids, and depending on how much I was able to work, made between $500-$1,000 a month part-time. I was worried about being fired with little or no notice, because I sometimes had to cancel classes, and in the beginning I got a few negative parent reviews. Nothing ever came of these, though. In fact, when I apologized for a few poor classes and explained I'd taken on way too many hours, my trainer/company liason was very understanding and told me to take as much time off as I needed. After a few months I got used to the classes and received nothing but positive parent reviews. When I had to cancel a class with advanced notice, or when something went wrong with my internet or the software, Qkids was very understanding. It was easy to take a week or even 2 weeks off to travel, no questions asked. The lessons eventually got very repetitive and the hours are brutal, especially on the west coast during daylight savings time. Neither of these ar...more ProsRidiculously flexible scheduling. Easy to get (unpaid) time off. ConsBrutal hours, repetitive lessons, lapses in communication at times 5.0 Tutor | Remote | Jul 21, 2018 Cute kids, great company I have been working with QKids for about a month now, and I absolutely love it! The kids are fantastic and love to learn, for the most part, and the parents are supportive. The company provides lots of training and support if you need it, and they go out of their way to assist you if you have a problem. They're extremely understanding of teacher absences. The general vibe is very positive and friendly, and I almost always get all of the hours I open up with them. They're also very responsive to feedback. Previous reviews mentioned the teacher rating system and losing their positions because of it. That rating system has since changed and become much more manageable, and if teachers are struggling they step in and assist with extra coaching. I think the thing I enjoy the most about this company, aside from how well they take care of their teachers and how awesome the kids are, is the instructional materials are so well done. I have to do very little prep before teaching, because the games in the program make the lessons incredibly interactive. No props, no super-energetic-early-in-the-morning, happy-go-lucky peppiness - just teaching, pure and simple. I don't feel like I'm putting on a show, which means that I can be myself and focus on what matters most - that the kids learn the English they're paying to learn. I would HIGHLY recommend working for QKids, especially if this is your first time applying for such a company. QKids is fantastic. ProsWork from home, set own hours, great kids, lots of support, pay is on time, almost always get your hours, easy-to-use curriculum ConsVERY EARLY MORNING, occasional tech issues (but they're quickly resolved), lack of opportunity for advancement, and lack of opportunity for increasing salary beyond bonuses. 5.0 Teacher | West Virginia | Aug 21, 2018 Qkids Best Job I have Ever Had. Qkids is the best company I have ever worked for. I always get 20 dollars an hour. Very rare to not get your bonus. Company is amazing. They work with you if you need to miss a class or a day. The children are amazing. I work with 3 year old kids and up. The software is great and very easy to learn. The staff always gets back with you immediately to answer and questions you may have. Each class is 30 mins long. You have anywhere from 1 to four kids in each class. All the children already know some English and the younger children always have parents there to help, so you do not have to know a word of Chinese. Which is great because I don't LOL. That was my only worry. How would I be able to get the kids to understand what I what them to do if they don't know any English yet. The parents always help with the younger kids to help them understand what they are supposed to do. Most of the kids already know how to play the games and know they are supposed to repeat after Koby and Momo (Qkids characters), so cute. I make around 1,300 to 1,450 a month, but I choose to take all the hours they offer. Right now they are offering more classes in the evening on the weekdays because school is out in China for the summer. Once school is back in the classes in the evening will go back to Fri and Sat only. Which is their Sat and Sun mornings. If you love kids and Love to teach, this is the best job you could ever ask for and the money is great. ProsMoney is great, kids, parents, staff is wonderful, software is great. ConsOnly part time hours. 1.0 Teacher | Remote | Jun 6, 2020 Waste of time Just felt I needed to add the review that would have helped me when I was reading through these, especially since you will spend a lot of (unpaid) time preparing, learning and practicing(and money spent) for this job(in which you are an independent contractor- so they have no obligation to you). The staff is very friendly and the platform is fun. It's great that you don't have to use your own props. However, there is an unspoken competitive nature that if you don't know about, will mean that you possibly waste all of that time practicing lessons, getting through the mock trials and through the first week in which they give you hours. There will be parents sitting beside their children and judging(also sometimes filming you with their phones, hitting their kids upside the head when they don't answer correctly, sometimes speaking very loudly in the background and adding positive/negative \"tags\" for) you. There is a big emphasis on giving all of the students an equal amount of diamonds(and making sure you give away ALL the diamonds) and you need to be very familiar with the stickers and masks and doing all kinds of tricks and games with them. Having some kind of gimmicky thing with stuffed animals or extra \"not necessary props\" seems to be popular also. Those things are not emphasized by the staff and \"not a big deal\" from the fb support group. But from what I picked up, they are very important to ensure you retain bookings. Good luck! Prosplatform Consnone if you get into this kind of thing 5.0 Tutor | United States | May 2, 2019 Amazing job This job is like a dream come true. A typical day for me looks like this: 6:23am - Wake up 6:35-6:40am - Greet my students and introduce my name 6:40-7:10am - Smiling faces practicing english on an interactive platform. I'm guiding them through the games. 7:10-7:15am - bye students! **3 more classes** I end my day around 9:10 am. The pay isn't as much as other companies, but their platform really makes up for it. If you are a teacher who doesn't like props, you wont need it here. I love that you can request unlimited time off (you only have to request more than 5 hours ahead. thats it!) I love that they only require a 5 hour notice if you need to take off. And you may request unlimited days off at any time. There is no penalty for being sick or having and emergency with your kids if you request more than 5 hours in advance. Sometimes, my students really brighten up my bad mood. One lesson, we learned the word love. At the end of class my student says \"wait, teacher!\" and I said \"yes Elsa?\" \"I love you, teacher.\" I almost fainted it was so cute my heart melted. This happens all the time! They are so sweet and just worth waking up for every single day. I will keep this job as long as I can. They really look for animated faces and expression. They prize interactive and passionate teachers here. If you are looking for a work from home job that trumps all others, this is it!!!! Prosunlimited time off, flexible schedule, opportunity for bonus Consnot enough hours to work full time so you will likely still need a day job or another side gig 4.0 English As A Second Language Teacher | Midland, MI | Apr 19, 2019 It's good extra income I like working for Qkids, I have been with them for over a year now. You can make your own schedule, you can call off as long as it is 5 hours in advance, and working with the kids is fun, my bosses are really nice. You get paid to be at home... It is however important to understand the downsides of this company 1) You will either teach classes that are 1v4(30 minutes) or 1v1 (25 minutes) and will be paid the same amount for either class, which is not right. Teaching 4 kids is a lot more work and those 5 extra minutes are valuable when your classes are all back to back. 2) Choosing your classes is awesome. The hours are poor though because of the time zone difference. The only shifts (EST) are 6:40, 7:20, 8:00, and 8:40 am monday to friday, and there are evening classes available friday and saturday nights. The only way to make over $1000/ month is to teach classes every morning and also work the split shifts on the weekends. It gets old after a few months. 3) If you are depending on this money to pay bills, I wouldn't do it. The bookings can vary greatly, you will never get a raise, payment for classes depends on parent review, you only get paid once a month. You are a contracted employee, there are no benefits and you are up for review every 6 months where you can be let go with a weeks notice. Qkids is a good company, but there is work to be done. If you are just looking for extra pocket money, by all means go for it ProsWork from Home, Nice bosses ConsLow pay, Poor hours 4.0 English As A Second Language Teacher | Remote | Mar 7, 2019 Good and Bad If you want to have a great job at home teaching kids and have fun, then this is really awesome. The pay is good if you take on the hours, but it is really hard to not function as a zombie in this position. You fake a smile when you are pretending to be enthusiastic in the ungodly morning and graveyard night hours to teach. The job isn't enough to cover rent, yet they are beginning to require expensive teaching certifications and not increasing pay or benefits. The job doesn't pay enough to require paid and certified teachers. A lot of people have to have a second job-even though this job is on the computer at home! It simply doesn't provide enough hours to make it big. It is great for a little extra cash and it can be worth the experience I have absolutely loved working with the kids and the experience has been really fun. However, keep in mind, that any wages made this year are filed under independent contracts- which means that your taxes take a lot of what little you make working here. I will be quitting this position soon due to the lacking benefits, the early morning hours and because my degree is no longer sufficient teaching qualifications. It feels like it really isn't an investment anymore. If I can't make money or any benefits, this job is almost too exhausting to bother.

Asked Jan 29, 2018 They just updated their regulations: \"In 2020, any independent contractor who does not possess a BA in Education or traditional teaching license, must provide alternative teaching credentials; this is most likely an accredited 120 hour online TESOL or TEFL certificate. Fulfillment of the teaching qualification regulation may vary based on experience, credentials, and qualification type.\" Answered Jan 7, 2020 As noted on the Qkids website, - AA Eligibility is required, but a BA is preferred. If you have less than a BA, you will be required to have a plan to earn a TESOL/TEFL certificate (you can earn this certification online and there are many sites that often have deals on this certification). English teaching certificates (TESOL, TEFL, CELTA, ESL) are preferred. This could change, but as of now, no new updates have been released by the Ministry of Education of the PRC.

Answered Jun 14, 2019 Do you schedule your teaching time slots in advance or is it on a daily basis? How do you get assigned a certain time slot? Asked May 25, 2017 The scheduling procedures have changed recently. You give them your fixed available schedule. Then the company assigns you classes within your schedule. Your schedule will likely be full during peak times of the year, but could be less than full during slow seasons. If you need time off, you request in in the company app. Time off is automatically approved. It is not counted against you if you request off at least 5 hours before that scheduled class. However, repeated/constant requests off may be frowned upon. Please use this link to apply http://teacher.qkids.net/ref?code=RJDTYN or use referral code RJDTYN.

Answered Feb 13, 2019 How long is each class? How much are you paid per a class taught? Asked Jan 14, 2018 Teachers get a base pay of $8 for one 30-minute class. Therefore, you can make a base of $16/hour if you teach 2 full classes. You also get a paid $4 for standby classes (teachers login to the system for 3 minutes before class time and stay until 3 minutes after the class start time. If the class converts to a regular class, you get paid $8 for that class. If you are not needed to teach, you still get paid $4 for being there for those 6 minutes). There are two different possible bonuses you can get per class. Teachers are also eligible for an attendance bonus of $1 PER CLASS (you must teach a minimum of 15 classes that week to be eligible for the attendance bonus). If you are absent without a 5-hour notice, you lose your attendance bonus. You can also earn a review bonus of $1 PER CLASS which is based on your teaching performance and parent rating. With the base pay and bonuses, it is possible to earn $20/hour. Use this link to apply http://teacher.qkids.net/ref?code=RJDTYN or use referral code RJDTYN for prompt attention.

You also get a paid $4 for standby classes (teachers login to the system for 3 minutes before class time and stay until 3 minutes after the class start time. If the class converts to a regular class, you get paid $8 for that class. If you are not needed to teach, you still get paid $4 for being there for those 6 minutes).
