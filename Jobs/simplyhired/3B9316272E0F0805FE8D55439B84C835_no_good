When new inventory came in, emails must be sent to the owners to confirm the successful delivery. Making sure that all sales associates are zoned where assigned and making sure that each zone has appropriate coverage. Visually merchandising walls tables that are not aesthetically appealing. Training all news associates how to maintain and operate the dressing rooms how to maintain their zones. Customer service duties included answering phone calls, emails, and chat requests with issues or concerns with their online or in-store purchase or an unpleasant experience they might have had at our stores. Although the work environment is un and easy-going, I could truly say that there is a strong lack of organization, communication and structure within this workplace. The hardest part of the job was dealing with several closing employees not showing up to their shift, so it would take up to three times as long until all go-backs were properly put back and the store folded perfectly. I often worked shifts lasting 8 hours minumum, but if there was more to be done (often the case) I found myself working 12-14 hour (sometimes longer) shifts. The best part about this job was all of my amazing coworkers. It truly made the staff feel like a team since everyone got along well. Workers were friendly and cooperative if you ordered them to fo...more ProsGreat discount, nice employees, working MANY overtime hours is encouraged. $$ Consmany no-shows, very busy with high traffic, long hours, disorganization and MAJOR lack of structure. 4.0 Processor | Los Angeles, CA | Jul 7, 2015 Growing Company with a good working environment On a typical day i would do online orders get them ready for shipping make sure the order was correct and ship it out with UPS.I learned a lot at this job because i would do a little bit of everything i would help with customer service to shipping orders out of state, to also faxing out receipts. 3.0 Visual Merchandiser | Newport Beach, CA | Jun 23, 2015 Fast paced with visual merchandising freedom A typical day at work includes making sure the store is presentable to the public through folding and meeting visual merchandising standards. Working in retail has strengthened my interpersonal skills towards any age or demographic. The hardest part of the job is keeping the store organized in an efficient manner, as the store is very busy on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job is having visual merchandising freedom. 5.0 Customer Service Representative | Santa Monica, CA | May 9, 2017 Working here was great and helped with gaining experience Working at Brandy Melville was such a fun experience, I loved working with people and helping them solve any issues. We all worked hard to make our customers happy. 1.0 Customer Service Representative | Los Angeles, CA | Feb 3, 2017 Low rate payment I learned so much from Brandy, however, management didn't care for you. They only cared about bringing money and nit about their employees. Over all, i learned so much. 4.0 Sales Lead | Houston, TX | Jan 9, 2020 Management is run by teenagers The management can be difficult to deal with as they are all 20-24 years old. Workplace was a little too casual and it was hard to get the sales associates to complete their tasks. 3.0 Store Manager | Los Angeles, CA | Feb 6, 2020 Relaxed work environment I loved all the people I got to work with. There was a lot of room to grow within the company. Felt I gained industry experience and learned great customer service. 3.0 Photographer | New York, NY | Nov 25, 2017 Weird Bad place to work. Ive worked there for years and nothing has changed. Same horrible management and CEO's. Everything is based on how you look. Please dont work here. 4.0 Retail Assistant Manager | San Francisco, CA | Aug 25, 2018 Easy job Job was really easy the higher ups are just scary. Pay was good in my area the do minimum wage based on your area and they take pictures of your outfits everyday. 4.0 Sales Associate | Canoga Park, CA | Jan 21, 2014 Very productive girls clothing store. Brandy Melville is a great company to work for with something new in store everyday. The managers are nice and willing to help with any questions. Very well customer service skills are required to handle most of our customers, its a pleasure to be apart of a team.
