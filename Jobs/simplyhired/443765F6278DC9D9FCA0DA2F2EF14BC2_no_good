I was able to pay the bills with this job. I also have a very gas-efficient car. 2) The scheduling is amazing. You have near-complete control over when you work. You can either pick your own shifts or become an independent contractor and truly work when you want (though you might make less money this way). 3) The managers were pretty cool and good at getting back to you. I didn't interact much with the other drivers, but they all seemed like nice people. 4) Being in your car all day is actually great. You don't have to stand around making small talk, and there's no petty workplace drama (at least at the delivery driver level). Of course, this isn't a great thing for everyone. You need to enjoy driving and enjoy alone time to enjoy this job. Cons: 1) Stress. I've held a couple of food-service jobs before, including a pizza delivery job. They're always stressful. You always feel a little exploited and under-appreciated. But Waitr is FAR AND AWAY the worst in this regard that I have experienced. The customers are getting bad service, and there's nothing you can do about it. It's usually fine if it isn't busy. But most of the time, a regular weekend rush will turn your entire shift into a disaster. For example, you might be trying to make a delivery that is upwards of ten minutes late.

First things first, the pay IS 5$ an hour for hourly employees and $2.50 a delivery for independent contractors. While scheduling is flexible and you \"create\" your own schedule, you can only pick from a bank of set schedule blocks ranging anywhere from 3 to 6 hours and the availability of the shifts you can/want to work are always contested due to the irregular flow of turn over. Management goes on hiring blitzes and over staffs markets so typically less than half of new hires stay on more than a month. The only way to make money is to HOPE that you deliver to someone who believes in tipping and since the company REFUSES to allow drivers to see how much they are making per delivery there is no way to audit your income. This is especially concerning since dash members (customer service) can split and refund gratuity and the driver would be none the wiser. Logistics AND customer service is typically handled by one person (dash member) and this same person is usually responsible for assigning deliveries to drivers, answering phone calls from customers, issuing refunds, and addressing driver concerns in not just one, but usually 2 markets simultaneously. So, when it gets busy the company more often than not comes to a grinding halt. Drivers can only pick up one delivery at a time without being assigned a second one and to compound the issue the one making the decisions on who is going to be assigned a second order (dash member) is stationed in Louisiana.

I work part time for Waitr and you really need a fuel efficient, reliable car to take full advantage of this job. It is very accommodating, especially if you use it as second job to supplement your income. You won't find a job with hours as flexible as this one except maybe a rideshare employer. There are easy to land evening and weekend shifts, so that is perfect if you are already working a full time job like myself. You schedule yourself 2 weeks out and there are numerous shift ranges to select from, so it is very easy to make the perfect schedule. It is also incredibly simple to pick up a few extra hours if you find yourself with some last minute free time. Evening shifts are almost always available, even minutes before they start. For the most part, shifts tend to stay busy and can get a little hectic on the weekends. You can't be shy and really should contact your customers if you are running late on an order. When it gets extremely busy, orders are assigned to you. During slower hours, you can choose what you want to pick up. There are opportunities to be very efficient to maximize deliveries per hour. Tips are very volatile. Some nights, I can average around $5 per delivery, other nights only $2. It is fairly easy to maintain around 2 deliveries per hour, even on slow nights. The app has the customer tip you out before you ever deliver the food, but you never know when a customer will give you a cash tip, so customer service is still important.

I cannot speak for other markets, only the one I work in. Management is awesome, Dash has made vast improvements on communicating with drivers. It would be beneficial if orders from the same person that have been placed back to back can be automatically assigned to the current driver. I have seen this happen numerous times where two drivers end up at the same address, at the same time, and the order is from the same restaurant. Another area I would like to address is lead drivers. Those chosen for this position should realize they are role models for new and current drivers. The choice to make one a lead driver shouldn\u2019t just focus on how many deliveries one does, or how many hours they work. Some have inadequate people skills and should not be in a leadership position. It can bring the morale of a company down when those in an upper position are talking bad about dashes, how this dash is so stupid or doesn\u2019t know what he/she is doing or gossiping and badmouthing other drivers. There are many others that would love to be in a leadership position, making the higher hourly pay and taking their job seriously. Lastly, it seems that new drivers are not being trained as they should be, as notable by the questions they post on discord. I would like to suggest a different way to do a ride-along.

I've been doing it full time since April 2018. I routinely make over $600 per week driving for Waitr. I take home anywhere between $450 - $550 per week. I do have to buy gas and that's about $60 -$70 per week, and there is no reimbursement either. However, there are no jobs in my area that still can beat a take-home check (after gas) of anywhere around $380-$450 and more per week. On top of that, I don't have to deal with a lame work place environment, sorry bosses or take a mandatory 15 minute break or forced to take a mandatory (waste of time) one hour lunch break. I typically work 8AM - 2PM & 3PM - 9PM, Friday, Saturday and Sunday and enjoy having FOUR DAYS OFF to do whatever and still make an awesome paycheck! I've worked jobs in the past that were so lame that I've called in sick because the job totally sucked! I've never woke up and thought to myself, \" I'm not going into work today.\" I spend my day meeting interesting people and listening to Sirius XM while I average $15 - $21 per hour.

That being said, so many employees get into accidents and it puts an alarming amount of mileage on your car. People just don't often tip you very well so you are out there hoping that they will tip you and a large amount of your check goes to paying for so much gas since they do not conpensate you for gas. It is a scam that they say you make $20/hour, not true at all. I've worked here for five months and the pay has been less than what you would even get at a minimum wage job (worse, because you're paying for all of your gas). Management is extremely unprofessional. I got into an accident and continued working after it happened and my manager didn't even know I was still working there! I am a fulltime Lead! At another time, I was set up to train a new driver and my manager swapped me so someone else could train them but he never even communicated that to me. He never answered my messages when I asked about when I would be given my raise for becoming a fulltime employee. Said he was \"capped\" and could not pay me what I was promised to be paid yet.

They keep the minimum people on and don\u2019t care if orders are late. They think that as long as you send them a message, all is well. They treat the customers and employees terrible while they sit in an office in Louisiana and have no idea how a market actually is. The DASHES are incompetent people who most likely couldn\u2019t get a different job and constantly treat the drivers horribly. City managers aren\u2019t much better. It\u2019s a stressful work environment and they still don\u2019t think you\u2019re \u201cefficient\u201d enough. They constantly talk about how much money you\u2019re making, but you don\u2019t make anything unless someone tips well. It\u2019s not worth it. You get benefits if you work full time, but working any other job would be significantly better. They talk about how you schedule yourself and are your own boss, but you\u2019ll never get the shifts you want and theyv recently made scheduling even worse than it already was. During lunch rushes, they have very few people including and constantly ask people to jump on or stay late. You\u2019ll never be scheduled for when uou\u2019re Supposed to be. They\u2019re extremely unhelpful and look down on you, when you\u2019re the whole reason they\u2019re able to sit aroun.

The good thing about working for waitr is it is pretty flexible with how much you work. Only contingency is you need to schedule a weekend day, and have at least 15-20 hours a week scheduled. There are about 6 different shifts for each day, and schedules are released 3 weeks in advance. The typical shift ranges fom 4-6 hours. The other good thing is you can take off up to 2 weeks off at a time, as long as you tell your manager ahead of time. Now, the cons for working for this company are that you don\u2019t get compensated for gas or mileage. So, the more you work, the more gas you have to put into your car. I would only recommend this job to someone with a fuel efficient car. When i first started this job, it was great. I was making good tips, constantly getting orders, and havigg fun making deliveries. However, once summer hit, the orders started slowing down, and they hired a LOT more drivers. So instead of getting 7-10 deliveries per shift, i was getting 3-6 per shift. There were SOME orders, however they were 30+ minutes away, and jm not going to waste my gas for 1 order. The last thing that could be improved on are the dash representatives. Most of them are nice and friendly, however with all the new hires, some of them assign you orders that are out of your way, and don\u2019t even notify you in the chat like they are supposed to. Overall, it is a good job if you are ready to grind.

Asked Apr 24, 2017 Consolidate three (3) applications into one. Make the dispatching process transparent. We are told ATOM assigns drivers, but we hear leaks from employees that dispatchers pick and choose drivers. Also, use more realistic delivery time estimates and don\u2019t assign orders to one person that are very far from one another. The restaurants may be close in proximity, but the customers can be 20 miles apart. How are we expected to make those deliveries on time? It\u2019s almost impossible. Treat your drivers better and design software that plans your route/delivery automatically, instead of us spending 2-5 minutes deciding ourselves which order is the least late. Answered Mar 25, 2020 Allow drivers to make double orders without the dispatch's permission. Stop texting me and calling me whem i am driving. Make it mandatory to alert police if a person's home smells like a dope den. Stop sending me to the orojects because if they are on public assistance they cant afford to have deliveries frequently.

Mostly everyone gets along and isn't rude. There are times, though, when we have a DASH member be lowkey rude. If anyone is rude, it's usually the restaurant employees, but it isn't often enough to be a problem. You get to drive around with your own music and no managers yelling at you (lol). As long as you pay attention to all your apps, you'll be fine. It gets hectic whenever it's busy, but most of the time it's not busy and you can chill. Answered Jul 7, 2019 Who gets the tip from customers business employees or waiter employees? Asked Aug 27, 2017 The employee is not shown what their tips are except for an end of the day total. So clearly there is a lot of room for dishonesty. Answered Jun 11, 2020 For sure at least 3% of all tips get taken from the driver. For whatever reason because the independent contract agreement says nothing about paying for credit card fees so I'm assuming they are they taking a small percentage for the company. Answered Apr 10, 2020 If you were in charge, what would you do to make Waitr Inc a better place to work? Asked Jun 3, 2019 I would take away the ability of the dispatch to see how much a customer has tipped and to see who they are assigning orders to. Because Waitr has just converted to 1099 drivers the dispatch has the ability to see who they are sending the orders to and they will send the better tip orders to their favorite people. That has caused a lot of good drivers to quit. Answered Jun 8, 2020 Pay the employees fairly and hourly more than 5 bucks an hour Answered May 29, 2020"
