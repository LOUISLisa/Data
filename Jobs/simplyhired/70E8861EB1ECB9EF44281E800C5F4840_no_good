- HORRIBLE place to work!! I can say that, as a very well-seasoned and successful salesperson, that Carmax provides excellent training and a very thoroughly tested and refined process for the discovery, progression and closing aspects of a customer interaction, throughout the sales process. Unfortunately, where they fall on their face is just about everywhere else! To be fair, I am referring specifically to Naples and SWFL stores, so things may be a little different in other locations, due, in large part, to the very seasonal nature of our market. Having said that, I firmly believe that Carmax's approach to \"Commission-Only\" compensation is categorically anemic, unfair, underwhelming, and is misrepresented at the very interview, when hired. It will take a long time (years) to earn a decent salary and not have to work every day -- all day! This compensation is structure is also completely and utterly at odds with it's highly touted \"culture of integrity\" that it promotes with all of it's associates, especially those in sales. This is because it foments the frustrations and motivations-by-desperation of an otherwise successful salesperson (earning commision-only) having to depend on all of the other apathetic departments, staffed by lackluster associates. Moreover, these associates, who are supposed to move the product (a used car) though the process and out the door, have absolutely no sense of urgency or performance initiative, other than just to get through the day and earn their own mini...more ProsGood Sales-Training, Product and Process. Customers are generally happy by the end. ConsHorrible compensation and work/life balance. WAY too much micro-management. A Corporate Minefield 1.0 Sales Consultant | Baton Rouge, LA | Feb 6, 2020 Misleading and Inconsiderate Initially Sales Consultants were allotted 3 hours in \"e-office\" where consultants would accept \"random\" leads from potential car buyers. Afterwards we would work the floor and assist walking customers for another 6 hours. You were allowed 45mins for lunch but you are not urged to take a lunch. They rather you work 9hours straight which we would consequently have to do in order to have a chance at making a reasonable amount of commission. The position is commission based with subsidy for Full-Time associates. Consultants are not paid a percentage of the vehicle price only a flat unit rate of $160.00 per unit. There is opportunity to reach a higher tear maxing at $200 per unit but it is comprehensive and you can easily fall back to the first tier. For example, if a consultant is not able to make any commission during a 2 week period they would receive a check based on the average of hours they worked that pay period at a rate of 7.25. This averages to about $500. The catch is once you make commissions the following pay period you have to pay the $500 back from the pay period before. So essentially its legalized share cropping. To add to that, if a customer ever decides to return a car within the 7day return policy, your commission is taken away no matter the reason (I just didn't like it or... it drives funny at 60mph) for return and without regard to what commissions you accumulated afterwards. Managers would make some effort to inform you of a return but many times...more ProsAccess to wholesale vehicle purchased from walking customers before they leave for auction ConsPay, Work-Life Balance, Unethical/Unscrupulous managerial practices 2.0 Senior Sales Consultant | San Antonio, TX | Mar 25, 2015 Lack of Leadership When I first started Carmax in 2004 I was very impressed with how well the company was run and felt good about the company's value and integrity. I thoroughly believed in the product and felt good about what I was doing. In recent years, Carmax has changed the quality standards on the cars and is not better than any other used car lot, may be even worse in some cases. It has become so corporate that their policies are getting in the way of selling cars and offering a quality product. Service after the sale is horrible and a lot of times it reflects on you. You are at the mercy of people that get paid by the hour and do not care if you are losing money because of them and do not treat the customer with the same importance that you do. As a Sales Associate, you are 100% commission but you are not the only person controlling your paycheck. There will be times when you have to either lose half a deal or come in on your day off because someone else didn't do their job correctly. I was also at a store where the women are treated like second class citizens and not looked at as leaders, which goes against Carmax's culture. If a woman speaks up or acts as an equal, they are looked at as if they are doing something wrong. I was constantly harassed by a sales manager there for 6-7 years because his idea of \"respect\" is to cower to him. He was constantly trying to get me fired after he asked me to be his boyfriend and I ignored him. The store is also very cliquish and if you a...more ProsBenefits, good intentions from corporate Consthere can be great variations of leadership from store to store 2.0 Associate | Albuquerque, NM | Oct 23, 2012 Keep your head down at CarMax... reality is harsh. This company is very confusing. They claim to be about the employees and have a culture of communication and respect. I found this to be true - if you're a manager. Typically an average employee is better seen - working very had to appear busy even when it's a slow day, rather than heard. The company won't listen to any input that isn't from upper/senior management and treats you like another cog in the used-car profit making machine. Which is fine except they act like this job is a blessing and will make you rich and successful if you just put your heart and soul into it. I've seen people do just that, which just earns them extra stress, MAYBE a pat on the back, but definitely no pay raise. Turnover is extremely high for both my department and the technicians. This was during a time of economic downturn folks, when people are desperate for work mind you. The management is so abusive and the work environment so demeaning that employees will do anything they can to get out. The management can be heard trash talking employees from every department when they meet in their office at all hours and pretend to have a \"meeting\". I have seen and heard this. The company will spend thousands of dollars on sending in they're so called \"experts\" that tell us inefficient and downright WRONG ways to perform our job, yet try their best to hold back on promotions and benefits despite the used car sector experiencing growth and record profits.

Some Sales Consultants would frequent the UPs list and some would try and stay away from it. Job has too many rules and requirements of Consultants that it becomes stressful really, really fast. You may see a Consultant one day, and they're gone the next. Management- Most of them were inexperienced as Managers and seemed to be either overwhelmed or on edge all of the time. Blames Consultants when sales numbers aren't being met, but takes credit when they are. Talks about Consultants behind their backs which creates a weird tension between management and consultants. If your numbers are a bit low, even if the traffic is down for that time you are blamed for it and threatened to be put on a ridiculous program that is just their way of scaring you and preparing you to possibly be let go at some point. They claim people don't get fired often, but at least 5 Consultants were fired in the few months I was there. The training program is ludicrous and takes 30 days before you go \"live\" watching other consultants sell things like an extended service plan(which they track your sales vigorously on). They claim that they don't want you to be a pushy car salesman, but that is a ruse. They absolutely do, and when they think you may have a potential sale, they will make you pull out all of the stops on the customer which is in fact, pushy.

The values and culture are the foundation of what CarMax has become : The largest auto retailer in the nation. Employees used to be their main asset. A lot has changed lately. There are a LOT of meetings that you don't get paid for. Attending a meeting on your day of is not mandatory, but is \"appreciated\". In other words, you are expected to show up. Every morning and Sunday, there is a training that IS mandatory. You do not get paid for this time. Most of this training is endless repetition, up to the point where every one will feel like a little kid. Overkill is an understatement. If you don't like role plays, CarMax is not for you. Advancement to management ( is promised over and over again to all that are interested ) is sheer impossible. It is easier to enter management from outside the company than from within. Before you are eligible to a promotion, management will give you unrealistic goals to achieve and re-adjust those goals even if you have reached them. Work / Life balance : If you want to sell a lot of cars, you better be there 7 days a week. Customers will call you on your time off and you better answer these calls if you want to keep the sale. You can make a reasonable living working 5 days a week, but usually only during summer time. Work weeks of 55 hours are no exception. Not every CarMax store is the same.

For all this time Carmax has provided me a fun and productive workplace; I am certainly grateful for the opportunity to work here and for the skills I have learned. It is important to me that there is a social component to the work I do; I enjoy relating to and interacting with people. Carmax has provided such a friendly and supportive environment. While I feel that I have received a professional education here, the main thing that is missing \u2013 to me \u2013 is stability and certainty. I have a young family to support and encourage; it would be nice to work in a field where, at the end of each day, I can feel that I was successful in a product-oriented sort of way and that the office I work in is a better for the work I have done. My typical workday starts at 9am with a morning \u201chuddle\u201d where my boss and my team make plans for the day, the next day, the week and the month. Next, I am either on the phone with or emailing my customers, scheduling appointments with them and encouraging a sale. After these tasks, I greet new walk-in clients and provide them with world-class customer service. Carmax has been a great company to work for: throughout the day I practice teamwork and the ethic that is part of the culture here at Carmax; I plan my business day in the morning and during the day, I communicate with various departments and managers at all levels.

Consthe inherent instability of car sales 3.0 Accounts Payable Clerk | Richmond, VA | Nov 14, 2014 Fun company, challenging work, great people, but... I've worked in accounting for more than 5, but less than 10 years. The fun culture, friendly people, flexible hours and casual dress code have made CarMax's corporate office a comfortable, mostly enjoyable, place to work. The company is highly invested in maintaining a favorable reputation in the communities surrounding their stores, and in the national media. There's a lot of emphasis internally, on CarMax being and remaining one of Fortune's \"100 Great Places to Work\". The pride and enthusiasm expressed by representatives of the company had a lot to do with me deciding to accept a position there. I think CarMax's overall mission and concepts are great and they do an awesome job of making the company look great from the outside. From the inside, I have to say say that it's not that pretty. There are many layers of management. Inconsistent and sometimes unrealistic expectations have led to poor employee morale. For example, one accounting manager might require biweekly written performance evaluations, while another might do quarterly check-ins. The unlucky employee has to sell himself verbally and in writing twice a month, while the guy with the reasonable manager can concentrate on meeting his deadlines. Advancement opportunities are scarce, for non management employees. The internal application process is, for lack of a better term, shady. Experience, skills and performance don't seem to factor much into which employee is ultimately selected for the coveted, el...more ProsWork/life balance, schedule flexibility, casual dress code, fun culture ConsExcessive performance evaluations, tiny pay raises regardless of job performance, promotion highly unlikely regardless of job performance, company more concerned with having positive outward appearance than taking care of its employees 3.0 Sales Consultant | Oxnard, CA | Jun 25, 2020 Production side: Good, Sales side: Less good Carmax was probably one of the best dealerships to work at IF you worked behind the scenes-the mechanics, inventory, and service writers all seemed pretty happy and generally stuck around. For sales consultants, the business office, and even the buyers office to some extent however, it was high turnover and often high stress. And despite this common struggle with these departments, the dynamics between the buyers/sales/business office was often strained, and each office was often very resistant to providing any extra help to one another. Work life balance was very difficult to come by. While W/L balance was preached by the sales (micro) managers, you'd regularly get the call from those same sales managers giving you the choice of either coming in on your day off for what was an assuredly hour or more ordeal, or splitting your hard earned commission in half with another consultant because a car or customer showed up unexpectedly. As a result most if not all consultants were working 10,20, 30 hours of overtime every week. There was also a conflict of interest at times, where a customer would have been perfectly fine coming in when a consultant is scheduled, but a manager would take the initiative and schedule a showing with buyers on your day off because they were trying to hit the sales goal and bonus for that day, which is ridiculous. Now that all sounds bad, but after it all I can still genuinely say that I'm glad I worked at Carmax- ...more ProsGood training, generally supportive management, they will promote you (for better or worse) from within if you can sell.

Lie 2: we care about our employee's, this one especially makes me laugh all management cares about is numbers and furthering the growth of the consultants they favor if you are not lucky enough to be taken to lunch daily by your manager or even invited to their house on days off to \"hang\" you are not their favorite and will be treated like a child with constant unessisary and time consuming daily observations for everything you do wrong but never told how to do it right. Lie 3: growth, as explained above growth is only given to manager favorited opportunities are rare and few managers will say the tip performers are given opportunities do to numbers but I think everyone would sell well if manages were closing their deals for them too.

Asked Jan 24, 2017 Very time consuming, with several one on ones with different managers asking different behavioral type questions ending in a role play. Seems like a waste of time with such a high turn over with the company. Answered Feb 15, 2020 Phone Interview: Lasted about 30 minutes There was at least 8 behavioral based questions They require you answer using the STAR method On Site Interview: Interviewed with 2 Office Managers 10 Behavioral based questions again MUST be answered using the STAR method. This portion of the interview lasted 1 1/2. I was then asked to go back in the lobby and wait. I waited about 15 minutes before another manager came out and introduced himself. We went back into the conference room and another behavioral interview was conducted another 10 questions. Again MUST answer using STAR method. They will stop you and ask you to start over if you do not follow the STAR method. The second interview lasted another 1 1/2. In total I spent over 3 hours at the onsite interview. After the first few questions it can become redundant and it becomes hard to stay focused. Answered Dec 30, 2019 How are health benefits Asked Nov 13, 2016 Health benefits after 30 days.
