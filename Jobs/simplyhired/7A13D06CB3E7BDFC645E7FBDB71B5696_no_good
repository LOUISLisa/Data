The compensation was really good. 2.0 Director | New York, NY | Jul 16, 2019 Very poor work/life balance Leadership does not value its people and sets unrealistic and often competing expectations and priorities. Excessive abuse of personal time to schedule off hour and weekend meetings with no regard for impact it has on families. 4.0 Analytics Consultant | New York, NY | Aug 4, 2015 Good place to grow Typical BPO company - long hours, solid analytics training, exposure to client. Benefits are ok, promotion based on performance. 5.0 Head Custodian | Springfield, MO | Aug 10, 2013 Fun place to work. A place to learn, work, and grow. The work is easy. You get to meet new people. ProsThey work with you. ConsNo benifits. 5.0 Subject Matter Expert | Lee's Summit, MO | Jul 18, 2019 Fun Place to work Really enjoyed the experience. Management went out of there way to shake things up for the associates so that it wasn't the same thing everyday. Management was also easy to talk to about issues with the systems, or other colleagues. 5.0 Analytics Manager | New York, NY | Jun 23, 2015 Very good company to get exceptional experience.

I learned a lot about Indian culture. Management was great, very helpful. Our workplace culture was fun at times. we would organize potlucks, bowling trips etc....The hardest part of the job was the under staffing. There were not enough CSR's to handle our call volume, The most enjoyable part of the job was the fun things we would do together as a team ( contests etc...)

Questions And Answers about EXL How do you feel about going to work each day at EXL? Asked Jan 2, 2017 I didn't mind going in some days, but other days I had to force myself. However, I LOVED the people I worked with & looked forward to seeing them each day which made it easier to go to work. Answered Apr 29, 2019 EXL has a HORRIBLE turn over & can not keep employees. During the 6 months I worked there I seen their entire day crew leave this company except a handful of people. When this happened they put the work load off on the evening crew. They lost these employees due to poor management & they were being sent home everyday about the time our crew came onto the call floor which was between 12pm & 2pm. This in turn left their checks short. So, EXL's future seems very shaky & unstable. Answered Apr 29, 2019 What is the most stressful part about working at EXL? Asked Dec 11, 2018 The environment Answered Jan 8, 2020 The people who run it Answered Jan 1, 2020 How are the working hours at EXL? Asked Nov 26, 2016 The have basic schedule hours like 8am - 5pm but most new people don't get these hours. Generally the new people must work hours like 12pm-9pm as was my shift. Due to my hours it prevented my other half from finding a job since we only had 1 vehicle & nobody would allow him to take off work in middle of the day just to run me to work. Answered Apr 29, 2019 9 hour's shift and 1 hour of break. Answered Jan 25, 2019 How did you feel about telling people you worked at EXL? Asked Nov 24, 2016 I didn't have an issue with telling people where I worked, but I was honestly an Aerotek employee working at EXL as a temp. Answered Apr 29, 2019 It is an embarrassment to tell people I have worked for this company. The greater Kansas City area only knows this call center as a bad one. Other employers have told me to remove them from my resume because having them as experience doesn't show anything positive. When people hear EXL it is all negative Answered Apr 11, 2019 Why does this company have such a high turn around of employees? Asked Sep 14, 2018 Bad management Answered Jan 5, 2020 Company does not treat their employees well. They want production but they don't want to pay anyone overtime, and pay is awful. The weekly bonus is such a joke. They act like $100 is so rewarding. You territory will change, and you may not get any work. That saves money on expenses. It is a cheap company. The leadership is so bad. Anyone that is quality in management is often fired for sticking up for their people. Now, you have managers who lie about their staff, don't sign expenses as a punishment and do everything to mistreat people Answered Dec 21, 2018"
