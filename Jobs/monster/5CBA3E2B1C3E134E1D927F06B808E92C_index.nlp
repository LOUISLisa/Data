    "Body": " 5G Wireless Networking Engineer at Noblis Reston, VA ???????????? About the Job Program Overview: ???????????? The Network Modeling and Analysis program supports telecommunications network modeling and analysis, to ensure required performance of government traffic, especially focusing on priority telecommunications needs in an all-hazards environment. In addition, data analytics related to a user\u2019s range of access technologies (such as WiFi, 4G/5G), multimedia applications (audio, video, image, text), and 5G human / machine interactions through Internet of Things (IoT) must be incorporated. During emergencies or crisis situations, wireless and wireline networks can experience congestion due to increased call volumes and/or damage to network facilities, hindering the ability of public safety and national security and emergency preparedness personnel to complete emergency calls. ????????????Government programs provide priority access and prioritized processing in cellular and wireline networks for these key personnel, greatly increasing the probability of call completion. ???????????? The public network ecosystems providing priority telecommunication programs are undergoing a technology transformation, along with an explosion in traffic demand, new use-cases, and vertical industries that will compete with priority traffic and provide new government use-case requirements. Noblis assistance to the government through modeling and analysis of the network infrastructure during congestion and disaster scenarios is essential in the new technology environment to evaluate potential performance issues and adapt priority mechanisms to new network protocols.???????????? This modeling and analysis is an important part of government acquisition policy and can also influence standards development. ???????????? Role Description:???????????? ???????????? Serve as a technical subject matter expert (SME) either leading or serving on high-performing teams in engineering, modeling, analysis, and testing of IT / telecommunications network solutions, in particular 4G LTE/5G wireless technologies, supporting government agencies. Apply education, training or experience in wireless telecommunications technologies, services or protocols, especially 4G LTE/ 5G, and their use for mobile voice and broadband data / video, Internet of Things (IoT), secure cloud connection, and Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) applications. Contribute to solutions that integrate these wireless applications into enterprise solutions with other synergistic telecommunications concepts and technologies, such as Software-Defined Wide Area Networking (SD-WAN), IP Multiprotocol Label Switching (IP-MPLS), and zero trust networking with network segmentation. ???????????? Develop modeling and analysis relating to wireless technologies, including analyzing the effectiveness of network use of alternative National Security / Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) priority treatments. Research the relevant standards and collaborate with internal and stakeholder team to develop an understanding of system of interest and define model. Develop discrete-event simulation models using custom simulation code. Develop code to statistically analyze and visualize simulation output. Research and develop white papers on the impact of emerging technologies on performance of special classes of network traffic. Develop architecture and algorithms to extract useful information from heterogeneous data incorporating a range of access technologies (such as WiFi, 4G/5G), multimedia applications (audio, video, image, text), and 5G human / machine interactions through Internet of Things (IoT). Hypothesize and model alternative system configurations to determine effectiveness, tradeoffs, and resiliency of alternative approaches.???????????? Construct model scenarios and structure model input parameters; perform statistical analysis of model outputs and characterize input probability distributions. Develop analytics to assist in validation of simulation results. Work with project team throughout review assumptions, validate results, and document and present results to project team and the government.
