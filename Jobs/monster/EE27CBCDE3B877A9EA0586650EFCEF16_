    "Body": " Technical Lead at Cisco Boxborough, MA ???????????? About the Job What You'll Do Develop and manage test automation for Contact Center solutions. Who You'll Work With High energy engineering team distributed around the world, focused on delivering innovative features with speed and quality. Who You Are Minimum Requirements: * 3+ years test automation * 3+ years experience with Jenkins * 3+ years experience (e.g. Perl, Bash, Python or Powershell) * 3+ years experience with VmWare technology Desired Skills/Qualifications/System Experience requirements: * Previous experience setting up and managing Cisco Unified CCE installations * Experience with load and performance testing, and associated monitoring * Working knowledge of Docker Why Cisco #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here\u2019s how we do it. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we\u2019re \"old\" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we\u2019re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can\u2019t put us in a box! But \"Digital Transformation\" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don\u2019t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That\u2019s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!
