Oracle provides essential elements for companies to pioneer innovations and drive new business models. For example, applications based on artificial intelligence (AI) can suggest the next best actions, automate answers, and provide personalized service. Oracle embeds machine learning into several management and security offerings to help monitor, troubleshoot, and predict potential outages and security breaches. We enable automated but personalized interactions across our applications via digital assistants-and we've integrated AI into analytics to help discover hidden patterns. Oracle helps customers develop roadmaps, migrate to the cloud, and take advantage of emerging technologies from any point: new cloud deployments, on-premises environments, and hybrid implementations. Oracle's approach makes it easy for companies to get started in the cloud and even easier to expand as business grows. **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure:** Oracle set an ambitious goal in building its second-generation cloud infrastructure: to create an infrastructure that matches and surpasses the performance, control and governance of enterprise datacenters, while delivering the scale, elasticity, and cost-savings of public clouds. The result, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, is built from the ground up to be an Enterprise Cloud, equally capable of running traditional multi-tiered enterprise applications, high-performance workloads, and modern serverless and container-based architectures. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure serves as the foundational layer for Oracle Autonomous Database, as well as for Oracle's platform and application services. It is a second-generation cloud infrastructure designed to run any enterprise application and workload securely in the cloud. In a single offering, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure combines the flexibility and cost benefits of a public cloud with the predictability and control of an on-premises environment.
