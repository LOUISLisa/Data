    "Body": " Radar Engineer II* at Odyssey Systems Lexington, MA Â  About the Job The Surveillance Systems Group conducts research on integrated sensing and decision support architectures for Air Traffic Control. The group is currently performing research and development into the impact of new generations of secondary surveillance systems on the National Airspace System (NAS), with two major approaches. In the initial approach, the Project Team is analyzing system architecture, implementation, and operational use concepts to assess the impacts of proposed new systems on the NAS. The results of this research are analyses used by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to determine the effects that the proposed new systems would have on the performance of already-deployed NAS systems. The Group is also developing a suite of simulation tools to assess the impact of new or modified systems on the National Airspace System in a high\u2014fidelity simulated environment, called the NAS Surveillance Framework (NSF). When complete, the NSF will include software models of all surveillance elements of the NAS, as well as the safety systems that operate in that surveillance environment. The NSF will be used to assess new systems impacts quantitatively in a secure simulation environment. A radar engineer is needed to support the System Development team in the development and analysis of surveillance architectures that will span areas related to safe, efficient, and secure air traffic surveillance, situation assessment, and collision avoidance for conventional and unmanned aircraft. The successful candidate will support analyses of proposed new sensors and in the development of the NSF, as well as support NSF results to assess the impact of new surveillance systems on the NAS prior to actual operation in the NAS. Activities will include participation in surveillance systems analyses, system modeling, simulation, and data analysis. Candidates should have general knowledge in the fields of electro-magnetic theory, probability theory and software development. Candidates must possess the skills to analyze operational problems in detail and to develop deployable solutions. Additional activities will include participation in test planning, data collection and flight test operations, as well as analysis and presentation of field test data. The successful candidate will use a variety of tools such as MATLAB and Java/C++ and will work as part of a team. RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES Support other NSF and ACAS X systems analysis and development personnel to assess the impacts of proposed new surveillance systems, specify models of surveillance systems for simulation, and participate in the implementation and testing of the NSF. The assignment includes module and system tests to ensure proper implementation. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS \u2022 Must be a U.S. citizen with the ability to obtain and maintain an active DoD secret clearance \u2022 MS in Electrical Engineering or physics with a minimum of three years of directly related experience; or BS in EE or physics with a minimum of five years of directly related experience. \u2022 secondary (beacon) surveillance system architecture and design; \u2022 digital signal processing and target tracking; \u2022 automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast (ADS-B systems; \u2022 airborne collision avoidance systems; \u2022 specifying, developing, and verifying models and simulations; \u2022 specifying and developing real-time surveillance data processing and visualization tools \u2022 specifying computer systems architecture and design for real-time data collection and archiving. PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS \u2022 Active Secret Clearance \u2022 familiarity with air traffic surveillance and control \u2022 analysis script development in MATLAB \u2022 familiarity with parallel processing and inter-process communication \u2022 design and coding using object-oriented programming languages such as java and C/C++ \u2022 developing, debugging, and executing software in Windows and Linux environments \u2022 source code and version control management, with revision control systems such as SVN or Git \u2022 the agile software engineering process.
