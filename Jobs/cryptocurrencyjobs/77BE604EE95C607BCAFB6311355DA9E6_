Players will be able to monetize the time and effort they\u2019ve invested in playing by buying and selling NFTs using the \u201cSAND\u201d token, which is the official currency in The Sandbox. This utility token offers multiple uses that will empower players through community voting, staking mechanisms, crowdfunding, and decentralized governance. Our journey on The Sandbox just hit a new milestone as we have raised a $2.5M investment round led by Hashed, the largest crypto assets fund and accelerator in South Korea and partnered with Kakao\u2019s Klaytn to reach mass distribution in Korea.
