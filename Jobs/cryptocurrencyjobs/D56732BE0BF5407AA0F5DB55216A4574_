Search blockchain jobs Stability Labs We make digital money safe, stable and accessible DApp Developer Berlin Â· Remote Â· Engineering Â· Full-Time Date posted: 27 Jan 2020 Stability Labs is building mStable - the Stable Asset Standard for Open Finance. Built on Ethereum, mStable is a decentralised platform for scalable and risk minimised stable assets that unites the fragmented stablecoin economy into radically more stable and secure digital assets. Our core development team is in Germany and successful applicants will ideally join us on site in Berlin. If that isn\u2019t possible, you can work remotely and we can get together for on boarding and regular offsites. After raising two rounds of funding, the project aims to publicly launch in January 2020 and be on mainnet in Q2 2020. We are backed by some of the largest players in cryptocurrency (some of which are not announced publicly). Given that we are relatively early stage (pre-launch), core team members have the opportunity to be incentivised through an attractive allocation of our system token Meta (a token which has similarities to MKR and SNX). Risk minimised and scalable stable assets are the foundation of a robust DeFi stack. Our mission is to build this stable asset standard, making digital money safe, stable and accessible.

Developing back-ends for mStable involves creating APIs and services that extract data from and interact with the Ethereum network. As a core mStable engineer you will work closely with our engineering team while taking real ownership over your work - both your open source code and the resulting applications will be visible and utilised in the heart of DeFi. Our current front-end stack is centered around React, Context API and Web3js/Ethers however as an early engineer you will play a key role in architecting the system and as such are free to propose the best tools for the job.
