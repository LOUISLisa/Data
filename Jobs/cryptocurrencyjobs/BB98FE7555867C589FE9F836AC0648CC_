We have upgradeable proxy contracts, an automated custom deploy process that includes all of our dApps and tooling, and \u200bover 90 contracts to manage\u200b (based off of over a dozen key source files). Moreover, we\u2019re in the process of migrating towards a ProtocolDAO that will automate and protect system upgrades even further. For more detail on our setup, please see \u200bhttps://docs.synthetix.io/contracts/ Candidate Is Happy to work remote and manage their own office environment Open to full-time contract work Willing to be available outside regular 9-5 hours to respond to questions / queries internally Willing to make time each week (2-3hrs) for video calls with the rest of the team or CTO Willing to travel 3-4 times per year to join the team at conferences or offsites (10 day maximum travel time per trip) Intellectually curious and enjoys collaborating with peers Candidate Has Solid demonstrable work (on GitHub or otherwise) with Solidity code - a minimum of 12 months Has contracts on Ethereum mainnet that have handled non-trivial amount of funds Experience with Solidity security audits (as an author or recipient) Synthetix Will Pay in ETH, SNX or stablecoins (or a combination) Pay for travel expenses to aforementioned conferences & offsites Ensure your code is professionally audited Make you feel welcome!
