The current design revolves around a trustless Bitcoin-Polkadot bridge that will serve as the main gateway for bringing Bitcoin liquidity into Polkadot\u2019s ecosystem. Polkadot, developed by Parity Technologies and the Web3 Foundation, is one of the industry\u2019s flagship blockchains and has raised over USD 150 million. The underlying framework follows a detailed specification and is based on the XCLAIM paper, published at the top-tier security conference IEEE S&P. In parallel, we are building a trustless & non-custodial trading platform for cross-chain derivatives, with a focus on Bitcoin. Your task will be to design and build the web-based user interface using React and TypeScript for (i) the cross-chain communication framework and (ii) the trustless trading platform. Thereby, you will connect the frontend to the Polkadot and Ethereum blockchains via REST/RPC, and design usable integrations into Bitcoin (web) wallets. You will need to have an excellent understanding of React and TypeScript best practices and experience with writing production-ready software (incl. E2E testing). Experience with development in blockchain-based environments is strongly encouraged, as you will need a basic understanding of the underlying technology to build user flows and simplify interactions without loss of security.
