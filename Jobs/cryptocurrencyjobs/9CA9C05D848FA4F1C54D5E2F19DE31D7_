Built on Ethereum, mStable is a decentralised platform for scalable and risk minimised stable assets that unites the fragmented stablecoin economy into radically more stable and secure digital assets. Our core development team is in Germany and successful applicants will ideally join us on site in Berlin. If that isn\u2019t possible, you can work remotely and we can get together for on boarding and regular offsites. After raising two rounds of funding, the project aims to publicly launch in January 2020 and be on mainnet in Q2 2020. We are backed by some of the largest players in cryptocurrency (some of which are not announced publicly). Given that we are relatively early stage (pre-launch), core team members have the opportunity to be incentivised through an attractive allocation of our system token Meta (a token which has similarities to MKR and SNX). Risk minimised and scalable stable assets are the foundation of a robust DeFi stack. Our mission is to build this stable asset standard, making digital money safe, stable and accessible.

These traits are unfortunately not common in cryptocurrency but are fundamental to the success of DeFi and its ability to scale to billions of users. The mStable Standard reflects these characteristics; it is a critical missing primitive to the emerging DeFi stack.
