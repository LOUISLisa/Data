As the creators of the Elastic Stack, we help thousands of organizations including Cisco, eBay, Grab, Goldman Sachs, ING, Microsoft, NASA, The New York Times, Wikipedia, and many more use Elastic to power mission-critical systems. From stock quotes to Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs, our products are extending what\u2019s possible with data, delivering on the promise that good things come from connecting the dots. We have a distributed team of Elasticians across 30+ countries (and counting), and our diverse open source community spans over 100 countries. Learn more at elastic.co The Observability team is in charge of developing solutions that focus on application developers and engineers that run infrastructure and services supporting these applications. Elasticsearch is an efficient datastore for logs, metrics, and application traces, supporting the three pillars of observability. The Observability team builds and maintains solutions that make getting insights from this data turnkey and efficient, such as our APM, Metrics, Logs and Uptime solutions. When developing these solutions, we think about the problem end-to-end: how do we automatically collect data from common data sources, how do we store it efficiently in Elasticsearch, how do we present this information to the user, what actions do we take on the insights from the data? All of these aspects are important in bringing a turnkey solution to the market. As a Team Lead, you will have the opportunity to lead a team of developers and work with the Product Manager and Tech Lead to evolve our Uptime product into a full Synthetic Monitoring solution. This includes the ability to monitor webpages and user journeys in a real browser as well as other platforms in the future, capture key metrics and data points and then leverage that information to solve the problems facing our customers. In addition to managing, mentoring and leading a globally distributed team, your initial responsibilities would include working with your team to define the greenfield technical approach that will support the real browser testing engine, how the data is stored, how to facilitate integrations with our powerful stack-wide components (ie Machine Learning) and enabling an efficient technical path from MVP to production solution. The team is diverse and distributed across the world, and collaborates on a daily basis over GitHub, Zoom, and Slack. Thus, the ability to work within a distributed team is critical. You don\u2019t always need to be the person with the answer or the person making the decisions, but instead should be able to guide discussions to help the team make decisions together. What you will be doing Manage, mentor and lead a globally distributed team. Evolve our current offering from Uptime monitoring to Synthetic monitoring. Lead the efficient delivery for time-boxed software releases, ensuring high quality and innovative feature development Work with our Product Management team to define requirements Foster a culture of mutual respect, collaboration and consensus based decision-making Stay true to the principles of software development as adopted by our team Build roadmaps and lead prioritization; balance the right amount of structure and planning for a fast-paced engineering team Identify resource requirements and help drive recruitment of high quality colleagues Support the development and training of direct reports through regular performance evaluations Be an awesome person to work with, somebody who sincerely empathizes with others What you will bring along Degree in Computer Science or equivalent software engineering experience Experience leading distributed teams of software engineers (people manager, tech lead) Experience as a hands-on software engineer so you understand the core principles of the engineering work that is going on in your team A compassionate approach to communication, a good sense of humour, and a genuine interest in the success and growth of the people you work with Experience with monitoring solutions, especially around Synthetic Monitoring.
