As the creators of the Elastic Stack, we help thousands of organizations including Cisco, eBay, Grab, Goldman Sachs, ING, Microsoft, NASA, The New York Times, Wikipedia, and many more use Elastic to power mission-critical systems. From stock quotes to Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs, our products are extending what\u2019s possible with data, delivering on the promise that good things come from connecting the dots. We have a distributed team of Elasticians across 30+ countries (and counting), and our diverse open source community spans over 100 countries. Learn more at elastic.co Imagine a search experience which connects you to all of your favourite online applications. The experience ingests data via third-party connectors for applications like GitHub, Google Drive, and more, processes your natural language, then sends queries to Elasticsearch, the leading RESTful search engine for fast, relevant search results at scale. We\u2019re seeking a talented software engineer and communicator to help us realize this vision and weave together our expanding library of connectors. What You Will Be Doing: You will work with modern workplace tools to create a reliable foundation for third-party connectors like GitHub, Google Drive, Confluence, and many more. Each connector has its own needs. But they\u2019ll share a lot, too! You\u2019ll need to balance when to share and standardize logic and when to separate it, when to have the source open and when to have it closed. You will help define our overall strategy for connectors, collaborating on a product roadmap and then breaking it into technical deliverables. You\u2019ll act as an essential and communicative part of an engaged and spirited team. Our Team Style: We appreciate articulate and \u201clow ego\u201d people who want to grow as part of a team. We welcome diversity in all forms, thought above all. We embrace strange and risky ideas and appreciate characters of all sorts. We hold each other accountable and work to a high standard. We take pride in the frequent, safe and graceful delivery of innovative and valuable features. We embrace open communication and challenge. We appreciate positivity and vigilance and strive for autonomy, trust and personal and professional growth. Our stack is in Ruby, Java/JRuby, and Javascript. We welcome any language background and get deep into Elasticsearch. What You Will Bring: Previous experience building software systems which interlink with various API sources through OAuth or similar. Experience building an SDK, \u201capp ecosystem\u201d or similar would be helpful. Excellent practical judgement. You know how to prioritize, when to collaborate and ask for help, and when to be independent. Measured and articulate written and spoken communication skills. You work well with others and can craft concise and expressive thoughts into correspondence: issues, investigations, documentation and onboarding material. An interest in learning new tools, languages, workflows and philosophies that can help you grow. You can function well in an environment that drives towards change. This role has tremendous opportunity for growth! If this sounds interesting, we would love to hear from you! Please include whatever info you believe is relevant: resume, GitHub profile, code samples, blog posts and writing samples, links to personal projects, etc. Additional Information \u2013 We Take Care of Our People As a distributed company, diversity drives our identity.
