All applicants are welcome. Â  Â  Â  Salary Range: The salary range for the role of Communications Director is $100K \u2013 $130K for candidates based in SF, NYC or DC.Â  The salary range will be adjusted based on cost of living data for folks who live in less expensive regions.Â  Here\u2019s why: we feel strongly that progressive organizations should optimize for a consistent standard of living for all employees. Â  Â  Â  About VoteAmerica VoteAmerica is a nonpartisan nonprofit that works to ensure that democracy still exists in the United States in 2021. We focus on increasing voter turnout by identifying and clearing roadblocks to voter participation. Given decades of active voter suppression, a global pandemic, hostile foreign interference, hostile domestic interference, the partisan hijacking of the DOJ, record-high joblessness, civil unrest, and about a dozen other things, we have our work cut out for us. Fortunately, we\u2019re not fucking around over here. We\u2019re a new org staffed by long-time politicos and voter turnout experts, and we\u2019re looking for other folks who aren\u2019t fucking around to join us.

Community Communications: Develop missives to partners, allies, and practitioners that increase awareness of our capabilities and drive adoption of our tools and platform. Executive Visibility: Everything from the main stage at major thought leadership events to of-the-moment op-eds (both through owned and earned outlets).

You\u2019ll grab relevant news stories, inject it with VoteAmerica messaging, and release it to generate tons of media coverage and engagement that expand the VoteAmerica mission. Long-form Academic: Working with a specialist writer and collaborator(s), you will prepare VoteAmerica program, strategy, and research for publication in peer-reviewed journals and academic outlets.
