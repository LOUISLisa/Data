If you are able to bring clarity to complexity and lightness to heavy problems, you could be a great fit for our team. Last year, we took the stage at TED and shared our audacious goal of eliminating child sexual abuse material from the internet. A key aspect of our work is keeping abreast of the new ways technology is used to sexually exploit and abuse children and building the right technology in response to combat this, as well as building technology to optimize the broader ecosystem combating online child sexual abuse.

You will collaborate closely with Engineering and Product to identify insights and models most valuable to research and implement. You will be responsible for acquiring data, crafting and performing analytical experiments in a disciplined manner, evaluating and iterating on results, and discussing results with your team. When you and the team conclude that the performance of your solution meets expectations, you will partner with members of the Engineering team to deploy your work into a production environment. What You\u2019ll Do: Research and develop statistical modeling for data analysis. Collaborate with team members to drive understanding of product needs and devise possible solutions. Discuss results and ideas with key partners, which will include child victim identification specialists, relevant law enforcement, and technology companies.
