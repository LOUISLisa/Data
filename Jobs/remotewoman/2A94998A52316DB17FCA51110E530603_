Experience in the following areas Web Developer: You probably have a broad software development background (we use Python, JavaScript, Clojure, Go, Haskell, Rust, and more!) but you\u2019re skilled in at least one web ecosystem. Site-Reliability Engineering: We are an operations team. We solve problems with code, but fundamentally we keep things working. You may have worked as an SRE. Service-Oriented: Multiple years of hands-on experience administering Linux, preferably with distributed systems with some scale. You\u2019ve probably helped run a SaaS platform. Infrastructure-as-code: You may have experience automating production Linux systems collaboratively, deriving configuration through version control, and are proficient in some of Docker, Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt, Habitat, Dhall, Terraform, Packer, your own shell scripts. Maybe you\u2019ve thrown half of that away and use Kubernetes. We do that too. What you will bring along Rails experience, or at least a strong desire to work in Rails, required. You have a strong desire to automate and monitor. You have a desire to build reusable software components. You\u2019ve likely created an open source library for your favorite language, or at least made a meaningful contribution to one. You enjoy a versioned workflow, representing your work in git, motivated by a GitHub workflow through issues and pull requests. You have a healthy knowledge of Linux (have compiled your own kernel at some point, know how to trace syscalls, understand TCP, care about the difference between sysvinit/runit/systemd, etc.) You don\u2019t have to know everything, but be motivated to solve problems like these. You love open source development, and have committed to some project somewhere (doesn\u2019t have to be ours), whether mailing lists, patches, documentation, etc. You enjoy working with a distributed company and the active, asynchronous communication it requires.
