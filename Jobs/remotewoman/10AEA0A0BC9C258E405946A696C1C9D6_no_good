From finding documents to monitoring infrastructure to hunting for threats, Elastic makes data usable in real time and at scale. Thousands of organizations worldwide, including Barclays, Cisco, eBay, Fairfax, ING, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, The Mayo Clinic, NASA, The New York Times, Wikipedia, and Verizon, use Elastic to power mission-critical systems. Founded in 2012, Elastic is a distributed company with Elasticians around the globe. Learn more at elastic.co Engineering a distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a challenge. It requires software development skills and the ability to think like a user. We care deeply about giving you ownership of what you\u2019re working on. Our company believes we achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers. At Elastic, we feel that you should be empowered to comment on anything, regardless of your role within the company. Our team builds Elasticsearch, the heart of the Elastic Stack. We are looking for an engineer to join the Elasticsearch Engineering Performance team to focus on helping us understand how Elasticsearch performs and scales under workloads representative of our three main solutions: search, observe, protect. This person will provide clarification around sizing and performance guidance that our field organization and our users will leverage to design deployments across a variety of use cases. Our users range from small startups who want to add a search bar to their website to large corporations deploying our full suite of observability products across their entire infrastructure. Our mission is to enable each of them to deploy our software in a way that will set them up for success and grow with them. Here are the kinds of questions this person will create guidance for: If a user needs to index 200 gigabytes of Apache logs per day and has a 10-day retention policy, what should that Elasticsearch cluster look like? What if retention is two years? For a user of Elastic\u2019s Security solution with 10,000 endpoints deployed, how large will their cluster need to be in order to perform an investigation spanning the previous five years of activity in their organization? How does query performance change as data ages from a hot tier with fast SSDs to a cold tier with slow spinning disks? Answering these questions would need you to craft, execute, and interpret realistic benchmarks based on actual usage of our products. To get there, you will partner with other engineering teams to understand how our various products and solutions exercise Elasticsearch, as well as with our field organization and product management teams to turn benchmark results into meaningful and actionable guidance. What you bring along: An understanding of benchmarking methodology. Can you explain what makes a benchmark useful? Can you describe some common pitfalls that people encounter when they try to benchmark a system? A background in a technical customer-facing role. Maybe you\u2019ve been a sales engineer, or a consultant, or a support engineer. Python experience. You will be contributing to our benchmarking infrastructure and tooling (such as Rally) which is written in Python. Strong Linux skills. You should be comfortable on the command line, have experience with observability tools such as iostat, nstat, vmstat, and know your way around procfs, etc. Knowledge of Java and the JVM, or a strong desire to learn. While you will not be writing Java day-to-day, Elasticsearch is a Java application. #Additional Information \u2013 We Take Care of Our People As a distributed company, diversity drives our identity.
