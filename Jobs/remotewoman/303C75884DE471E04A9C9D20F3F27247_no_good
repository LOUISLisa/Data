This includes the security of sourcegraph.com as well as making it easy for our customers to secure their own private Sourcegraph instances that they deploy on-premise. You will be responsible for proactively understanding, documenting, and improving the security of our product, as well as promptly responding to and addressing security issues reported to us by third parties. As our security needs grow over time, there is a potential for you to grow into a security team leadership role. Qualifications We are looking for candidates with the following skills, and we will test for these things in our interview process: Broad knowledge of possible attack vectors for applications like Sourcegraph and an understanding of how to eliminate and/or mitigate those security risks. This knowledge generally comes from having multiple years of software development experience in the security domain. Skilled at understanding, debugging, and writing code (ideally Go and TypeScript) to identify and fix security issues. Demonstrated ability to own large ambiguous problems while making continuous progress. Ability to communicate clearly and empathetically, especially in writing and documentation. Nice-to-haves Experience leading a team. Published blog posts and/or tech talks about your work. Experience working on high-performing teams, preferably tech startups.

To create a product that serves the needs of all developers, we are building a diverse all-remote team that is distributed across the world. We provide competitive compensation and practical benefits to keep you happy, healthy, and productive. Learn more about what it is like to work at Sourcegraph by reading our handbook. Interview process You apply here. We set up a 30-minute call to learn more about what you are looking for, tell you about Sourcegraph, and answer any questions that you have. We evaluate relevant technical skills that you have via an asynchronous coding exercise. We will give you an overview of the exercise in advance. We will send you the details at a time of your choosing and you will have up to 2 hours to work on the exercise. You will be able to use your own development environment and lookup documentation on the internet. We schedule 4 hours of remote interviews over video chat across multiple days. Architecture: We give you an open problem statement and you walk us through how you would solve the problem. Technical experience: We ask you about your past work and accomplishments. Team collaboration: We ask you about how you work and communicate in a team setting, and how you handle tricky situations. CEO/CTO: We ask you about what motivates you to do your best work, and we tell you more about the vision for the company. We check your references. We make you a job offer. We want to ensure Sourcegraph is an environment that suits your working style and empowers you to do your best work, so we are eager to answer any questions that you have about us at any point in the interview process.
