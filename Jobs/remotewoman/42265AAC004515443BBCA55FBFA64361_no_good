The first project for the person in this new role will be assigned to is based in Chiswick, London. There is an expectation that this PM will be on-site with the client for the majority of their working time, but remote work will be possible for an agreed upon portion. After this project completes, it is likely that the majority of future work will be primarily remote besides the occasional on-site visit.

Our customers, F1000\u2019s and startups alike, come to us because they need to change how something is done in order to succeed and they\u2019re looking for a solution that isn\u2019t just about technology \u2014 but also people, process and leadership. We consult, form a diverse team of experts, and deliver strategy and execution all under one roof. Our services range from new product development, pure R&D, legacy modernization, pricing strategy development, revenue generation, process optimization, to organizational transformation and cultural design.

Our focus on culture is supported by our shared vision to build a company where we want to work for the long-term. We avoid egos and embrace distributed leadership. We grow from constantly being challenged and seek to understand when presented with ideas we don\u2019t understand.
