Your creative work and approach must be rooted in anti-racist practices, and your experience, either lived or professional or both, should show a strong commitment to justice of all kinds. If you\u2019re as curious about how we can develop better design systems as you are about how the folks on your team will thrive and grow; if you can differentiate design trends from design shifts while making strategic recommendations to clients; if you can lead a team to foster the most creative ideas while also offering hands on practical advice for how to solve problems; if you have a strong vision for how a creative team best functions in order to serve some of the largest and most progressive nonprofits in the world, this might be the position for you. ThinkShout can offer you a community of welcoming and kind designers, strategists, developers, project managers, account managers, and executives who are committed to putting people and the planet first. We believe that your leadership on the director team and across the company will be crucial to our continued transformation. Requirements What We\u2019re Looking For An experienced creative director who is as excited about inspiring clients and community partners as they are managing the day to day needs of ThinkShout\u2019s creative team. A track record of mentoring and cultivating creative professionals\u2019 skills and careers who are working across many digital projects at a time. Experience leading and executing creative deliverables, including the desire and ability to create complex UX/UI design work for multi-platform digital engagements with complex, sophisticated clients. This role also includes frequent client presentations and ongoing workshop facilitation (both in-person and digital) at critical moments of project lifecycles, as well as some production work. An instinct for innovation towards ThinkShout\u2019s creative offerings, especially with respect to how our clients maintain complex design systems, meet developing accessibility requirements, and build on existing visual brand elements. A track record of building strong account relationships with key client creative partners alongside Account Managers and Project Managers. Comfort with ambiguity in the face of tight timelines and competing priorities and an ability to support your team in constantly prioritizing their own schedules and projects. Ease in establishing project partnerships with strategists and developers to bring the strategic vision to life and to apply designs before and during implementation. Deep knowledge with design programs including Sketch and Adobe Creative Suite, and a general knowledge of WordPress and/or Drupal as well as how designs are applied in HTML and CSS How You\u2019ll Spend Your Time Leadership: You\u2019ll set the vision, direction, and cadence for our creative team\u2019s day to day work and longterm goals. You\u2019ll oversee creative quality for the company, represent our team during high-stakes sales pitches, and partner with our director team to consistently move ThinkShout forward in our mission of building a curious, transparent, inclusive, optimistic, and compassionate company. Full Service Offerings: You\u2019ll define, build, and maintain creative service offerings for ThinkShout\u2019s client work which could include any design deliverable within a client\u2019s ecosystem,Â eg, expand an existing brand, create wireframes, develop creative direction, expand social assets, and even ranging into print. Innovation: You\u2019ll identify areas of growth for our team that best serve our clients and agency goals and ensure that we are skilled and staffed to fulfil those needs. Client Design Work: This role will mostly focus on team, company, and community leadership, but you\u2019ll also execute design for select clients and support our team on production work when necessary. Community Engagement: You\u2019ll build ThinkShout\u2019s creative voice beyond the boundaries of our company, presenting at conferences, engaging in community events, and developing relationships with other creative leaders who are working to put people and the planet first. Management & Cultivation: You\u2019ll pay close attention to what creative team members need to be successful and provide crucial mentorship and guidance. You\u2019ll celebrate growth and offer constructive feedback that is foundational to a trusting, transparent, and caring team. Benefits Our home office is in Portland, OR.
