You will design and implement ways to extract semantic information from code so that we can support fast precise code intelligence (e.g., go to definition, find references) for every language in a way that scales to the largest codebases in the world. Read our project roadmap to see the challenges that we are working on today and in the near future. Qualifications Comfortable developing, testing, and debugging backend services in TypeScript or Go. Experience with multiple programming languages, dependency management systems, and build systems coupled with a strong desire to learn new ones. Ability to communicate clearly and empathetically, especially in writing and documentation. Practiced at creating high quality software balanced with a pragmatic understanding of how to make appropriate tradeoffs (e.g., cut scope) to ship quickly and iterate when necessary. Nice-to-haves Experience making distributed systems observable (e.g., logging, Prometheus metrics, request tracing). Experience using Postgres and Redis. Experience load testing distributed systems. Experience writing high performance code and benchmarks. Large and/or numerous contributions to open source projects. Published blog posts and/or tech talks about your work. Experience working on small high-performing teams, preferably tech startups. Learn more about us To create a product that serves the needs of all developers, we are building a diverse all-remote team that is distributed across the world. Sourcegraph is an equal opportunity workplace; we welcome people from all backgrounds and communities. We provide competitive compensation and practical benefits to keep you happy and healthy so that you can do your best work. Learn more about what it is like to work at Sourcegraph by reading our handbook. Interview process You apply here. We set up a 30-minute call to learn more about what you are looking for, tell you about Sourcegraph, and answer any questions that you have. You complete a 2-hour coding exercise in TypeScript, or Go. Click those links to learn more about the exercises. If you are not comfortable with either of these languages, we will figure something out. We schedule 4 hours of remote interviews over video chat across multiple days. Architecture: We give you an open problem statement and you walk us through how you would solve the problem. Technical experience: We ask you about your past work and accomplishments. Team collaboration: We ask you about how you work and communicate in a team setting, and how you handle tricky situations. CEO/CTO: We ask you about what motivates you to do your best work, and we tell you more about the vision for the company. We check your references. We make you a job offer. We want to ensure Sourcegraph is an environment that suits your working style and empowers you to do your best work, so we are eager to answer any questions that you have about us at any point in the interview process.
