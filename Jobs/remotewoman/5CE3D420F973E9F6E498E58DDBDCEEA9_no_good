The Resilience Engineering team\u2019s goal is to make this complex system as well understood as possible to reduce the risk of making changes in our production environment. The Resilience Engineering team finds vulnerabilities, risks, and limits in our system before they lead to large scale issues. To do this, we build an Infrastructure Experimentation platform for Netflix Engineers to safely experiment with their services in production as well as tools that provide operational insights. Our platform uses a Canary strategy to run chaos, load, and software change experiments in production so that engineers can better understand the limits of their application and the Netflix ecosystem. Our production environment is complex. We are looking for someone to join our team that is comfortable with ambiguity, but also great at driving ambiguity down. Our perfect candidate must have a great desire to help engineers around them succeed, be comfortable consulting with engineers that are implementing our tools when needed, and realize that building strong relationships with partner teams will allow their own team to succeed faster than if we work alone. Who you are You are extremely comfortable with complex distributed systems You can work independently but enjoy working on a team and building strong relationships You care about what makes a team great and do your part to make that a reality You write testable, clear, and re-usable code You are humble and eager to learn from mistakes and you socialize the lessons learned You can argue both sides of most disagreements You collaborate well with your team and partner teams You reflect and seek feedback on your code, design choices, and the project trade-offs you make What you\u2019ll do Study the problems in the software resilience, operational, and delivery spaces Work with Service-owning teams to help them experiment with their applications in production using our tools and platforms Create new solutions and see them through, from conception to production Write code to support our existing solutions Build platforms that give Netflix Engineers confidence in the operations of their application Work with partner teams to create a cohesive experience for service owning engineers Requirements You have built or contributed to a variety of systems, ideally in different technologies You are an expert in a modern programming language and very comfortable writing in Java You are at the point in your career where learning new technology and getting up to speed on new codebases has become routine and your growth areas are more focused on how humans work well together Nice to have Experience creating products for engineers Experience developing telemetry tools Experience building data-driven apps Experience with real-time or near real-time data Experience with experimentation Apply for job Apply for job If this job interests you but you aren\u2019t certain if you meet all of theÂ requirements, apply anyway!
