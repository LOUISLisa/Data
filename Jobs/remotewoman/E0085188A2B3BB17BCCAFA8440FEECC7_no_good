You should be super organized, self-motivated, and have a knack for solving problems before they come up. Krit is a growing digital agency that partners with early-stage startups to design and build innovative new products. We work with 8-10 clients at any time on projects like: Designing a web app to visualize the background noise of the internet and uncover the next wave of cyberattacks. Creating software to help some of the world\u2019s largest, most-respected universities make better financial decisions. Building a mobile app that makes communicating with clients during stressful times simple and effective for lawyers. Our clients\u2019 products have been used by brands like Dropbox, Lyft, Microsoft, Nike, Yale University, and more. Last year, we made $700,000 in revenue as a company and are on track to increase that this year. We\u2019re a bootstrapped, transparent company and share our profits with our team. We also try not to take ourselves too seriously. ð What we\u2019re looking for Patient and kind You will be working closely with clients and our team at Krit.

Comfortable balancing schedules and priorities When working with multiple clients, you have to be able to balance competing schedules and priorities. This means making judgment calls, as well as keeping track of lots of information in parallel.
