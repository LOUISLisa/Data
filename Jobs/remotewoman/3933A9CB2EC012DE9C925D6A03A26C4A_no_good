We build tools to ease these decisions by presenting solutions that span the gaps. Our tools manage both physical machines and virtual machines, Windows, and Linux, SaaS and IaaS, etc. At HashiCorp, we value top-notch collaboration and communication skills, both among internal teams and in how we interact with our users. We take care to balance and be responsive to the needs of our open source community as well as our enterprise level customers. Engineering at HashiCorp is largely a remote team. While prior experience working remotely isn\u2019t required, we are looking for team members who perform well given a high level of independence and autonomy. About the role: The Cloud Services team is a newly created organization working towards delivering our software as a Cloud service. This effort will enable a distribution model wherein customers can use a fully managed service with an API contract. In this role, you can expect to: Build a billing service primarily in Golang. Contribute to the design and implementation of extremely large-scale systems. Interface directly with internal teams, users, and HashiCorp customers. Work with multiple cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, and Azure. Work with HashiCorp products such as Terraform, Consul, Vault, and Nomad. You may be a good fit for our team if: You have 5+ years of software development experience in a fast paced environment operating large-scale systems. Have built or maintained a billing or metering system for an Enterprise service. Understand how cloud providers measure customer resource usage. Have a strong understanding of financial security and compliance. Are familiar with microservice architectures, and ideally, have seen them in operation on a global scale. Are able to knowledgeably discuss design and performance tradeoffs in complex systems. Have prior experience working in high performance or distributed systems; while we strive to hire at a variety of experience levels, this particular opening is not well-suited for recent graduates. In your cover letter, please describe why you\u2019re interested in working at HashiCorp, and on the Cloud Services, Billing and Metering team in particular. Specifics of your past experience that are relevant to this role are great to include too. HashiCorp embraces diversity and equal opportunity. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe the more inclusive we are, the better our company will be. #LI \u2013 AZ1 Apply for job Apply for job If this job interests you but you aren\u2019t certain if you meet all of theÂ requirements, apply anyway!
