About VoteAmerica VoteAmerica is a nonpartisan nonprofit that works to ensure that democracy still exists in the United States in 2021. We focus on increasing voter turnout by identifying and clearing roadblocks to voter participation. Given decades of active voter suppression, a global pandemic, hostile foreign interference, hostile domestic interference, the partisan hijacking of the DOJ, record-high joblessness, civil unrest, and about a dozen other things, we have our work cut out for us. Fortunately, we\u2019re not fucking around over here. We\u2019re a new org staffed by long-time politicos and voter turnout experts, and we\u2019re looking for other folks who aren\u2019t fucking around to join us.
