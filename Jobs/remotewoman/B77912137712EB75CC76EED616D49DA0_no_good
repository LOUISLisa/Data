We\u2019re a multidisciplinary, fully remote team that\u2019s passionate about creating products, likeÂ TodoistÂ andÂ Twist, that improve people\u2019s lives. We thrive on innovating new solutions to old productivity challenges and we seek to rethink how productivity tools are made. When you become a Doister, you\u2019re not only joining a global, remote-first company, but a team of 70+ people who value: Independence.Â Others can trust that you\u2019ll deliver on time and your teammates don\u2019t need to worry about you keeping your word. Mastery.Â You love what you do and care deeply about the quality of your work, down to the smallest details. You\u2019re continuously learning and pushing yourself to the limits of your ability. You\u2019re never satisfied with the status-quo. Communication.Â Your communication is clear, concise, and engaging whether you\u2019re explaining a complex idea or providing feedback to a teammate. Balance.Â You\u2019re mindful about cultivating a healthy work-life balance. You care about the well-being of yourself, your team and the people around you. Impact.Â You\u2019re able to take a bird\u2019s eye view to pinpoint and then solve issues that have a high impact on our customers, our team, and our company. You\u2019re committed to the health and success of both your teammates and Doist as a company. We invite you toÂ visit our blogÂ to learn more about us, our values, and how we work. The Frontend team at Doist is looking for a new developer to join their ranks to build the best possible user experience for millions of user across multiple products. How we work The Frontend team is responsible for all code that runs in a browser. Be it the web apps of Twist and Todoist, browser extensions, electron apps or our landing pages. Our main product work happens inside cross-disciplinary teams, that we call squads. You can read more about this in ourÂ blog. We have a rotating Hero role whose main responsibility is to tackle support issues, fix bugs and work on smaller improvements. On top of that everybody on the team gets a day per week to spend on Housekeeping; during this time we pay back technical debt, fix bugs and in general improve the health of our code base. We believe in picking the most effective tools to do our best work. At the moment this means most of our communication happens asynchronously in Twist. Code and bugs are managed and reviewed in GitHub. Team meetings are done in Zoom. We don\u2019t have a lot of scheduled meetings. Once a week the team meets to discuss the previous week and plan the next one. Once a month the whole team comes together for a retrospective to share candid feedback and take a look at the coming month. Day-to-day work What your work will look like on a day-to-day basis: Implement features.Â From proposal, through specification and implementation, to maintenance. You\u2019re encouraged and expected to propose things that you think can be a good addition to the product. Provide feedback.Â When planning a feature you\u2019re expected to provide feedback on expected challenges and unknowns as early as possible. Improve the code quality.Â With time, our code accumulated some technical debt, which we pay off. Often we do it while we make features, but we also dedicate time to housekeeping each week. Be a responsible & exemplary team member.Â We do code reviews, refactor code, learn new things and share our knowledge. You might also be appointed mentor of a new comer Lead a squad.Â From time to time you might be a squad leader which bears the responsibility for the success of the project. In practical terms, you plan the squad work and orchestrate its execution. You balance this activity with hands-on work within the same squad. Be a Hero.Â During this time you\u2019ll be working closely with the support team to triage and fix bugs from users. Also, you help speed up code reviews and support other teams in their projects.
