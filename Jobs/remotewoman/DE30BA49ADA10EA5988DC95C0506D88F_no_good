We\u2019re a multidisciplinary, fully remote team that\u2019s passionate about creating products, like Todoist and Twist, that improve people\u2019s lives. We thrive on innovating new solutions to old productivity challenges and we seek to rethink how productivity tools are made. When you become a Doister, you\u2019re not only joining a global, remote-first company, but a team of 70+ people who value: Independence. Others can trust that you\u2019ll deliver on time and your teammates don\u2019t need to worry about you keeping your word. Mastery. You love what you do and care deeply about the quality of your work, down to the smallest details. You\u2019re continuously learning and pushing yourself to the limits of your ability. You\u2019re never satisfied with the status-quo. Communication. Your communication is clear, concise, and engaging whether you\u2019re explaining a complex idea or providing feedback to a teammate. Ambition & Balance. You aspire to put a dent in the universe. To do this, you set high standards for yourself and those around you. The time you spend on work isn\u2019t measured by quantity, but by quality. Impact. You\u2019re able to take a bird\u2019s eye view to pinpoint and then solve issues that have a high impact on our customers, our team, and our company. You\u2019re committed to the health and success of both your teammates and Doist as a company. We invite you to visit our blog to learn more about us, our values, and how we work. How we work The Frontend team is responsible for all code that runs in a browser. Be it the web apps of Twist and Todoist, browser extensions, electron apps or our landing pages. Our main product work happens inside cross-disciplinary teams, that we call squads. You can read more about this in our blog. We have a rotating Hero role whose main responsibility is to tackle support issues, fix bugs and work on smaller improvements. On top of that everybody on the team gets a day per week to spend on Housekeeping; during this time we pay back technical debt, fix bugs and in general improve the health of our code base. We believe in picking the most effective tools to do our best work. At the moment this means most of our communication happens asynchronously in Twist. Code and bugs are managed and reviewed in GitHub. Team meetings are done in Zoom. Day-to-day work What does your work look like on a day-to-day basis: Implement features: From proposal, through specification and implementation, to maintenance. You\u2019re encouraged and expected to propose things that you think can be a good addition to the product. Provide feedback: When planning a feature you\u2019re expected to provide feedback on expected challenges and unknowns as early as possible. Improve the code quality: With time, our code accumulated some technical debt, which we pay off. Often we do it while we make features, but we also dedicate time to housekeeping each week. Be a responsible & exemplary team member: We do code reviews, refactor code, learn new things and share our knowledge. You might also be appointed mentor of a new comer Lead a squad: From time to time you might be a squad leader which bears the responsibility for the success of the project. In practical terms, you plan the squad work and orchestrate its execution. You balance this activity with hands-on work within the same squad. Be a Hero: During this time you\u2019ll be working closely with support to triage and fix bugs from users. Also, you help speed up code reviews and support other teams in their projects. Indicators that this could be a good role for you: You feel that our values resonate with yours, and you see how they can act as guidance for your day-to-day work. You have 5+ years of frontend development experience. You have experience in building complex interactive web applications. You have solid knowledge of modern JavaScript and React (Bonus: Redux) You have experience in writing automated unit, integration or end-to-end tests. You have experience in measuring, analyzing and fixing performance problems. You\u2019re able to use and customize tools (e.g. webpack) to streamline our development and build processes.
