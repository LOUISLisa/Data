We pride ourselves on the best in class customer happiness, providing the highest possible quality products that are affordable for the majority and assembly that isn\u2019t dreadful. As a people-first company, we understood from day oneÂ the importance ofÂ being fully distributed. WeÂ encourage everyoneÂ to work in a whichever manner that helpsÂ themÂ performÂ theirÂ best. ABOUT THE ROLE: You\u2019ll be responsible for overseeing and managing all aspects of transportation, warehousing, and order fulfillment for Nathan James. You\u2019ll help the operations team by managing relationships with all logistics 3rdÂ parties, assisting with high level planning, continual improvement implementation, and creative cost reduction ideation/execution. As the driver of the Logistics Division, you will also have ample opportunity to carve out your own passion projects related to operational improvements and cost reductions. A deep understanding of operations management, particularly focused on inbound and outbound modeling, is a pre-requisite for succeeding in this role.Â  Managing both an internal team and external partners also requires being able to provide support from multiple perspectives regarding any aspect related to operational processes.Â  Since this division and these processes are susceptible to continual change, the ideal candidate has the unique ability to quickly learn and teach these procedures. During training, you\u2019ll be expected to be proactive in your process and learn quickly.

We\u2019re ready for the ongoing work that goes into building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best work of your career. Our values, workplace and our benefits are designed to support a sustainable, healthy relationship with your work.

This is a remote role, since we are a remote/fully distributed company! You\u2019re free to work where you work best, anywhere in the world: home office, coworking space, or coffee shops. You should be comfortable working remotely, that hinges on effective writing, self-discipline, and comfort with open communication. BENEFITS & PERKS: Our benefits are all aimed at supporting a life well lived, both at work and away from work.

We\u2019re accepting applications until 05/12/2020 00:00:00 UTC. Next: We expect to take a few daysÂ to review all applications. You\u2019ll hear from us by 5/21/2020 about advancement to an introductory call. If we both find the fit to right, then we would proceed to a work sample, then on to a interview.

We aim to make an offer by 7/3/2020 at the latestÂ with a start date inÂ midÂ July. We appreciate your consideration in having Nathan James be part of your career.
