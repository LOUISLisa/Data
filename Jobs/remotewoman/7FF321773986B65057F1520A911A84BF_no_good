You will be touching some of the most cutting edge network and optical equipment on the market, so you must come armed with well developed problem solving skills. You should be willing to take risks and learn new technologies as soon as (or before) they come to market. A typical day in the life of a PacketFabric Network Architect might include these types of activities: Perform ad-hoc network-level testing of PacketFabric services, as well as any existing or new network functionality.

Support Software Engineers by providing network lab resources for use by QA Engineers to test enhancements to the PacketFabric portal, and other software systems. Deliver high quality documentation on all projects, to be used by Network Engineering and other teams within the company. Automate anything and everything that can be automated! Enhance automated system tools that support the network. Assist the Production Network Engineering team in day to day activities, including, but not limited to, troubleshooting network issues, upgrading/replacing network hardware, and monitoring the overall health of the network. Respond to and work to resolve customer issues via phone, chat, or support tickets, during work hours or during rotating on-call schedule. And of course, since this is a start-up, we arenÃ¢\u20acâ¢t just asking you to wear one hat. When you get a break, you can assist any of our other teams!
