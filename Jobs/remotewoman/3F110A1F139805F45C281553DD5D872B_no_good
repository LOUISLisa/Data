We have a variety of well-established government contracts that we expect to continue over the next few years. Also, we\u2019re winning new work, and we have a robust rainy day fund. Second, during video interviews, you\u2019ll likely see more of our human side. Family members, partners, kids and pets are home with some of us! We promise to be present and engaged, but we may be a little\u2026harried. It\u2019s OK if you are, too \u2013 we understand that everyone is experiencing extra stress right now. If you have any questions along the way, please let us know, and stay healthy and safe. ** * This position will be open to applications until 9am Pacific, Monday 6/22/2020 Truss is tackling tough technical problems for the private sector and government.
