Our staff solves dynamic, quickly evolving problems with our network of partners from tech companies, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies. If you are able to bring clarity to complexity and lightness to heavy problems, you could be a great fit for our team. Last year, we took the stage at TED and shared our audacious goal of eliminating child sexual abuse material from the internet. About The Role A key aspect of our work is partnering with the tech industry. Our latest product, Safer, is designed to proactively identify, remove, and report child sexual abuse material from our partners\u2019 platforms. As you join our small but mighty team at an early stage of this product, you will work together with our team to implement and ship a world-class product. What You\u2019ll Do Collaborate with other engineers on your team to build backend systems & client applications from end-to-end. Work closely with the product manager and engineers to define product requirements, and collaborate to devise optimal engineering solutions. Present possible technical solutions to various stakeholders, clearly explaining your decisions and how they address real user needs, incorporating feedback in subsequent iterations. Play a critical role in day-to-day coding, code reviews, and troubleshooting production issues. Drive technical innovation by researching and incorporating new technologies and tools into our core system. Skills We\u2019re Seeking You have a commitment to putting the children we serve at the center of everything you do.

You communicate clearly, efficiently, and thoughtfully. We\u2019re a highly-distributed team, so written communication is crucial, from Slack to pull requests to code reviews Technologies We Use You should have non-trivial experience with a couple of these, but we\u2019re excited about teaching folks that have the desire and ability to learn the rest.
