We\u2019re a multidisciplinary, fully remote team that\u2019s passionate about creating products, likeÂ TodoistÂ andÂ Twist, that improve people\u2019s lives. We thrive on innovating new solutions to old productivity challenges and we seek to rethink how productivity tools are made. When you become a Doister, you\u2019re not only joining a global, remote-first company, but a team of 70+ people who value: Independence.Â Others can trust that you\u2019ll deliver on time and your teammates don\u2019t need to worry about you keeping your word. Mastery.Â You love what you do and care deeply about the quality of your work, down to the smallest details. You\u2019re continuously learning and pushing yourself to the limits of your ability. You\u2019re never satisfied with the status-quo. Communication.Â Your communication is clear, concise, and engaging whether you\u2019re explaining a complex idea or providing feedback to a teammate. Ambition & Balance.Â You aspire to put a dent in the universe. To do this, you set high standards for yourself and those around you. The time you spend on work isn\u2019t measured by quantity, but by quality. Impact.Â You\u2019re able to take a bird\u2019s eye view to pinpoint and then solve issues that have a high impact on our customers, our team, and our company. You\u2019re committed to the health and success of both your teammates and Doist as a company. We invite you toÂ visit our blogÂ to learn more about us, our values, and how we work. How we work On the Backend team, we take care of all server-side code, infrastructure, and API. The main product work happens inside cross-disciplinary teams that we call squads. You can read more aboutÂ how we manage projectsÂ on our blog. Also, we have a rotating role of so-called Hero, whose main responsibility is to triage support issues and fix the most pressing ones. Finally, we dedicate time to housekeeping and learning. We use Twist to keep ourselves on the same page. We use GitHub pull requests to review each other\u2019s work. Once a week, we have a video chat to discuss the challenges of the past week and plan our work. Day-to-day work What you can expect to do on a regular basis: Create features.Â From the proposal, through specification and implementation, to maintenance. Often these features are implemented as documented API endpoints. You\u2019re encouraged and expected to propose things that you think can be helpful for the product. Provide feedback.Â When planning a feature, it\u2019s the job of senior developers of each team to provide feedback on expected challenges and unknowns as early as possible. Improve the code.Â With time, our code and data structures accumulated some technical debt, which we pay off. Often we do it while we make features, but we also dedicate time to housekeeping. Be a responsible team member.Â We do code reviews, refactor code, learn new things and share our knowledge. Occasionally you will be appointed as the mentor of newcomers. Occasionally be a Squad Leader.Â Squad leaders bear the ultimate responsibility for the success of their projects. In practical terms, they plan the squad work and orchestrate its execution until the end of the cycle. They balance this activity with hands-on work within the same squad. Occasionally be a Hero.Â A hero is a developer whose main priority is working closely with support at triaging and fixing bug reports. Also, they help speed up reviewing processes and support other teams in their projects.
