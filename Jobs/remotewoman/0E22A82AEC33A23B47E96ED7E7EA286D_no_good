You\u2019ll be working directly with the CEO and a tight-knit product team to build a coherent and beautiful design language that will form the basis for the Graphy brand for years to come. \u2013 **Constant stream of new challenges.** The pace at which Graphy is growing brings new technical and business challenges each day. There\u2019s a very large and exciting opportunity ahead for us which requires us all to wear multiple hats, and keeps every day exciting. ## We are Graphy **We\u2019re on a mission to reimagine how teams work with data.** Graphy is the all-in-one data collaboration platform where teams create beautiful and interactive dashboards, loaded with data from apps teams already use and love. We are built with remote-first processes and have an office in London, UK. Backed by top tier VCs and Angel investors, we have an ambitious roadmap and are growing our team. ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c7667f37-e763-468f-9314-889dbac06109/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c7667f37-e763-468f-9314-889dbac06109/Untitled.png) ## The opportunity London / Remote (GMT to GMT+2) At Graphy, design matters deeply to us. We believe that data has gotten a bad rap. Highly technical, overly complicated tools have made working with data onerous, tedious, and difficult. Our goal is to make working with data light, joyful, and collaborative. And we know it\u2019s going to take a lot of very good design to get there. That\u2019s where you come in: As the first full-time product designer at Graphy you\u2019ll have the opportunity to help us build the next generation data platform from the ground up. You\u2019ll also be instrumental in shaping our design culture, systems, and team. ## What you\u2019ll do \u200d \u2013 Partner closely with Product and Customer Success to do in-depth qualitative and quantitative user research to deeply understand the problem space. \u2013 Work through design problems from start to finish. Once you have a deep understanding of the problem space you\u2019ll clearly articulate why these problems matters to our customers and what we plan to do to solve them. \u2013 This includes experimenting with various solutions, creating flows, prototypes, and high-fidelity visual mockups and prototypes for new products and features. \u2013 Partner closely with Product to build our product roadmap. \u2013 You\u2019ll also own our nascent design system: \u2013 This includes researching best practices and taking inspiration from others. \u2013 Work directly with the CEO to help create a beautiful, unique, and coherent design language and style for Graphy. \u2013 Design and collaborate with engineers to implement new React UI components and improve existing ones. ### What we look for \u2013 Great taste and ability to translate that taste into beautiful UI & visual design of modern products, balancing a maniacal focus on details with a pragmatic focus on the business goals. \u2013 An ability to distill complex and often ambiguous problems into effective solutions that carefully navigate the right tradeoffs. \u2013 Strong communication skills. \u2013 Enthusiasm for scaling Graphy\u2019s team. \u2013 Familiarity with tools such as Figma / Sketch / Framer / Invision. \u2013 Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. \u2013 Basic understanding of front-end JavaScript; you won\u2019t be expected to code, but an understanding of the constraints is key. \u2013 To be in a timezone between GMT and GMT+2. It\u2019s a plus if you have some experience with: \u2013 Building React-based components. \u2013 Designing animations & transitions. \u2013 Building for accessibility. \u2013 Rendering React components to Figma / Sketch / Framer. ## Benefits **Competitive salary & equity package** \u200d **Remote-first processes** (or an office if you\u2019re in London) **Personal growth fund and a bi-weekly afternoon dedicated to learning** ï¸ **Retreats every 6 months in some cool place in Europe** **New equipment to build your own workspace** (fully specced MacBook Pro or equivalent, monitors, software etc.) **Team activities** (virtual lunches, livestream yoga, etc) **Kindle + ebooks** **Flexible working** ## Our tech stack We don\u2019t expect you to be experienced with these, but in case you\u2019re interested: ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/80de261e-f457-4444-ae2c-3aaf54d07838/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/80de261e-f457-4444-ae2c-3aaf54d07838/Untitled.png) View full list: [**https://stackshare.io/graphy/graphy**](https://stackshare.io/graphy/graphy) \u2014 Now we would love to hear from you.
