We\u2019re building the definitive platform for startups \u2014 where they raise money through AngelList Venture, build teams through AngelList Talent, and launch their products through Product Hunt. The venture team is fundamentally altering how startups raise money by replacing early-stage venture capital with modern technology. We\u2019ve delivered over $1B to more than 3,000 startups over the past few years. Our infrastructure allows investors to build on top of AngelList instead of a traditional VC. This will result in a more innovative, efficient & fair market. We\u2019re growing quickly (check out what we did in 2019 at angel.co/2019) and have exciting plans for 2020 and beyond. About the Role: We are looking to add a Senior Product Designer to our team in San Francisco. We have a unique product design culture where designers and engineers define and ship products together. Teams are small and built on mutual respect, high trust, and low management. At AngelList, designers and engineers take direct ownership of product experiences. It\u2019s not a fit for everyone, but when there\u2019s a fit, it\u2019s one of the most rewarding places to work. You will: Work within cross-functional (design, engineering, ops, legal) teams to iterate on existing products and invent new ones. Craft rational, elegant, and delightful solutions to complex problems in the financial/B2B space. Undertake user research, identifying mental models, needs, and pain points to inform feature development. Contribute to the design system to ensure cohesion across all our products. Take full ownership of the product. You will help scope, drive, and measure the success of multiple priorities against deadlines. Inspire the team by bringing new ideas to the table. Learn the venture financing business inside-out, from the ground up. You have: 5+ years of experience designing digital products and systems. Experience with prototyping as a means to communicate design solutions. The ability to work within visual design languages and experience contributing to them. Attention to detail and a data-driven approach to understanding what\u2019s required for great user experiences. A strong command of Sketch (for UI design). We also use Abstract for version control and InVision for feedback and prototypes. Excellent written and verbal communication skills. The ability to handle uncertainty and ambiguity well. You can make clear decisions with limited information. A growth mindset and comfort in regularly delivering and receiving peer feedback. An optimistic and idealistic worldview with a pragmatic work ethic. Started something on your own before \u2013 a startup, an open-source project, something else. A deep love of startups (https://venturehacks.com/save-the-world). If you\u2019re interested in joining us, but don\u2019t tick every box above, we\u2019d still encourage you to apply. We\u2019re building a diverse team whose skills balance and complement one another. We\u2019re happy to consider where you might be able to make the biggest impact. Benefits & Perks : At AngelList Venture, we have top of the line benefits to support our employees in their lives both inside and outside of work. See additional detail on our benefits here: https://angell.ist/venture-benefits . AngelList is an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity at our company.
