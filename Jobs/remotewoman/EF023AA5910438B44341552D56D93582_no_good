As the first all-in-one virtual venue for live online events, Hopin brings people together in a highly interactive and engaging online experience that feels just like an in-person event, only without the barriers. Whether it\u2019s a 50-person meetup, or a 50,000-person conference\u2014any type of event organizer can host a Hopin event for their attendees, speakers, sponsors, and vendors to convene, learn, and interact face-to-face online. We\u2019re spearheading the innovative technology that is enabling people to gather online like never before. Our mission is simple: better connections for a better planet. We believe in events without limits, but events that are sustainable and accessible to everyone\u2014and fun, too! To do this, we need passionate builders and storytellers to join us. Do you love people and technology and the magic that happens when they converge at scale? Do you have the skills and experience we\u2019re looking for to better serve our clients? If so, we\u2019d like to meet. We\u2019ve recently been funded by Accel, Northzone, Seedcamp, Web Summit\u2019s Fund, Slack Fund and a number of high-profile angel investors participated, including Supercell founder Ilkka Paananen, UiPath founder Daniel Dines, Intercom founder Des Traynor, GoCardless COO Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas and Miro founder Andrey Khusid. The role Hopin is seeking a software performance engineer to undertake regular performance profiling of its backend application, and to diagnose and find ways to fix scaling issues. Hopin\u2019s usage is growing at an enormous pace, and production traffic is increasing week over week. This brings the opportunity for the engineering team to stay ahead of anticipated production loads by creating simulated stress tests, and then quickly developing solutions to scale problems. The role is a hands-on role in the infrastructure team, but will involve working closely across all engineering teams to suggest and effect changes. Your day to day Building a deep understanding of the scalability and performance of Hopin\u2019s systems by automating performance tests to achieve our ambitious growth needs. Automating frequent performance tests and gathering and analyzing results. Working closely with other groups of engineers to solve scale and performance problems. Requirements At least 5 years of software engineering experience working on distributed systems at scale. Extensive experience running performance tests against systems, and organizing and sharing performance results. You\u2019ve scaled a system to support hundreds of thousands of concurrent users. Familiarity with distributed performance testing tools, such as Jmeter, Blazemeter, Flood.io and others. Excellent knowledge of PostgreSQL/RDS/Aurora and how to get the most out of it. Tuning experience around connection pools, thread pools, caches, load balancing and more. Experience automating complex multi-step processes. Experience with telemetry/diagnostic systems such as New Relic, DataDog and/or Honeycomb. More about you You work well in a very fast paced startup environment. Ideally you have experience tuning Ruby on Rails applications on Heroku or AWS. You probably have a computer science background, or something similar. You\u2019re a concise, accurate communicator. You dig deep to find out the facts and you support them with data. You\u2019re a great collaborator. You win support for your initiatives. You get others to effect changes by persuading whoever necessary. The Offer A competitive starting salary for this role with opportunity for bonuses as we scale. We are currently a remote team and for this position we are focusing on EMEA and East US Time zones. However, if you\u2019re based in London you can work with the Founder, Ops and the Tech Lead in the heart of Shoreditch.
