There are two things we want you to know when it comes to hiring. First, we\u2019re financially stable. We have a variety of well-established government contracts that we expect to continue over the next few years. Also, we\u2019re winning new work, and we have a robust rainy day fund. Second, during video interviews, you\u2019ll likely see more of our human side. Family members, partners, kids and pets are home with some of us! We promise to be present and engaged, but we may be a little\u2026harried. It\u2019s OK if you are, too \u2013 we understand that everyone is experiencing extra stress right now. If you have any questions along the way, please let us know, and stay healthy and safe. ** Truss is tackling tough technical problems for the private sector and government. We practice and advocate modern development practices to build software and streamline infrastructure. Truss is a software consultancy known for pragmatism, autonomy, expertise, and trust. We build strong relationships with our clients, contractors and employees and we believe that this is fundamental to doing great work. As an entry level IT Specialist you will facilitate bringing our values by providing services end users at Truss truly need. We are seeking a driven, curious, and quick-learning IT Specialist to join our team. We are looking for an entry level specialist to pair with senior staff and handle the internal IT challenges we regularly face as a growing distributed company. A position with Truss will allow you to develop a rich skill-set working in an energetic environment that prioritizes work/life balance with a team of curious, helpful people. A note on location: because of the current shelter-in-place order for the Bay Area due to covid-19, we\u2019re temporarily suspending requirements to come into a physical office 1-2 times per week and will reinstate once it\u2019s safe. We are still seeking a locally-based hire. If selected for hire, we\u2019ll onboard you remotely. Here\u2019s what we hope you\u2019ll bring: Great communication, including thoughtful listening skills, the ability to express complex ideas clearly and succinctly, and the ability to communicate well in writing A thoughtful, process-oriented approach to asset and software management, such as inventory tracking, testing and debugging new software, and automation Have held at least one IT position during or post-education Experience deploying at least one application that other people use Technology-agnostic and pragmatic engineering sensibility, focused on solving key problems Initiative with a bias for action In this position you will: Deliver timely, high quality solutions to specific asset management problems internal to Truss Create automated processes for Truss or be willing to learn to do so Deploy changes to existing Truss systems to support new functionality Evaluate and select tools to meet project needs without creating unnecessary technical debt Manage daily IT office tasks including user access, ordering, shipping and deliveries of user systems and IT equipment Cross-train with other Truss engineers via infrastructure and security discussions Discover other practice areas at Truss and choose a path for mentorship and professional development If you have more experience than is reflected here, that\u2019s great! We\u2019ll be pleased to exercise your broader/deeper skill set. This is, however, a junior level position to be staffed for 12-15 months as a path toward advancement to another relevant and distributed practice area at Truss (e.g. Engineering, Infrastructure, Security). We value inclusion and welcome diverse viewpoints. You must be eligible to work in the US. Unfortunately, we are unable to sponsor work visas at this time. We encourage all interested candidates to apply!
