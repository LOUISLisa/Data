THE BASICS These are woven into the DNA of every Buff. Humble: our team knows that we don\u2019t know everything. When you come on board with WP Buffs, we expect you to admit when you make errors, ask when you don\u2019t know the answer and always tell the truth.

Together, we\u2019ll win the day. It\u2019s just that easy. ABOUT YOU Being a great fit here is just as much about you as it is us. You\u2019ve worked remotely: you\u2019ve done remote work before and teamed up with a distributed team. You\u2019re a self-starter: you don\u2019t need permission to get work done. You choose action over inactivity. You can follow detailed instructions: much of our work is systematized. Reading and following directions is a strength. You\u2019re friendly: being polite, smiling and laughing are important parts of your day. You want to improve: making yourself a little bit better each and every day is what drives you. You\u2019re self-accountable: you don\u2019t need anybody micromanaging the quality of your work because you are your own hardest critic.

That means regular check ins and making sure every side of the business is talking regularly.\u201d Allie Nimmons, Customer Success Manager, Miami, USA \u201cOur new customer success hire understands that growing the business doesn\u2019t just stem from new customer and partner acquisition, but expanding existing accounts and upgrading current customers.
