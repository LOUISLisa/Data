The salary range will be adjusted based on cost of living data for folks who live in less expensive regions. Here\u2019s why: we feel strongly that progressive organizations should optimize for a consistent standard of living for all employees. About VoteAmerica VoteAmerica is a female founded nonprofit organization with a small team of elections and technology experts (including the founders of Vote.org and Vote.gov), who have come together to combat the chaos of the 2020 election cycle by helping to to drive record-shattering voter turnout. We will accomplish this via hyper-aggressive and targeted outreach to the millions of low and no-propensity voters who are generally neglected by partisan groups. This isn\u2019t just empty rhetoric: collectively we\u2019ve registered about 20 million voters and run GOTV to tens of millions more in our past roles. Now we\u2019re scaling up. What we\u2019re looking for: VoteAmerica is seeking a full-time Senior Software Engineer that can commit to a six month employment term to take a leading role in the development of Get Out The Vote web applications, primarily by architecting, developing, and deploying high-quality Python and React code to Amazon Web Services. The ideal candidate will have a passion for increasing voter participation, while being comfortable working collaboratively and swiftly on a small, all-remote engineering and product team. This position is an opportunity to develop new software products on tight deadlines to drive as many Americans as possible to the polls.

We currently use Django and React, and trust every engineer to jump in where needed Familiarity with Amazon Web Service and working in the AWS console Bonus points if you have: Experience with container-orchestration systems such as Kubernetes or Elastic Container Service Experience building civic participation tools Prior political, campaign, or organizing experience strongly preferred A passion for increasing civic participation during the 2020 election and beyond Some of the benefits of working here: Outspoken, queer, female CEO Short commute.
