We build tools to ease these decisions by presenting solutions that span the gaps. Our tools manage both physical machines and virtual machines, Windows, and Linux, SaaS and IaaS, etc. About the role: As part of the Cloud organization, you\u2019ll be a key part of a newly formed team tasked with building out our Identity and Access Management (IAM) services. This is a chance to make a large impact across the team and company, defining how our customers access our products securely. You\u2019ll work closely with product managers, designers, and other engineers to get this project off the ground and into production. In this role, you can expect to: Contribute to the design and implementation of extremely large-scale systems. Interface directly with internal teams, users, and HashiCorp customers. Work with multiple cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, and Azure. Work with HashiCorp products such as Terraform, Consul, Vault, and Nomad. You may be a good fit for our team if you have: You have a background in full-stack or back-end engineering Have integrated with an Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) platform, such as Auth0, Otka, or similar iDPs Familiar with role based access control (RBAC) Experience with audited resource access You are familiar with micro-service architectures, and ideally, have seen them in operation on a global scale. Have a strong understanding of security principles. You have prior experience working in high performance or distributed systems; while we strive to hire at a variety of experience levels, this particular opening is not well-suited for recent graduates. You are able to knowledgeably discuss design and performance tradeoffs in complex systems. HashiCorp embraces diversity and equal opportunity. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe the more inclusive we are, the better our company will be. #LI-AZ1 If this job interests you but you aren\u2019t certain if you meet all of theÂ requirements, apply anyway!
