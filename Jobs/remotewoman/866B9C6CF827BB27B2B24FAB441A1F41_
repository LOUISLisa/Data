We believe that the GOP\u2019s bad behavior disproportionately hurts the most marginalized people in society \u2014 including people of color, people from working-class backgrounds, people with disabilities, women and LGBTQ people. We believe that these communities must be centered in the work we do. Hence, we strongly encourage applications from people with these identities and members of other marginalized communities.
