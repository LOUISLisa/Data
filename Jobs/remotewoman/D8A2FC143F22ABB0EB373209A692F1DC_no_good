We believe that businesses only succeed by using their time intentionally. Our products support our customers through time tracking, reporting, and forecasting features. Harvest started in 2006 as a team of three and has grown to today\u2019s current team of almost 60 with Harvesters working from around the globe. We\u2019ve worked as a remote team since the beginning and we continue to hire the right people for the job no matter where they call home. We also strive to create a workplace culture where everyone feels valued, included, and heard. One important aspect of this is continuing to create spaces for diverse life experiences and work histories. If you are a member of a group that is historically underrepresented and disadvantaged in tech, business, and society in general, we want to meet you and we encourage you to apply. Why We\u2019re Hiring The Harvest Engineering Department currently consists of three teams: Developers, Operations, and QA. The 10 Developers work in cycles on rotating teams and at the moment, all report directly to our Head of Engineering. As this team continues to grow, we will create teams within Development that each have a more specific focus on Ecosystem, Native Apps, and Web Apps. We are currently looking for an Engineering Manager to join us and lead the Ecosystem team at Harvest. Engineering Manager Responsibilities As an Engineering Manager, you will help build and grow the Ecosystem team as the latest team within Harvest Engineering. The Ecosystem team will focus on our public API, partner integrations and supporting backend services. This team will also be responsible for building and maintaining supporting tools such as SDKs, documentation sites, embedded widgets, browser extensions, API explorers, validators and much more. The API and supporting tools are the foundation for our partner integrations and are critical components to a healthy and thriving ecosystem. What You\u2019ll Do Recruit, hire, retain and lead a highly motivated engineering team. Cultivate a learning organization with a bias towards shipping. Support the engineers reporting into you by meeting with them regularly, providing timely feedback and working with them on growing their skills and helping them reach their career goals. Collaborate with peers in Product, QA and Operations to ensure quality delivery of features. Own the technical roadmap for our public API, integrations and supporting backend services. Succinctly communicate progress regarding active projects to the engineering leadership team, internal partner teams and the company at large. Who You Are You are an empathetic technical leader who ideally is deeply interested in APIs and using them to extend the capabilities of other applications. You have worked as a remote employee before and preferably as a manager. You value a distributed and diverse work culture. Working side-by-side with co-workers from around the world is something you cherish. You have experience with JavaScript and at least one other language (preferably Ruby or Go). While you will not be expected to write code as part of your day-to-day, you will need to be able to read code as part of code and documentation reviews. What You\u2019ve Done 3+ years experience as an Engineering Manager or as a technical lead for a team of 4 or more. Strong project, process and people management skills. Able to work cross-functionally on and with a distributed team. Working knowledge of various API approaches such as REST, hypermedia, gRPC, GraphQL, etc. Experience designing, building, maintaining and operating a production API service. Familiarity with supporting API tools such as live documentation, API explorers, SDKs and API monitoring. Prior experience building and maintaining these tools is a plus. Working knowledge of modern frontend engineering techniques, particularly with respect to component-based approaches (e.g. React) to user experience. When You Apply Please apply online at: https://apply.workable.com/harvest/j/BAB2F34550/. In your cover letter, please include responses to the following: Why did you decide to apply to Harvest specifically? What unique work experiences or professional perspectives would you bring to the team? Do you believe managing a distributed team requires a different approach than managing a team in-person?
