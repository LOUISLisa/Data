Learn more at elastic.co A strong search experience in web applications is a must-have and yet it is hard to implement and even harder to perfect. Providing the right piece of content or the perfect product to a potential customer requires insight and effort. Elastic App Search harnesses the power of Elasticsearch for best-in-class relevance right out-of-the-gate. Not only does App Search include typo-tolerance, stemming, bigram and phrase matching, but it also offers search customization features such as Curations, Weights, Boosts, and Synonyms for you to fine-tune relevance based on your business objectives in conjunction with data available via Analytics. Elastic App Search is available as a self-managed package or quickly deployed via Elastic Cloud. We\u2019re seeking a talented software engineer, communicator, and leader to help us continue our mission to provide the best search experience on the market. What You Will Be Doing: You will build next-generation search products and scale advanced distributed systems, such as our web crawler. You will collaborate with and mentor international teammates in a mostly text-based, asynchronous, remote-first team environment with occasional video calls and twice-yearly in-person conferences. You\u2019ll be hands-on with the team and codebase, reviewing work and providing constructive feedback. You will help define the team\u2019s overall strategy, collaborating on a product roadmap and then breaking it into technical deliverables. You\u2019ll act as an important and communicative part of an engaged and spirited team. Our Team Style: We appreciate articulate and \u201clow ego\u201d people who want to grow as part of a team. We welcome diversity in all forms, thought above all. We embrace strange and risky ideas and appreciate characters of all sorts. We hold each other accountable and work to a high standard. We take pride in the frequent, safe and graceful delivery of innovative and valuable features. We embrace open communication and challenge. We appreciate positivity and vigilance and strive for autonomy, trust, and personal and professional growth. Our stack is in Ruby, Java/JRuby, and JavaScript. We welcome any language background and get deep into Elasticsearch. What You Will Bring: Previous experience in a technical leadership role wherein you defined product goals and iterated them into scaled software. You understand that what you build needs to empower and engage the customer, the person. Excellent practical judgement. You know how to prioritize, when to collaborate and ask for help, and when to be independent. Measured and articulate written and spoken communication skills. You work well with others and can craft concise and expressive thoughts into correspondence: issues, investigations, documentation and onboarding material. An interest in learning new tools, languages, workflows and philosophies that can help you grow. You can function well in an environment that drives towards change. If this sounds interesting, we would love to hear from you! Please include whatever info you believe is relevant: resume, GitHub profile, code samples, blog posts and writing samples, links to personal projects, etc. Additional Information \u2013 We Take Care of Our People As a distributed company, diversity drives our identity.
