This includes everything from eliminating boring things from your daily workflow by automating them, to upgrading a multi-petabyte Hadoop cluster to the next upstream version without impacting uptime and users. We\u2019re looking for an experienced candidate who\u2019s excited about working with big data systems. Ideally you will already have some experience working with software like Hadoop, Kafka, ElasticSearch, Spark and other members of the distributed computing world. Since you\u2019ll be joining an existing team of SREs you\u2019ll have plenty of space and opportunities to get familiar with our tech (Analytics, Search, WDQS), so there\u2019s no need to immediately have the answer to every question. We are a full-time distributed team with no one working out of the actual Wikimedia office, so we are all together in the same remote boat. Part of the team is in Europe and part in the United States. We see each other in person two or three times a year, either during one of our off-sites (most recently in Europe), the Wikimedia All Hands (once a year), or Wikimania, the annual international conference for the Wiki community. Here are some examples of projects we\u2019ve been tackling lately that you might be involved with: Integrating an open-source GPU software platform like AMD ROCm in Hadoop and in the Tensorflow-related ecosystem Improving the security of our data by adding Kerberos authentication to the analytics Hadoop cluster and its satellite systems Scaling the Wikidata query service, a semantic query endpoint for graph databases Building the Foundation\u2019s new event data platform infrastructure Implementing alarms that alert the team of possible data loss or data corruption Building a new and improved Jupyter notebooks ecosystem for the Foundation and the community to use Building and deploying services in Kubernetes with Helm Upgrading the cluster to Hadoop 3 Replacing Oozie by Airflow as a workflow scheduler And these are our more formal requirements: Couple years experience in an SRE/Operations/DevOps role as part of a team Experience in supporting complex web applications running highly available and high traffic infrastructure based on Linux Comfortable with configuration management and orchestration tools (Puppet, Ansible, Chef, SaltStack, etc.), and modern observability infrastructure (monitoring, metrics and logging) An appetite for the automation and streamlining of tasks Willingness to work with JVM-based systems Comfortable with shell and scripting languages used in an SRE/Operations engineering context (e.g. Python, Go, Bash, Ruby, etc.) Good understanding of Linux/Unix fundamentals and debugging skills Strong English language skills and ability to work independently, as an effective part of a globally distributed team B.S. or M.S. in Computer Science, related field or equivalent in related work experience. Do not feel you need a degree to apply; we value hands-on experience most of all. The Wikimedia Foundation is\u2026 \u2026the nonprofit organization that hosts and operates Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia free knowledge projects. Our vision is a world in which every single human can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. We believe that everyone has the potential to contribute something to our shared knowledge, and that everyone should be able to access that knowledge, free of interference.
