As a progressive organization we will adjust the salary range according to the market and cost of living where you reside to optimize for consistent standards of living for all employees. About VoteAmerica VoteAmerica is a nonpartisan nonprofit that works to ensure that democracy still exists in the United States in 2021. We focus on increasing voter turnout by identifying and clearing roadblocks to voter participation. Given decades of active voter suppression, a global pandemic, hostile foreign interference, hostile domestic interference, the partisan hijacking of the DOJ, record-high joblessness, civil unrest, and about a dozen other things, we have our work cut out for us. Fortunately, we\u2019re not fucking around over here. We\u2019re a new org staffed by long-time politicos and voter turnout experts, and we\u2019re looking for other folks who aren\u2019t fucking around to join us. Learn more about our team here: www.voteamerica.com/team. Role Overview VoteAmerica is seeking a full time Product Manager (or Senior Product Manager) to take the lead in managing and prioritizing the end-to-end development of our voter registration, vote-by-mail, and get-out-the-vote (GOTV) web applications. You\u2019ll work across teams (program, research, fundraising, and partnerships) to identify areas where technology can drive innovation and efficiency. To thrive in this role, the candidate will be an expert problem-solver, with a background that supports a healthy mix of product strategist and project manager. With less than 150 days left until Election Day, you\u2019ll be tasked with becoming a domain expert in a short period of time \u2014 scouring election codes, speaking with election administrators, and holding your own in a room of voter turnout experts. An adept project manager, you\u2019ll be at home managing the product roadmap collaboratively with a team of all-remote engineers, building a system of planning and reflection that drives the iterative process without skipping a beat. The ideal candidate will be comfortable regularly alternating between 30,000 ft strategic guidance and perfecting our UX/UI experience down to the smallest of improvements. You\u2019ll be working primarily with the Tech team in partnership with the Director of Technology, who has had nearly 15 years\u2019 experience developing civic-focused technologies and web tools. You\u2019ll also have a lot of interaction with our CEO, a long-time product manager. This is both good (she\u2019s great!) and potentially irritating (she\u2019s very good at your job!), but it\u2019ll be fine, promise. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll be working on: Define product strategy: Develop product strategy for a full-suite of voter turnout tools that solve real-time gaps in election technology. Work effectively with customers, partners, executives, stakeholders, and Technology teams to build a well defined and integrated roadmap to deliver on the strategy. Know your customer: Our customer is the voter. You\u2019ll bring your political acumen together with a sharp technical sense to build tools that optimize for usability and accessibility. Drive product lifecycle: Collaborate with Technology, Program, and Partnership teams to drive the product lifecycle from concept to customer success; Define and prioritize the backlog for engineering teams, write the user stories, and do whatever it takes to fuel the productivity and effectiveness of the engineering teams. Think strategically and make smart decisions: Analyze and synthesize the breakthroughs happening across the civic technology space, with an eye towards innovation. Act as a thought partner: Embed yourself across teams, specifically Program and Research, to act as a technical advisor, drive innovation, and scale identified solutions. You should meet several of the following minimum requirements: 5+ years of progressive responsibility and experience as a Product Manager or similar role working on a user-facing web application Experience creating strategic product roadmaps, allocating limited resources under tight deadlines, and working with cross-functional teams to establish priorities Strong interpersonal and communications skills\u2014able to communicate fluently with both technical and nontechnical staff, and drive clarity in cross-team discussions Exceptional project management skills Bonus points if you have: Background in the foundations of UX/UI design Prior experience working in politics, activism, or online organizing Double bonus points for experience building voter turnout technology A deep and abiding love for open source technology Some of the benefits of working here: Outspoken, queer, female founder and CEO Short commute. We all work from home and it is just the best. Parent friendly policies. If you need to take 3-5pm off every day to get your kids from school and make after school snacks, we\u2019re totally cool with that. Excellent medical coverage. Full health, dental, and vision for employees and generous employer subsidies for dependent children. Generous time off. Unlimited paid vacation with leadership approval. Retirement. We offer a 401(k) because we want you to retire one day. Highly competent, down to earth, and humble team. Awesome slack channels. #pets, #politics, #memes and #random are our favs. How to apply: You\u2019ll need a resume and the ability to answer a handful of short questions. We don\u2019t require a cover letter, because you don\u2019t want to write one and we don\u2019t want to read one. Applications are processed on a rolling basis, and we will accept applications until the role is filled. We are, however, looking to fill this role ASAP, so you should apply as soon as you can.
