As more and more enterprise customers use GitHub Enterprise, GitHub\u2019s support team grows. The Enterprise Support team accepts operational technical inquiries from enterprise customers. Our goal is to answer these inquiries as promptly and politely as possible and to guide you in solving the problem. We are looking for an engineer who can provide Japanese technical support as part of a team in charge of the Asia Pacific region.

The main function of this position is to solve the problem in Japanese through a support ticket issued by a Japanese customer through a web interface. Support tickets are usually raised by a company\u2019s system administrator. The content covers a wide range, such as requesting investigations on the load of GitHub Enterprise Server instances, investigating network problems, debugging application errors, and responding to feature requests. At the same time, we will work with the engineering team to prioritize product development and issues, and with the documentation team to improve the help documentation published to our customers.
