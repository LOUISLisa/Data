We build tools to ease these decisions by presenting solutions that span the gaps. Our tools manage both physical machines and virtual machines, Windows, and Linux, SaaS and IaaS, etc. Engineering at HashiCorp is largely a remote team. While prior experience working remotely isn\u2019t required, we are looking for team members who perform well given a high level of independence and autonomy. Our Team Cloud Services is an exciting team delivering HashiCorp products as fully-managed Cloud services. We work across the company, and with multiple cloud partners, to make using HashiCorp products simple for our customers. We\u2019re a small, but rapidly growing team, making a huge impact. This Position You\u2019ll be a part of a cross-functional group, contributing to our cloud products across our UI, CLI, and back-end services. This is a generalist role with the opportunity to grow into either more front-end work or back-end depending on your interests and experience. In this role, you can expect to: Work across our product, on both the front-end (Ember) and back-end (Golang). Work with HashiCorp products such as Terraform, Consul, Vault, and Nomad. Work with multiple cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, and Azure. Interface directly with internal teams, users, and HashiCorp customers. Be a part of a distributed team (we\u2019re in NA and Europe). Contribute to the design and implementation of extremely large-scale systems. Support the applications you build by being a part of an on-call rotation. You may be a good fit if: You have experience with a front-end technology (Ember, Angular, React, etc). You have experience with a back-end technology (Go, Java, Ruby, Node, etc). You are familiar with micro-services architectures. You are able to knowledgeably discuss design and performance tradeoffs in complex systems. About the Application Process Please note, as communication is a critical aspect of how we work, a cover letter is a great way to provide a sample of how you communicate. In your cover letter, describe why you\u2019re interested in working at HashiCorp, and what draws you to this role in particular. HashiCorp embraces diversity and equal opportunity. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe the more inclusive we are, the better our company will be. #LI-AZ1q Apply for job Apply for job If this job interests you but you aren\u2019t certain if you meet all of theÂ requirements, apply anyway!
