    "Body": " Welcome! Thank you for your interest in BambooHR ! Interested in our Talent Acquisition team but can't find any current openings on our careers page? You've come to the right place. We don't hire for our team as much as others, but we're fans of Talent Pools, and would love to know who we should consider for future growth on our team. We hope you use this open application to let us know if you're interested, and to tell us more about your skill-sets. Make sure to read everything carefully below, and thanks again! About Us Our mission is simple: we want to set people free to do meaningful work. People love our software--and it turns out that people love working here too. We've been recognized as a \" Best Company to Work For ,\" and we're proud of our team for receiving awards for workplace effectiveness and flexibility.

We're growing a lot, so we love considering people in the future who have already seen the great things that Bamboo has to offer! One of our Talent Ambassadors will contact you when and if we open a position that would be the best fit for your experience . In the meantime, feel free to connect with Sarah Bradshaw on LinkedIn. She will be the main point of contact for hiring new Talent Acquisition Partners. Things we'd ask of you: 1) We want you to find the right future position that is best suited to your skills and future aspirations, so please make sure you don't submit an application here unless you are really looking to invest in a career in Talent Acquisition and Recruiting. We don't want both applications to get lost in the shuffle, and that will help us give you a closer look and fair consideration. 2) Make sure you tell us about your interests and the kind of recruiting you consider yourself most qualified to jump into. What's your wheelhouse? Your passion? What kind of work really drives you? Why do you love Talent Acquisition itself? Positions can sometimes be pretty competitive here, so this will allow us to look into Talent Acquisition positions that would be the best for your interests, passions, and abilities.
