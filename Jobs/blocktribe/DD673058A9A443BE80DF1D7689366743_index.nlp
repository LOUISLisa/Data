We are proud to offer an entire suite of products that are helping build the cryptoeconomy, and increase economic freedom around the world. There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we assess whether a candidate demonstrates our values: Clear Communication, Positive Energy, Efficient Execution, and Continuous Learning. Second, we look for signals that a candidate will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, disrupt ourselves, and expect sustained high performance because we play as a championship team. Finally, we seek people with the desire and capacity to build and share expertise in the frontier technologies of crypto and blockchain, in whatever way is most relevant to their role. Read more about our values and culture here. The Reliability Engineering team helps realize that vision by supporting Coinbase engineering teams to build software that is world-class in terms of its reliability. As a core service team, the Coinbase Reliability Engineers work closely with the rest of engineering. We actively seek out and gather the state-of-the-art, best practices from the industry at large. Through education and advocacy, we seek to ensure that reliability is a core value of our engineering culture. We level up other engineers by sharing deep knowledge, performing proactive analysis and improving processes, tools, and automation. Ultimately, Reliability Engineering succeeds when all engineering teams are able to build reliable software on their own. We're looking for a Staff Software Engineer to balance the role of an individual contributor while also anchoring new projects, leading technical direction and mentoring other engineers on the team. We highly value individuals with intellectual curiosity and openness. We collaborate across the organization, helping our engineers think big and take risks while building a culture of diversity, positive energy and blameless truth-seeking.
