    "Body": " Location: San Francisco, CA Coinbase has built the world's leading compliant cryptocurrency platform serving over 30 million accounts in more than 100 countries. With multiple successful products, and our vocal advocacy for blockchain technology, we have played a major part in mainstream awareness and adoption of cryptocurrency. We are proud to offer an entire suite of products that are helping build the cryptoeconomy, and increase economic freedom around the world. There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we assess whether a candidate demonstrates our values: Clear Communication, Positive Energy, Efficient Execution, and Continuous Learning. Second, we look for signals that a candidate will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, disrupt ourselves, and expect sustained high performance because we play as a championship team. Finally, we seek people with the desire and capacity to build and share expertise in the frontier technologies of crypto and blockchain, in whatever way is most relevant to their role. Read more about our values and culture here. Security is a primary competency at Coinbase, and the Security Operations team keeps a watchful eye over every aspect of it. Every day, we go to battle against some of the most sophisticated attackers in the world to protect billions of dollars worth of digital assets and ensure that our customers and employees can enjoy a safe, trusted experience. As Coinbase scales globally, our team is scaling along with it, using a blend of tooling, automation, and strategic team growth to ensure that we're well-equipped to protect the next billion users of crypto. What you'll be doing (ie. job duties): The Security Operations group is a multi-functional organization that includes our CSIRT, Trust & Safety, and Threat Intelligence. While no two days will end up looking the same, generally-speaking you'll be responsible for the following things: Growing and mentoring a team of talented analysts Defining and hitting key performance metrics for your team Ensuring that Trust & Safety has a voice at the table with key partner teams like Product, Customer Experience, Legal, and Payments Risk Fostering close collaboration with our Threat Intelligence and Global Investigations teams to identify bad actors targeting our customers and bring them to justice?? What we look for in you (ie. job requirements): Some security teams have strict requirements about certifications, degrees, years of experience, and things like that. Not us! We're more interested in the unique perspectives and expertise you'll bring to the team, rather than the acronyms on your resume. However, you'll be much more likely to be successful in this role if these bullet points seem like a good description of you: You've been leading anti-abuse, trust and safety, or fraud and risk teams for a while now, probably in the realm of 5+ years. Working with a global team doesn't phase you. You've hired lots of people for trust and safety roles before, and can pick out great talent from the crowd. Every team you've managed has gotten high marks for performance and job satisfaction. You frequently get praise from your peers and coworkers about your communication skills, both written and verbal. You take a data-driven approach to prioritization and solving problems, and can answer a lot of your own questions using SQL. Pressure doesn't get to you, even in high-intensity situations or environments. Nice to haves: You would bring a diverse perspective to the team: for example,?? maybe you took an unconventional route to get into your current trust and safety career. You've got a passing familiarity with blockchains and cryptocurrency, or at least a good story about how you thought about investing in Bitcoin in 2014 but decided not to. You know that attackers rarely target a platform in isolation, and have built a strong network of industry peers that you can tap for insights.
