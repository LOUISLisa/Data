    "Body": " We\u2019re a fast-moving cryptocurrency media and software startup looking for a motivated, driven and resourceful T-shaped Growth Marketer to join our Marketing team in Hong Kong. Our Story When CoinFi cofounder Tim quit his job as a hedge fund manager to trade cryptocurrency full-time, he realized there was a lack of institutional calibre research and trading tools like he was accustomed to on Wall Street. Together with his fellow cofounders Han and Nate, Tim realized there was a big gap in the market that we could solve with a new type of crypto market intelligence platform. We quickly got to work and in Aug 2017 launched a token sale. This culminated in Jan 2018 when we raised $15M USD to grow our cryptocurrency media and software startup. Thanks to the token sale, we already have a subscriber list of 80,000+ readers and a telegram community of 23,000+ crypto investors. While it\u2019s still early, we\u2019re on our way to becoming the leading provider of trading intelligence for the cryptocurrency markets. What\u2019s the Opportunity? We\u2019re building a market intelligence platform for crypto investors, and we cannot succeed without having world-class talent who can help us scale up our user acquisition, activation, and retention. As a Growth Marketer at CoinFi, you\u2019ll be a growth pioneer in the crypto space, helping us win the race to build the dominant market intelligence platform for the crypto markets. You\u2019ll be supported by colleagues who not only have subject matter expertise in cryptocurrencies and trading, but who highly appreciate the key role that growth plays in product success. We see growth and product as two sides of the same coin (pun intended!). Get in on the ground floor of an ambitious startup - we\u2019re on a mission to be the go-to resource in every crypto trader\u2019s workflow. We have a serious warchest and a team with the right experience to execute on this vision. Your mission (should you choose to accept) as Growth Marketer at CoinFi is to help us identify scalable marketing channels and bake growth into the product, using your skills and creativity to put a rocket engine behind CoinFi\u2019s growth. What\u2019s It Like Working with Us? We\u2019re a fast moving startup, not a lifestyle business. We have capital and a big mission, we\u2019re looking for top performers to join us as we step on the gas and get things done quickly. Growing this business is something we think about around the clock, and in this position it should be something you think about a lot as well. We\u2019re committed to working as a team to create a truly exceptional product. At the same time, we do believe in being productive, not busy. Team members aren\u2019t expected to come into the office on weekends or holidays. We value continuous learning, self improvement and self-reflection. We like to share ideas and engage in healthy debate - there are no sacred cows - we approach new ideas with an open mind and evaluate them from first principles. If you\u2019re looking to stop thinking about work by 5PM everyday, this role isn\u2019t for you. But if you love growth marketing, learning new things, have an interest in cryptocurrencies, and want to help build something transformative in an exciting growth industry with a team of easy-going, but high-performing people - then you\u2019ll fit right in! What Will You Be Doing? You\u2019ll be working closely with our CMO, Head of Content Marketing, product team, and data science team, using your expertise in growth marketing, digital marketing channels, and a deep understanding of our customer pain points to exponentially scale up user acquisition and retention for CoinFi.

Are passionate about growth marketing: you obsessively follow top blogs and read books in the growth space.
