    "Body": " We're looking for people who can engage contributors, users and all sorts of stakeholders on Reddit and Bitcointalk. Compensation is per-post, $0.50 up to $2.50 USD for the highest quality as judged by AI algorithms monitored by humans. There are unlimited amounts of posts to make, so long as they truly engage and add value. This allows you to earn as much as you put in, up to $25.00 per hour or more if you're prolific and write great, engaging content. You'll be coached by a community engagement veteran with keen insights on how to improve your quality score and earn more. There will also be internal processes to follow to ensure that everyone's social accounts gain karma, member status upgrades and become more powerful over time. There's a logarithmic scale for assigning quality values to comments by agents. This means that the difference between a score of 60%-61% is the same as the difference in score of 50%-60%. The better you get, the harder it is to earn a higher score. These scores are divided into three \u2018tiers\u2019 for payment. Tier 3, or the lowest quality, risks your ability to stay on the team. When applying, send along your reddit profile and bitcointalk profile summary. Thanks! Skills Reddit, Bitcointalk, communication, support Compensation Pay for Performance ",
