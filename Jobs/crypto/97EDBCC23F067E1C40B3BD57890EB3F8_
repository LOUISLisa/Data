    "Body": " Software Engineer Technical Lead Symetria.io | 1780-555 Hastings Street West, Vancouver, BC | On-site Only Who we are: We are Symetria, a centralized crypto-to-crypto wallet & exchange provider that uses Personal Blockchains (our tech) to form private blockchains between us and each of our users. What this does is provide immutable proof for every action taken on our site, enabling us to offer the fairness of a decentralized process while maintaining the speed and privacy of a centralized exchange. We\u2019re a funded startup, nearing the initial launch of our MVP. Where we are: We have a clean codebase relying on Microsoft technologies. We\u2019ve been using C# 7.3 to build out .NET Standard 2.0 libraries to support an ASP.NET Core 2.0 website and some other back-end services hosted on Azure or in Docker containers. Of course, our web front-end is HTML/CSS/Javascript, and we\u2019re relatively lightweight in terms of framework dependencies. We have a beautiful and intuitive user experience created by our incredibly talented in-house design director. Throughout development, we\u2019ve come up with so many fantastic ideas for features and future plans, and we need to build out the right team to get great things done. What we need: We need someone to study where we\u2019re at, where we\u2019re going, how we do things and why we do them \u2013 and then pick up from there. As our Tech Lead you\u2019ll be empowered to build out your own team and responsible for managing them to meet our goals. We\u2019ve developed the codebase, but we\u2019re not married to it, so if you have better ideas, we\u2019re all ears. We envision you growing to own and oversee the entire tech stack and moving into a Director level role as we grow. You\u2019ll set out standards as you see fit and lead your team of developers to get things done according to your standards. If our founder contributes code too, it\u2019s under the standards you\u2019ve laid out. We trust you.
