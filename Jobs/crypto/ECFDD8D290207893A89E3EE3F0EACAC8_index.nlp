    "Body": " About Conflux Conflux is a next generation blockchain network that solves the blockchain trilemma \u2013 scalability, decentralization, and security \u2013 that taken together make possible a universal public infrastructure for our digital economy. The team endeavours to provide the world with an open permissionless blockchain network that will underpin a next generation internet and financial infrastructure. It is currently the world\u2019s highest performing Proof-of-Work (PoW) public blockchain with transaction throughput that exceeds 3,500 transactions per second and confirmation times of between 20-30 seconds. Conflux was founded by world renowned computer scientists from Tsinghua University and University of Toronto, including Turing Award winner Dr. Andrew Yao, winner of the prestigious and Dr. Fan Long, a two-time gold medalist in the International Olympiad of Informatics & Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto. The core team is comprised of prominent and well-recognized scientists in the fields of distributed systems, programming languages, cyber security, cryptography, and game theory from some of the top universities in the world including Tsinghua University, MIT, UC Berkeley, and Carnegie Mellon University. The team is backed by Sequoia Capital, MetaStable Capital, Baidu Ventures, IMO Ventures, Huobi, Shunwei Capital, Frees Fund, Fundamental Labs and IOSG Ventures. What You\u2019ll Do We seek a talented technical researcher with a passion to understand and experiment with foundational infrastructure for our new digital economy; someone that desires work on the bleeding edge of P2P and networking technologies. A key function of the role will involve supporting engineering teams with \u201cproblems-to-be\u201d by finding solutions before the problems hit the operational systems and networks. You\u2019ll conduct research to enhance network resilience while ensuring the network can evolve to meet new requirements over time. In addition, you'll work directly with external developer communities currently interested in or already building on top of Conflux to help them get the most out of our technology. You'll be responsible for creating and explaining solutions; helping integrate our developer tools, APIs, and smart contracts where necessary; and owning a feedback loop in order to improve our tools and protocol over time. Specific responsibilities include: - Set the research agenda in alignment with development collaborators - Keep an overview of research topics and participate in research when needed Initiate and manage research collaborations - Coordinate efforts to deliver high quality research papers along with good internal documentation - Collaborate with many other research labs and individual researchers in the field Lead ecosystem development efforts: identify, engage, and onboard key projects that would benefit from incorporating Conflux - Attend and represent Conflux at academic and developer conferences - Zealously advocate, through conferences, blogs, customer visits, and social media, for Conflux, its developer offerings, and its vision. About You - Obsession with the future of blockchain technology, web3, and low-level protocol development - Deep and broad blockchain knowledge, such as security, consensus protocols, emerging Layer-2 solutions, DeFi, etc - An open minded research approach and genuine intellectual curiosity - A degree in a technical area (i.e. mathematics, engineering or computer science) and/or technical experience is strongly preferred - Fluid communicator of both aspirational vision and technically deep material Nice to Haves: - Deep understanding of computer science, distributed systems, consensus algorithms, networking, game theory and other relevant fields to blockchain technology; you are a visionary who can see a clear future of Web 3 despite the ever-present noise - Knowledge of conventional financial systems and services, ideally from an implementation or product design perspective, such as broker/dealers, exchanges, quantitative analysis or high-frequency trading algorithms, margin and leverage, etc. - Advanced degree (Master\u2019s and/or PhD) in math, computer science, statistics, engineering, or similar disciplines. How to Apply We thank all applicants for their interest in Conflux; however, only chosen applicants will be contacted. We look for people with unique perspectives and diverse backgrounds.
