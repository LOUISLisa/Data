In the 21st century our freedom as individuals will no longer be dictated by geographical constraints, financial institutions, and ultimately lessen the tyranny of the birth lottery. Despite the technology being at such a nascent stage blockchain industry has seen unprecedented growth. In 2017 alone the industry grew by 3,100%. People call Bitcoin a bubble. The total market cap is currently worth $321 billion (as of 30/05/2018)1, which pales in comparison to the dotcom bubble which was worth $3 trillion, despite not having any new or existing technology backing the absurd total market value. While Bitcoin itself may not be the most valued asset in the world in the near future, it is undeniable that the applications of blockchain technology reach far further than for simple uses such as executing transactions. Blockchain technology will become a powerful mechanism for shaping the validity of identification, the creation of smart contracts and the way in which ownership is branded on assets such as property or money. However, many in the industry have been blinded by short termism and greed, unable to see the multi-trillion dollar value creation that will occur in the space. At Xalpha we aim to accelerate the creation of the next generation of blockchain protocols. As an investment fund in blockchain, our activities include: sourcing very early stage protocols with multi-billion dollar potential; developing quantitative & algorithmic trading strategies; and creating a blockchain ecosystem in Europe. Our day to day activity falls in to the 3 broad umbrellas of: -Eliminating and capitalising on market inefficiencies through quantitative strategies -Effectively allocating human & financial capital to the brightest entrepreneurs in world -Pioneering new standards & systems for market equity and transparency We are looking for a talented individual with demonstrable experience in programming to join us on this revolutionary journey in invigorating a new and people-empowering global society, catalysing only the most preeminent and absolute protocols in the world. ----------------------------------------------------------- Responsibilities ----------------------------------------------------------- -Participate in cutting edge research in artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. -Develop solutions for real world, large scale problems. ----------------------------------------------------------- Qualifications ----------------------------------------------------------- Minimum Qualifications: -1 to 2 years of work or educational programming experience. -Experience with one or more general purpose programming languages including but not limited to: Java, C/C++ or Python. Preferred qualifications: -BEng/MEng degree in Computer Science or related technical field or equivalent practical experience. -MS or PhD degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or related technical field. -Experience with one or more of the following: Natural Language Processing, text understanding, classification, pattern recognition, recommendation systems, targeting systems, ranking systems or similar. ----------------------------------------------------------- Our Values ----------------------------------------------------------- At Xalpha, we believe that maintaining strong values is key to building a healthy and sustainable work culture. Values shape our thoughts, words and actions and together they build an internal cohesion in the team that enable us to make the best decisions harmoniously. Trust We encourage an environment where trust is the backbone to every decision being made, owing to our firm belief that strong transparency within the team is crucial for any business\u2019 long-term success. Unsurprisingly built as the foundation of the Results Pyramid, trust makes you comfortable with being vulnerable to everyone\u2019s behaviours, strengths and weaknesses, cultivating only the best ideas at Xalpha. Radical open-mindedness Combined with trust, it is important to be radically open-minded and speak passionately about your own beliefs with founded conviction. We find that the act of scientifically challenging the opinions of others through thoughtful disagreements often converges to the most efficient solutions. \u201cIf x, do x^x\u201d In every project that we undertake, we make it the norm to be fully dedicated, whether we succeed or fail. if (effort >= x) {effort = x^x;} is our code of conduct where we encourage our team to go beyond their call of duty and more than exponentially grow towards our potential. Longstanding Integrity Dealing with money often can blind people and can lead them to take moral short-cuts. At Xalpha we believe that the greatest value will accrue in the long run. Having an impeccable reputation and being long term oriented will help us to be the most successful in the long run. \u201cIf you lose money for the firm I will be understanding. If you lose reputation I will be ruthless.\u201d - Warren Buffett Equal Employment Commitment We are committed to equal employment opportunity and consider applications from all wanting to join us in believing the potential of blockchain to shape the future.
