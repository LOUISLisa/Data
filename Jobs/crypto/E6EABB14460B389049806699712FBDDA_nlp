To be successful, you will bring expert knowledge of AWS, including an understanding of EC2, ELB, auto-scaling groups, server monitoring (Cloudwatch, etc.), etc. You will need to be skilled at understanding and discussing requirements from our frontend team. You will need to understand and use containers (where appropriate), understand microservice architecture and be able to implement this approach in a scalable way. You will understand how to properly manage and route client connections, use and create bash/sh scripts, and understand processes, daemons, services. You will need to know how to properly log server activities and use different ways to make use of git for effective development. As part of the interview process, we will ask you to provide a portfolio to showcase your past products. We are excited for you to show your accomplishments and will use this to facilitate the communication during the interview. What was your role in each of the items in your portfolio? What are you most proud of about each project in hindsight? What might you have done differently or, if you had opportunity, what might you add to each of these projects to improve them in the future?
