    "Body": " Welcome to Web 3.0 Our client is at the beginning of a new paradigm of engineering software. Software built on blockchain technology and particularly Smart Contracts in Ethereum is revolutionizing the types of applications that can be created. Along with this, is an entirely new way to develop software in this decentralized world. Our customer is moving forward into this exciting ecosystem to build a decentralized application (dApp) that take your personal data and put you in the control of not only who sees it, but ultimately pays you directly for allowing advertisers or companies to directly target you. They want to take the power away from the Google and Facebook\u2019s of the world and give it to the people themselves. To do this, they are seeking a Product Manager to assist in building software on the very cutting edge. The one fact that is ubiquitous in this new Ethereum frontier is that there is a total lack of usable applications. The ability for our client to make a difference with the features we bring to the masses are greatly enhanced if we make it in a way that is useable and a pleasure for people to interact with. This is where we need someone who wants to make a huge difference in usability and design. Primary Responsibilities Deliver state of the art software built around the Ethereum ecosystem Quickly learn brand new technologies, methodologies, and programming languages Be unstoppable at figuring out how to solve our problems. Remember, what we are building nobody has done before and few are even working in this technology. Much of the time, you will be the first person who needs to solve this problem Extensive Product Delivery experience and established success with going through the full product management life cycles & releases, and implementing emerging technologies into solutions Prior startup experience and successful roadmap where they experienced the up\u2019s and downs of a startup and provided the guidance to making it successful. Emphasis on experience in rolling out (or delivering) a product to a new industry vertical or market. Minimum Qualifications Must be located or willing to relocate to Austin, Texas on your own expense (PLEASE NOTE - This opportunity does not include a relocation package.) BS, MS or PhD in Computer Science, Engineering, Economics, Business, or Mathematics Expertise taking a SaaS based product and building an online commerce or advertisement platform or data marketplace/community around it where individuals can buy and sell their data.
