    "Body": " We are Aventus, a blockchain startup based in London dedicated to improving the ticketing industry as a whole by creating a standard for rules-based tickets on the Ethereum blockchain. Since September last year we\u2019ve raised 60K ETH (around $20m USD at the time) in a token sale, and we\u2019re now scaling our team to create real, tangible products that deliver true business and consumer benefits. We already have clients and expect to have over 100,000 people owning Ethereum wallets without knowing it by Q3! As part of the blockchain team, you will have the opportunity to experiment with various areas of blockchain development, including: solidity, EVM optimisation, scaling solution development, and cryptoeconomic design. No previous blockchain experience is required, but it is a definite plus - we are looking for good engineers with proper experience and knowledge of best practises. We have a competitive package, which includes: private health insurance, equity, AVT incentives, and salary. We are a friendly team and regularly have offsite events and excursions, and we have dart tournaments on Fridays! Interested? Email [email????????????protected] with your CV and a note! Skills Standard software engineering practises Compensation Very competitive + Equity ",
