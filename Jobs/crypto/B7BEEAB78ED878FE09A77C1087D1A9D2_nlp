    "Body": " I'm looking to hire a C# developer for my boutique algorithmic trading firm. We've been running market neutral strategies since 2014 in traditional financial markets (futures, equity derivatives, etc.), and in mid-2017 began modifying our platform, building out the connectivity, and deploying our strategies in crypto markets. In addition to our core trading application, we have a 'connectivity hub' - a separate C# application which is used to connect our infrastructure with roughly 20 exchanges. Aside for adding additional exchanges, the developer will be responsible for designing and implementing (and then maintaining) several new components for the connectivity hub. This is a unique opportunity for a motivated developer to make a major contribution and have significant influence on the direction of our projects. We have developed a suite of applications that continue to be used in production; however, the developers have thus far worked remotely and I'm now consolidating the team to work on-location in New York for a few different reasons. Subsequently, the position will be akin to joining a start-up in the amount of responsibility and influence that you will have, and potential 'upside' of joining a growing company at an early stage. On the other hand, we are well capitalized, and have been operating profitably for last 5+ years, including through the bull market in crypto of 2018 - so you don't have the 'job security' risk, and funding issues, typically associated with startups. Experience in trading and crypto are not required, but definitely valuable. Skills C# .Net (C++, added benefit) Compensation 50-80k per year + bonus (Also negotiable for developers with considerable experience with trading applications) Applications for this job are currently closed.
