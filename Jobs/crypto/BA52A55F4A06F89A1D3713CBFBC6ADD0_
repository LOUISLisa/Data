    "Body": " Status Status is building powerful decentralized apps on Ethereum that change the way we do things on the web. Our rapidly growing team is made up of self-motivated individuals who prosper in a fast-paced environment and value the ability to work from anywhere. As a product, Status is an open source discovery tool for the Ethereum blockchain that makes it easy for anyone to access apps and services built on the decentralized web. Status also allows users to browse, chat, make payments and more. Opportunity Open Bounty is one of Status\u2019 flagship products that aims to foster the movement for open source software. Open source software is a multi-billion dollar industry but historically has lacked the right incentive structures to reward developers for their efforts. Using blockchain technology and the power of smart contracts on Ethereum, Status Open Bounty enables developers to be rewarded in cryptocurrency for code contributions, and organisations to post bounties and find talented new team members. We are looking for an Account Manager to help put in place structures, processes and ideas to support the organizations utilizing Open Bounty. Job role Your main duties include building strong relationships with key contacts in organizations using the Open Bounty platform, support their day to day operation in management of their bounties, and putting in place a feedback loop so the community can be directly engaged in the ongoing development of the platform. Responsibilities Maintain regular and open communication with accounts and organizations using the platform. Be the point of contact for support/feedback. Management of active bounties through their lifecycle (follow up on stale bounties, unfunded bounties, PRs that require review/feedback). Produce regular reports for Organizations on their performance. Requirements 3 years account management experience. Ability to multi-task across multiple threads involving numerous stakeholders and counterparties. Technically savvy enabling you to easily interact with software developers and architects. Some experience with GitHub and open source projects. Interest in blockchain technology and willingness to learn. Excellent written and verbal English and communication skills. Flexibility and availability to work across multiple time-zones. Self-motivated and the ability to work with a high degree of autonomy. Working at Status We're a remote team of made up of 70 people scattered around the globe. Everyone at Status works from a location of their choosing - and we all meet up twice a year to strategize and strengthen our relationships. We care deeply about open source software, and our organizational structure does away with strict hierarchy and fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the team's priorities.
