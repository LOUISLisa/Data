    "Body": " Clearmatics is an established blockchain R&D company in London, UK. We have good ties to the Open Source / Ethereum community, our Lead Engineer works closely with the Ethereum Foundation, and the company is an EEA Member. We\u2019re funded and have revenue, so we won\u2019t be doing any ICOs. We\u2019re looking to hire multiple senior engineers to expand our team. Our stack is Ethereum-like so familiarity and passion with the space is key. Some of the areas we tackle include scalability through cryptography (zkSNARKs, multiparty computation, private transactions/assets), protocol design (e.g. proof relays/pegs), formally verified smart contracts, type-safe & performant distributed virtual machines. About you We are looking for people who are not afraid of unknowns and enjoy working with others to problem solve and break new ground. You should have more than a passing interest in the Ethereum or cryptocurrency space, with contributions to Open Source Projects being a distinct plus. You should be able to reason about technical problems, argue thoughtfully and contribute in a team setting. If you want rock star or ninja in your job title then this isn\u2019t the right job for you. We have a lot of hard problems to solve. If you\u2019d like to make significant contributions to the blockchain ecosystem and think you are a match then we\u2019d like to hear from you. Requirements \u2022 Good grasp of Computer Science fundamentals (data structures, algorith- mic complexity, etc) \u2022 Experience in strongly typed languages (C/C++, Golang, Scala, Rust) \u2022 Demonstrable interest in Ethereum / the cryptocurrency space \u2022 Comfortable working in a new field \u2022 Experience with network and concurrent programming \u2022 Willingness to work on research projects and brainstorm solutions with team \u2022 5+ years experience as a software engineer Nice to have \u2022 Practical understanding of cryptography and theoretical information security \u2022 Golang experience \u2022 Involved in the cryptocurrency community \u2022 Contributions to open source projects in the space (dapps/geth/etc) Skills Go, Python, Ethereum Compensation ",
