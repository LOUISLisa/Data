    "Body": " About Argent Crypto has the potential to create a fairer internet and more open financial system. We want to make that accessible to everyone. To do this, we\u2019ve built a crypto wallet with the simplicity and security of the best new banking apps - without the bank. We hope it solves some of crypto\u2019s biggest problems: there are no seed phrases, transaction fees or cryptic addresses. And it protects you from theft. As a team, we have experience scaling mobile apps to tens of millions of users. Our eclectic backgrounds include PhDs in nuclear physics, quantum cryptography and decentralised cognitive networks. We\u2019re fortunate to be backed by the top VCs in Europe, including Index Ventures, Creandum and firstminute capital. The Senior Android Engineer role The Senior Android Engineer drives the development of our native Android app. You\u2019ll be particularly critical to Argent\u2019s future as Android is the dominant platform in emerging markets, where there are some of the most urgent use cases for crypto. You\u2019ll therefore be solving problems at scale for people around the world. This means we\u2019re looking for a highly skilled Android developer who can push mobile technologies to their limits. Your code will be efficient, maintainable, reusable and well-tested. You\u2019ll define and build state-of-the-art application architecture. And you\u2019ll implement custom native user interfaces using the latest Android programming techniques. In the role you\u2019ll work closely with world class engineers and product designers who aim to build an unrivalled product. You\u2019ll not only contribute technical ideas but will help shape their overall direction. Requirements are: - 3+ years experience delivering quality, at scale consumer-facing Android apps available in the Play Store - Fluency with Java and RxJava; knowledge of Kotlin is a plus - Interest in blockchain and the Ethereum ecosystem - Strong object-oriented programming, and a good knowledge of pattern and anti-pattern design - Experience with app profiling, code versioning, deployment and continuous integration - Strong communication skills and an ability to work with both engineers and other roles - Fluency in written and spoken english How we work We work remotely, transparently and balance Argent with the rest of our lives. We\u2019ve all got loved ones with unpredictable schedules, be they kids or cats. Although we\u2019re a distributed team you'll need to be based in the UK or Europe. This is because we find communication much easier when we\u2019re in similar time zones and a short flight away. Within Europe you can choose to work wherever you like! We get together for a week every quarter so we can collaborate in person, explore new solutions, and have fun. So far we\u2019ve played p????????????tanque in Nice, bonded in Brussels and (tried to) surf in Lisbon. Equal opportunities At the heart of what we do is making crypto accessible to everyone. We want the team itself to reflect that diversity so we\u2019d strongly encourage applications from underrepresented demographics. No agencies please Skills Java, Android, Play Store, RxJava Compensation 6500 + Equity ",
