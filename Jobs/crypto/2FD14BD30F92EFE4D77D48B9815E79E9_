    "Body": " Our team is ready to offer and implement projects related to BlockChain, Corda R3, Hyperledger Fabric, MultiChain, ICO, Cryptocurrency, Exchange, exchangers and a number of other technologies. Below we will try to briefly outline our capabilities that will help you solve your problems for successful business and processes. Our team can create private BlockChain for solving any specialized tasks that require high data processing speed, not at the expense of reliability and security. At the moment, our specialists can build a network that will process more than 5000 transactions per second. This is many time higher than the public blockchain Bitcoin and Ethereum. At the same time, a consensus algorithm similar to Raft is used. The development uses such programming languages as Rust - which occupies the same niche as C ++ but is more reliable and faster, due to zero-cost abstractions. Programs written with it load all the cores of the processor, parallelize the problems in order to solve them several times faster than programs in C and C ++ do, and also the languages and technologies of Java and Python are closely used. We do not reinvent the wheel every time from scratch, but we use the advanced Exonum Framework. This is the OpenSource framework for the development of powerful private BlockChain from the Bitfury Group. Thanks to this, we have a high speed of development and productivity. Corda R3 - We are well acquainted with the distributed accounting system Corda offered by the R3 Group. The code for it is written by our team in Java and Kotlin. The consortium R3 includes the largest IT corporations and banks, such as Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan & Co., Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Mitsubishi ,UFJ Financial Group, Morgan Stanley, National Australia Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, UniCredit, BNP Paribas, IBM, Intel and others. https://www.r3.com Hyperledger Fabric - Our team is fully ready to solve the problems that need to be solved on Hyperledger, this technology solution is actively promoted by such large companies as Linux Foundation, Cisco, Fujitsu, Hitachi, IBM, Intel, Deutsche B????????????rse Group, J.P. Morgan, State Street, SWIFT, Wells Fargo, and others. Exchange, market and receipt of payments - We can deploy and configure the node on the server. Provide automated acceptance of payments from customers with a transfer to a cold wallet or any other distribution. At the moment the team actively works with such currencies: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple. Easily expand this list, if necessary. Ethereum - On the Ethereum platform, our team owns the fullest range of technologies. We write the SmartContract in the language of Solidity. For this, we use IDE Remix and Intelij Idea and a number of other technological solutions. In the development, we use the most advanced implementation standards from Zeppelin. We write a SmartContract for the ICO. Tokens with any properties conforming to the ERC20 standard for exchange. For SmartContract management, we create convenient dashboards in Java / Python / PHP, which interact with the blockchains and smart contracts. At the same time, we can offer solutions on pure JS or Angular that interact with BlockChain via Web3 and MetaMask. Design and architecture - Our team can develop unique architectural solutions for non-trivial tasks. Such as: Voting and electronic elections on the blockchains Arbitration on the blockchain Litigation by independent arbitrators like the Augur system. Management of tenure rights. It can be used both for copyrights of works of art and for property rights. Electronic auctions of all types (open, closed, tenders, etc.) Monitoring of the production chain. Track the origin of raw materials and products. Integration with the Internet of things (IoT + Blockchain). Verification and identification of users with the blockchain. Creation of own cryptocurrency. and a huge number of directions and technological solutions of the thematic area. MultiChain - We develop complex systems that consist of many heterogeneous blockchains that exchange information while being protected from forgery. ICO - Full development of platforms for ICO, the development process includes: Design and projection Development and thinking of logic and architecture Writing a platform Writing a SmartContract Assistance in publishing a project in the publication Technical support and maintenance of ICO Our team of developers is happy to answer all your questions and realize the tasks of any complexity and architecture, bringing your project to a new level! Skills PHP, Java, C++ Compensation 2000 ",
