    "Body": " BitPay is seeking a Senior Front End Developer to help build the future of commerce and bring blockchain payments technology to the world. Most products in fintech look very similar because they are all built on the same legacy payment rails underneath (credit cards, ACH, etc). However, digital currency turns this idea on its head, providing a blank canvas to design a new payment system from the ground up.

In this role, you will apply your passion for tackling complex UI problems with a focus on our customers' needs.

Develop \u2014 Translate complexity into user-friendly experiences by using state-of-the-art front end technologies and CSS. Test \u2014 Set up A/B testing in collaboration with the design team to figure out the best user flows. Iterate \u2014 Leverage feedback and data to iterate on the designs.

Diverse portfolio of work with strong examples of web-based applications (examples of your best work \u2013 pixel-perfect UI, live product links, UI animations, and code are all enthusiastically accepted) Cryptocurrency development experience is a plus You are a passionate champion for bringing beautiful looking UIs to life, but also love an environment where creativity and a make-things-happen attitude is rewarded.
