    "Body": " Product Management at Kyber Network is about finding the simplest means to an end, even if that requires changing the rules of the game. It is not merely about writing down requirements from business stakeholders or synchronising between different products. A great Product Manager articulates the specific scope of a product that we offer at Kyber to a wide variety of audiences, including why a product is important and how it should be delivered. It is about developing products by identifying potential products; conducting market research; generating product requirements; determining specifications, production timetables, pricing, and time-integrated plans for product introduction; and developing marketing strategies.
