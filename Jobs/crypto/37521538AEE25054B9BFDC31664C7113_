    "Body": " CoinFi is a fast-moving cryptocurrency media and software startup looking for a motivated, driven and resourceful Product Manager to join our team in Hong Kong. Our Story When CoinFi cofounder Tim quit his job as a hedge fund manager to trade cryptocurrency full-time, he realized there was a lack of institutional caliber research and trading tools like he was accustomed to on Wall Street. Together with his fellow cofounders Han and Nate, Tim realized there was a big gap in the market that we could solve with a new type of crypto market intelligence platform. We quickly got to work and in Aug 2017 launched a token sale. This culminated in Jan 2018 when we raised $15M USD to grow our cryptocurrency media and software startup. Thanks to the token sale, we already have a subscriber list of 80,000+ readers and a telegram community of 23,000+ crypto investors. While it\u2019s still early, we\u2019re on our way to becoming the leading provider of trading intelligence for the cryptocurrency markets. What\u2019s the opportunity? We\u2019re building a market intelligence platform, and we cannot succeed without having world-class talent who can help us identify, refine, communicate, and prioritize our product vision. As a Product Owner at CoinFi, you\u2019ll be supported by colleagues who not only have subject matter expertise in cryptocurrencies and trading, but who appreciate the value that Product Management brings to a product organization. You\u2019ll work closely with the cofounders to come up with the best product vision for CoinFi. Get in on the ground floor of an ambitious startup - we\u2019re on a mission to be the go-to resource in every crypto trader\u2019s workflow. By combining currently disparate toolchains into one unified platform, we\u2019ll be able to take advantage of the synergies between each product and deliver much more value to users than individual standalone solutions can at the moment. We have a serious war chest and a team with the right experience to execute on this vision. You\u2019d be one of the first pioneers to join us post token sale. Your mission (should you choose to accept) as Product Manager at CoinFi is to own the product and deliver business value to users efficiently with our available resources. We recognize the immense value a Product Manager brings to the team, and you\u2019ll quickly become the rock star of the organization as you help us identify, refine, communicate, prioritize, and execute our product vision. What\u2019s it like working with us? We\u2019re a fast moving startup, not a lifestyle business. We have capital and a big mission, we\u2019re looking for top performers to join us as we step on the gas and get things done efficiently. We believe the cryptocurrency industry is similar to equities in the 90\u2019s at the start of a multi-year bull run, with many money making trading strategies due to market inefficiencies. There is a huge opportunity for early movers to capture market share. Growing this business is something we think about around the clock, and in this position it should be something you think about a lot as well. We\u2019re committed to working as a team to create a truly exceptional product. At the same time, we do believe in being productive, not busy. Team members aren\u2019t expected to come into the office on weekends, and you'll get 4 weeks of vacation time in addition to the generous public Hong Kong holidays to prevent burnout. We are located in WeWork, a dynamic co-working space, and you\u2019ll have the freedom to work in multiple hot desks in the building as well as your own dedicated desk with a 27\" monitor. There\u2019s the obligatory free unlimited coffee/tea and beer as well as ping pong table. We value continuous learning, self improvement and self-reflection. We like to share ideas and engage in healthy debate - there are no sacred cows - we approach new ideas with an open mind and evaluate them from first principles. If you\u2019re looking to stop thinking about work by 5PM everyday, this role isn\u2019t for you. But if you\u2019re passionate about building product that customers love, learning new things, have an interest in cryptocurrencies, and want to help build something with real impact in an exciting growth industry with a team of easy-going, but high-performing people - then you\u2019ll fit right in! What will you be doing? You\u2019ll be working closely with the co-founders to discover the best product to deliver at the right time based on market needs/wants, available resources, and cost:effort ratio. Maintain a deep understanding of customer avatars. Research the competition, identify opportunities, generate new ideas to grow market share. Constantly refine, shepherd, and communicate the product vision to team members, ensuring that everyone is aligned towards to same goals. Translate product strategy and vision into detailed requirements, building the plan to execute on the vision. Work closely with design and engineering to explain requirements (along with underlying business rationale), understand implementation tradeoffs, and prioritizing appropriately to obtain maximal results with finite resources. Help drive product launches with PR / marketing team to ensure widespread distribution. Keep tabs on user engagement/adoption data to help make decisions, iterate to improve on customer experience. Question assumptions, think outside of the box for creative solutions when warranted. Always look for leverage, especially by applying the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) to get disproportionate results for the effort required. This position is for you if you: Want to deeply understand all aspects of the business since they constitute inter-related parts including financial, marketing, legal, technical, and user experience in order to determine solutions that work for the customer as well as the business. You should derive excitement from taking responsibility for ensuring a business outcome. Possess a strong product sense by understanding the various crypto user avatars (ideally by personally being at least one of them) and always acting in the best interest of those avatars, often in the face of pressure. This means sacrificing your ego in the service of finding the best solution, which includes always listening to the market to find out what they really value and simplifying the feature set down to the things that will positively impact users. Follow the cryptocurrency markets and personally own cryptocurrency, with at least one account on a crypto exchange. Ideally you trade occasionally and/or have participated in at least one ICO as well. Have a baseline technical background alongside familiarity with the product development lifecycle. Basically, you should be comfortable with project management toolchains and know enough to evaluate design and engineering teams on both time/effort estimates as well as concerns they may raise such as technical debt, and question those estimates or concerns when warranted. Understand online marketing and user psychology at a deep level to predict reactions and bake growth into the product. Enjoy collaborating with smart, driven colleagues to solve real problems for users. Leverage exceptional communication skills in both written and verbal English to explain and persuade, especially with regards to displaying empathy for users and team members. Have read and passionately resonate with this blog post: https://svpg.com/behind-every-great-product/ Compensation We are willing to pay above market rates for a superstar candidate, especially one who has a proven track record of success in a product role, ideally in a similar industry. If you\u2019re that candidate, please include your salary expectations along with your application. If you\u2019re currently based outside of Hong Kong, we\u2019re also willing to provide a full relocation package to Hong Kong with plenty of benefits.
