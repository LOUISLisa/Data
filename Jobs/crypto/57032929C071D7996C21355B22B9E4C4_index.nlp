    "Body": " Help us grow the BitGuild community and get rewarded for it! Introducing: GuildKeeper Program 2.0 ???????????????????????? Like most of you know by now, Guildchat 2.0 is almost ready to be launched. That\u2019s something that we don\u2019t want to do alone, and who else could better help us than our own community? Together we can make Guildchat 2.0 the best crypto app in the space. For that reason, we\u2019re looking for a complete new group of GuildKeepers. The GuildKeepers program was successfully launched earlier as a way to create a partnership program between us and some of our community pillars. This comes as a natural progression of our goal to spread our message as far and wide as humanly possible, which will ensure a constant flow of new users to BitGuild and related products/services. GuildKeepers are crypto enthusiasts selected by BitGuild to represent the company and its vision within the app and on social media. As ambassadors, they are the link between the community and the BitGuild team \u2014 which means they have a seat at the table where they can share their feedback and suggestions. GuildKeepers are an example for the GuildChat community, moderating the channels and inspiring others to join.
