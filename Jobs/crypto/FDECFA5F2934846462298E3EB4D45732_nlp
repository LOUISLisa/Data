    "Body": " iOlite is an open-source, blockchain and machine learning platform, that allows anyone to write smart contracts, using any language, natural or programming. The platform is developed with the purpose of bringing more mainstream users, commercial and non-commercial, to start using blockchain technology. iOlite tokens will be used to compensate contributors in the iOlite network that help with the machine-learning process: each text parsing suggestion that is accepted by the iOlite Fast Adaptation Engine (FAE), will be compensated with iLT tokens. In addition, authors will be able to share their smart contracts with other iOlite ecosystem members, for fees in iLT tokens. We are conducting an invite-only Proof of Care campaign for knowledgable blockchain enthusiasts that radiate a level of passion that inspires others to action. What does the job entail? If you need micromanaged, this isn't the role for you. The deliverables expected from you: - Develop proposals for personal projects to further iOlite's visibility and subsequent presale/TGE contributions - This can be approaching a niche crypto/blockchain community (speak a language that can open us to a new demographic? That's a huge perk!) and spreading the word about iOlite - Generating quality media content (videos, articles, infographics) - Approaching influencers and arranging discussions with our Operations Manager (similar to a Sales Development Representative) - Anything that you can quantifiably demonstrate will better the iOlite Foundation is on the table. In your application, include your resume, your favorite GIF, and three ideas you'd propose as your first tasks in this role.
