    "Body": " About Venoty Venoty introduces in the online environment through blockchain technology the first platform of personal development of children throught creativity. We consider education as the decisive factor acting on the child. Venoty Coin is a digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world and use peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority. Venoty was launched using the Scrypt algorithm which we have assessed to be the most suitable algorithm currently available that aligns with our goals. -Egalitarian proof of work -Anonymous payments -Wallet encryption -Faster transaction speed -Scalability -Efficiency in mining Scrypt allows almost anyone with a CPU/GPU the ability to mine Venoty, the algorithm is ASIC resistant and is using Dark Gravity Wave . Dark Gravity Wave (DGW) is an open source difficulty-adjusting algorithm for Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies. Evan Duffield authored DGW as a response to a time-warp exploit found in Kimoto\u2019s Gravity Well. DGW is similar to Kimoto Gravity Well, adjusting the difficulty levels every block (instead of every 2016 blocks like Bitcoin) by using statistical data of the last blocks found. This allows block issuing times to remain consistent despite high fluctuations in hashpower, however, it doesn\u2019t suffer from the time-warp exploit. Description Venoty is recruiting a Japanese Community Manager (Part-time) to manage and expand the Venoty community.
