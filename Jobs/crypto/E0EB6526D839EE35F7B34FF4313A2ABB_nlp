We are a small team so you will need to be able to jump into a dynamic environment to learn and contribute. Our product is a downloadable wallet integrated with exchanges (including a decentralized exchange of our own) that tracks the value of the portfolio of tokens in the wallet and enables users to trade tokens with confidence. For a user that actively holds, tracks and trades crypto tokens, particularly the multitude that support the ERC-20 standard it is cumbersome, confusing and downright scary. The products that are available to support these users are fragmented, insecure, poorly designed and don\u2019t provide a comforting or guided experience to the user. This is particularly important the in the blockchain world which operates in a complex and quickly evolving technical world. Our product brings together key user needs with a UX that inspires confidence and makes the process easy and efficient. If you're interested in the crypto economy, this is a great opportunity to build credibility quickly. Your designs will be turned into shipping product quickly.
