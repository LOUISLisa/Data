    "Body": " Why BitClaims.io? The BitClaims.io platform is making history by building a decentralized healthcare ecosystem designed to minimize the role of intermediaries in healthcare services and return lost value to patients and providers. The healthcare today is designed in favor of the middlemen who extract fees from services that should be commoditized. By creating an open blockchain network that can directly connect patients and providers via smart contracts on blockchain, BitClaims increases patient health savings and grows provider revenue, while driving down the cost of care. BitClaims is supported and funded by Ark.io. We are on target to launch ICO in a couple of months.
