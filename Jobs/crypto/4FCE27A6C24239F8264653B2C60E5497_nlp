    "Body": " The Atomz Project is here to simplify investing in cryptocurrencies. The ATOMZ project aims to make investing easy while generating profit for customers. Our software will analyze a multitude of trends pertaining to cryptocurrency. After many calculations and comparisons, our software will rate the cryptocurrencies with an ATOMZ index. This index will determine the best cryptocurrency to buy and sell at that moment. With the ATOMZ Platform, we aim to help first time and regular investors in cryptocurrencies to overcome the hurdle of investing in blockchain technology. Problem: With the emergence of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies associated with it, more people are considering an investment in crypto. However, many find it difficult, confusing and time-consuming to know which cryptocurrencies to buy and sell. Many people fall victim to the hype surrounding cryptocurrency. There is always somebody captured by FOMO (fear of missing out), buying massively in at the peak of a bubble, just in hope to make quick money, while not understanding cryptocurrencies, due to lack of professional and researched advice. In addition, newcomers do not know how, when and where to purchase cryptocurrencies, creating a barrier to the cryptocurrency market. Many people also lack the knowledge and awareness to diversify their personal portfolio to reduce risk, similar to mutual funds in the stock market. There aren\u2019t known services for these needs. For investors who do not have the time to constantly trade their assets and wish to do so, a cheap, reliable, trustworthy transparent and automatic system is needed. Solution: The solution is an all in one platform offering cryptocurrency advice when trying to purchase or sell, crypto packs similar to mutual funds, and a trading bot to regularly buy and sell cryptocurrency that the platform believes will surge in price. To accomplish this, the ATOMZ Platform is utilizing many trends, trading strategies and formulas to come up with the ATOMZ Index, a number ranging from 0 to 100, low meaning buy and high meaning sell. The platform will be customizable to the users liking and help the average person invest in cryptocurrencies. Token: The Atomz Token, the symbol being ATZ, itself will be an ERC20 basic token, without the possibility for additional minted tokens. There will be a total of 25,000,000 ATZ Tokens. This token will have a few utilities: ensuring a new way to log in and access the dashboard, purchasing services, assuring trust and transparency, improving the algorithm, utilizing the community decentralized voting system. We assume that the value of the token should inevitably go up since the supply is limited and is small compared to others.
