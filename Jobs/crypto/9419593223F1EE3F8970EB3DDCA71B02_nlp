Or just some of them, because it's not all about you having loads of experience, all you need are the skills, the knowledge and the self-belief that you can do what you say you can...we do check. The slave trade is not something we believe in, but we do want the people involved to have a vested interest. These are rolls that can, within reason, be completed on a basis to suit you. Initially, payments will be via ongoing equity with completion bonuses. Please bear this in mind before sending us your details. We love living far out, so give us your best shot.
