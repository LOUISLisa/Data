More and more companies are beginning to recognize the benefits of paying team members in cryptocurrency, but traditional accounting apps just don't offer the tools needed for blockchain accounting. Nor do they offer the same benefits that a truly blockchain-based solution can provide. Our MVP is already live at https://gilded.finance, and we're hard at work on premium features that will be available only to paying customers. We're in need of a highly skilled content marketing to develop an effective content strategy, establish our SEO authority, drive inbound leads, and convert leads to customers. We need a passionate, skilled digital marketer to lead projects like: -Designing inbound marketing funnels -Creating landing pages for our key customer personas -Writing copy for lead magnets, emails, and more -Creating and implementing drip email campaigns -Recruiting and managing writers for specific blog posts and other writing projects -Using paid promotion strategically to drive traffic -Building up Twitter, Medium, and LinkedIn social media followers We need someone who can truly lead our digital marketing campaigns, being proactive about finding new avenues for growth and leveraging time wisely by utilizing outsourced teams when advantageous. You must be available for a minimum of 10 hrs/week currently, with the hours likely to ramp up significantly once our initial funding round closes in the next couple weeks. Ideally, we're looking for someone interested in becoming a partner/co-founder on the project as it grows.
