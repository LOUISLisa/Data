It is important that you have a good knowledge of the ICO space and will be able to apply critical analysis to the business models of projects in addition to identifying other projects working in the same space. Working environment: We are a distributed team and communicate primarily with Telegram and email while using Google Docs for collaborative working.

This should be limited to the token economics only (no need to mention team, concept, etc). Only applications that include this evaluation will be considered.
