While she did not elaborate on what projects the researchers may be working on, she did note that the company currently works withÂ CrÃ©dit Mutuel, Orange Bank, Generali, France's national railway system andÂ MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (LVMH).During the interview, she said: \"In the next two years, we will hire 1,800 people in France at IBM. In January, we announced a project to recruit 400 people for research. These jobs will include AI, blockchain ... and the Internet of Things.\" The move is just the latest in IBM's push to expand its blockchain research. Last week atÂ CoinDesk's Consensus 2018Â conference, the company announced it was partnering with environmental technology startup Veridium Labs to create a carbon credit token on the Stellar network. Stepping back, the company has recently announced efforts to tackleÂ advertising,Â humanitarian aid,Â business registriesÂ and evenÂ insurance, as previously reported by CoinDesk.
