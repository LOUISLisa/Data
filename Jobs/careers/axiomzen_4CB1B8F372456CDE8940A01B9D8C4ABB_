Zen Workspace Dog-friendly, welcoming of children, and crafted for comfort \u2013 our workspace is constantly improving to help our Axioms reach the most creative and productive version of themselves. Staying together Once a week we sit down to eat together. The team lunch is one of our many traditions that help us to tighten the bonds between Axioms that work on unrelated projects. Hear from the team Jialin Wu Director of Accounting, Axiom Zen I love the opportunities and challenges of working with Blockchain and Software as a Service (SaaS) businesses, and helping to build the future of the portfolio. Mack Flavelle Chief Creative Officer, Dapper Labs To succeed at Axiom Zen, you must have a ferocious desire to shape the future, the arrogance to believe you can, and the humility to know you'll need help. Dieter Shirley CTO, Dapper Labs I\u2019ve never worked with a team that is so relentlessly focussed on possibilities. We don\u2019t whinge about our problems, we work through the challenges keeping us from realizing our visions. Our advisors Interview Process 1 Apply We\u2019ll start by reviewing your resume. We\u2019re curious about you, so be sure to include information that showcases your skills and interests, such as your LinkedIn or GitHub profile, portfolio, or website. 2 Chat with us We\u2019ll email you to schedule a meeting. Tell us what you\u2019re passionate about, your accomplishments, and the kind of challenges you\u2019re looking for. If there's a fit, you'll be scheduled for a chat with a hiring manager. We want to know the depth of your knowledge as it relates to the role. 3 Show us what you got We may ask to see samples of your work. Depending on the position you\u2019re applying for, these can be writing, code, or design samples. There might also be a take home assignment to help us understand if we\u2019re a match. 4 Meet the team Collaboration, feedback, and discussion are key to all positions at Axiom Zen. As such, we may invite you for an elbow-to-elbow session with other team members to see if we all work well together. After interviewing with a few Axioms (and likely our founder as well), we\u2019ll review everyone\u2019s feedback before requesting references. Depending on the role, we may invite you for multiple interviews to make sure we\u2019re a fit. 5 References and offer We want to hear from people who\u2019ve worked with you. Ideally, that feedback comes from previous supervisors or managers. Once we\u2019re confident we have a fit, we\u2019ll send out an official job offer! Timing Building agile teams who thrive in a distributed hierarchy is complicated alchemy. We pride ourselves on finding perfect fits, so our collaborative hiring process is comprehensive. Be sure to let us know of any deadlines, and we\u2019ll do our best to accommodate you.
