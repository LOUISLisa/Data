Before using any of the Bernstein services, you are required to read, understand, and agree to these terms. The column on the right provides a short explanation of the terms of use and is not legally binding. Â  Description of the Service Bernstein Technologies GmbH (\u201cBernstein\u201d or \u201cWe\u201d) provides a platform via its website bernstein.io (the \u201cSite\u201d) to a community of registered users (\u201cUsers\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d) to upload files and submit texts. User information are organized in coherent sets of data called innovation units (\u201cUnits\u201d), each representing a specific intellectual property asset. You are solely responsible for creating and maintaining your Units.Â  Bernstein provides you with tools to securely encrypt, store, retrieve and share Units. Encrypted Units are stored on Bernstein servers. Decrypted Units are never sent or stored on Bernstein servers. Â  For each Unit Bernstein allows users to generate digital certificates by: 1) registering a Unit on the blockchain, a secure distributed ledger; 2) submitting a Unit to a trusted European Union Timestamping Authority. In both cases the content of the Unit is not revealed to any third party since only a cryptographic fingerprint of the Unit is required to produce the certificates. All above mentioned features and new ones that may be added are collectively indicated as \u201cthe Service\u201d. You understand and agree that the Service is provided \u201cas-is\u201d and that Bernstein assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user data or personalization settings. Â  Basically,Â  Bernstein online tool for managing and protecting your intellectual property. We will develop more features and services in the future.
