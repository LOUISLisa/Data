Gino Sorcinelli 23 hr 1 Sign up to like post Subscribe LoginPrivacyTerms Share Singing played a constant role in the lives Columbus, Ohio natives Nannie \u201cPenny\u201d Sharpe and her brothers Donald, John, and William \u201cPreston\u201d Coulter. Now known to the world as Penny & The Quarters, the four siblings always found a way to make music together, no matter what the occasion. \u201cWe\u2019d sing all the time, in church, in the house,\u201d SharpeÂ told Sean Michaels in a 2011 Guardian interview. \u201cWe\u2019d stand around, helping whoever\u2019s turn it was to wash dishes that week, singing together.\u201d After hearing that the Columbus record label Prix needed regional talent in 1969, they decided to take their love of music to the next level. The ensuing trip to Prix\u2019s Harmonic Sounds studio landed Penny, Donald, John, and William a gig doing backup vocal work, leading to long days at filled with endless takes. Sharpe, who was only 19 at the time, didn\u2019t always love the process. \u201cWe would go over there every Saturday morning and stay all day, from 7am to 4pm,\u201d SharpeÂ told The Guardian. \u201cI remember thinking: \u2018Do we have to stay all day?\u2019\u201d An early photo of Nannie \u201cPenny\u201d Sharpe. (Photo Credit:Â Numero Group) Once she honed her skills as a backup singer, Sharpe wanted a chance for her family to take center stage and eventually worked up the courage to ask Harmonic songwriter Jay Robinson to work with them. \u201cI remember he used to emphasize to us to enunciate those words, and he liked the phrase \u2018my, my, my, my\u2019 to illustrate,\u201d SharpeÂ told The Guardian. After the group felt Robinson had appropriately polished their sound they hit the studio, with the Harmonic songwriter penning an original titled \u201cYou and Me\u201d for their session.Â The fateful recording of their now-famous song was a one-take demo where listeners can hear Sharpe utilizing the \u201cmy, my, my, my\u201d mentioned above several times. Though the lone recording of the song is strikingly beautiful, Sharpe\u2019s brother Preston later said the group was unaware someone was recording them as they performed it. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize they were recording,\u201d heÂ toldÂ Eric Lyttle in a 2011Â feature for The Other Paper, a now defunct Columbus alternative weekly that broke the story about the song\u2019s origins. \u201cWe were just trying to get ourselves on record.\" For Penny & The Quarters, the recording session at Harmonic Sounds was their one and only\u2014changing consumer tastes and a lack of funds led to the studio\u2019s eventual demise. After Sharpe\u2019s brief stint as a backup vocalist, she workedÂ as a mail sorterÂ for 30 years before retiring. The group\u2019s demo reel went into storage and remained untouched for the next 35 years. Then, according to theÂ Eccentric Soul: The Prix LabelÂ liner notes, Columbus record collector Blake Oliver was checking local yard sales for hidden gems in 2005\u2014a regular Saturday morning ritual for him. During his travels he stumbled upon an estate sale and picked up a box of tapes that caught his eye. The tapes eventually made their way to Numero Group owner Rob Sevier and renowned Ohio soul expert Dante Carfagna. After giving them a listen, Carfagna and Sevier realized they were demos and unreleased recording from Harmonic Sounds. The Numero Group fell in love with \u201cYou and Me\u201d right away, but couldn\u2019t figure out who the performers were. Though they talked to anyone and everyone they could find who knew about the Columbus scene, \u201cincluding retired DJs, producers, and important local artists,\u201d nobody could tell them anything about Penny & The Quarters. Despite their lack of knowledge regarding the song, The Numero Group put it on theirÂ Eccentric Soul: The Prix LabelÂ compilation. TheyÂ admittedÂ to neglecting it a bit at first, as \u201cit may\u2019ve ended up a bit buried on our original compilation, as #18 of 19 tracks.\u201d The story of Penny & The Quarters then took another surprising turn when Ryan Gosling visited his PR agent two years after the release ofÂ Eccentric Soul: The Prix Label. During the visit, his agent played him some songs from the compilation and Gosling was immediately struck by \u201cYou & Me.\u201dÂ A short time later he approachedÂ Blue ValentineÂ director Derek Cianfrance about using the song in the film, giving the unreleased demo cut from Ohio yet another act in its ever-evolving story.

(Photo Credit:Â Numero Group) As \u201cYou & Me\u201d made it\u2019s way from forgotten demo to soul compilation to Ryan Gosling movie in the span of 5 years, Penny & The Quarters were unaware of the song\u2019s resurgence. According toÂ The Other Paper, that changed when Sharpe\u2019s daughter Jayma was having dinner with a friends and one of them brought up the recording and the mystery surrounding the unknown artists responsible for it. After she did some cursory internet research, Jayma realized that the singer was her mother\u2014resulting in a string of happily frantic texts to her mom announcing the good news. Upon learning of her song\u2019s resurgence some 40 years later, Sharpe couldn\u2019t believe it had found such a broad and passionate fan base. \u201cIt is a cute song, but I had totally forgotten about it,\u201d sheÂ toldÂ Jeffrey Sheban in a 2011 Columbus DispatchÂ interview. Sadly, Jay Robinson passed away before the song made it on theÂ Blue ValentineÂ soundtrack, and Sharpe\u2019s brother DonaldÂ diedÂ in 2014. Despite the loss of some of the original artists involved with the demo, it continues to endure. \u201cYou and Me\u201d seems to have taken on a life of its own over the past five decades and will likely continue to inspire new listeners for many years to come. As The Numero GroupÂ saidÂ on their website, the song, \u201ccould not be suppressed: not when Prix failed to release it; not when Penny & the Quarters were forgotten; not when Numero stuck it at the bitter end of a much overlooked compilation.\u201d (This article is a modified and updated version of a story thatÂ originally appeared on theÂ Micro-ChopÂ Medium publication.)
