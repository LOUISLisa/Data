Shell is looking for \u201cblockchain analysts\u201d as part of its Information Technology (IT) graduate programme, according to aÂ job listing on its graduate careers website. The job role has seemingly flown under the radar for the last four months after being posted toÂ LinkedIn. According to theÂ job specification, the placement will take place in Shell\u2018s Blockchain Centre of Excellence (CoE). But what does a \u201cblockchain analyst\u201d even do? Well, successful applicants will explore potential new applications of the decentralized technology across all of Shell\u2018s business areas \u2013 from its core in oil and gas to new energies and electric vehicles. They will be responsible for taking potential use cases from \u201cideation\u201d through to implementation. This will include finding new applications of not just blockchain but other decentralized technologies. It\u2019ll then be the responsibility of the analyst to sell these potential uses to the rest of the business, theÂ job listing states. Shell is looking for recent Master\u2019s graduates with backgrounds in the following disciplines: mathematics, computer science, and artificial intelligence.Indeed, it makes sense that Shell is looking for the next generation of business-based blockchain proponents. In November last year, the Dutch firm took part in launching aÂ blockchain-based platform for trading oil, that is replacing a centuries old, traditionally paper-based, process. What\u2019s more, the fact that Shell is hiring graduates points to a greater trend uncovered earlier this month. Data gathered by Hard Fork showed that the blockchain industry\u2018s biggest employers areÂ actually old-school corporate firmsÂ like Deloitte, IBM, Accenture, Oracle, and KPMG.
