    "Body": "EN EN ES ZH WE'RE BUILDING STABILITY TOGETHER At CementDAO, we\u2019re building a new kind of global currency. One that lives in the futuristic ether, but is built for the world we live in today. BUILD WITH US THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM Crypto currencies are too volatile to be used as the everyday currencies we are all familiar with. Â  Stablecoins are emerging as a viable alternative, reducing volatility to bring crypto to the masses. AND YET... Successful Adoption is being diluted. \u200b With over 150 stablecoins, the market has become fragmented, leading to confusion and creating more risks. Instead of increasing adoption of crypto, this fragmented ecosystem is now becoming a barrier to adoption. THE STABLE REPORT WHAT IS CEMENTDAO BUILD WITH US CEMENT IS A BASKETÂ OF MANY STABLECOINS Stablecoin holders can deposit their stablecoins into the Mixer (that\u2019s what we\u2019re calling the basket), to benefit from increased liquidity, greater stability and protection from risk. THE MIXRÂ PROVIDES ON DEMAND LIQUIDITY AND DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGE FOR STABLECOINS Depositing a stablecoin in the Mixer allows you to seamlessly exchange it for any other stablecoin in the Mixer. For example, a holder of TUSD can easily pay a provider that only accepts DAI. PREDICT AND BET WHICH STABLECOINS GO IN THE MIXR USD-pegged stablecoins (e.g. TUSD, USDT, DAI) deposited in the mixÂ are hedged from risk, become fungible and benefit from pooled liquidity sources. MANAGING RISKÂ AND REWARDS BASED ON USER PREFERENCE CementDAO creates a marketplace for risk. Users are protected from the risk of failure of any of the underlying stablecoins and from diversification of their exposure. They also have the option to earn returns by absorbing this risk. These rewards are paid out from the fees collected by the Mixer. Â© Copyright 2019Â by 1A1Z Ltd. All rights reserved. Privacy Policy."
