The successful gambling platform is certainly global in vision, with around 1,100 physical retail locations and a massive online and mobile presence. All this is supported by a team of over 6,000 employees in 33 countries and requires an extensive recruitment effort to maintain. Tipico, in particular, operate via a decentralized model which aims to find and pick only the highest quality candidates. A challenging task to be sure, especially if you are not being backed up by the right application tracking system. \u201cWhat\u2019s improved drastically is how quick we start receiving applications. In general, as soon as a role is live and we share it via social media, the applications start to come in.\u201d Jonathan PaceHR Marketing Manager Challenges The kind of approach favored by Tipico does not come without its challenges. For example, how do you ensure all of your recruiters and hiring managers are achieving the same high level of quality? How do you ensure processes are standardized in terms of protocol and brand? This latter point was particularly important to Tipico\u2019s HR Manager, Jonathan Pace. He explained: \u201cOur brand requires creating an experience that impresses candidates, demonstrates our employee values, and makes communications easier to achieve high performance HR marketing.\u201d These were the issues Tipico had to contend with while using their legacy talent acquisition platform. In particular, it\u2019s lack of easily accessible metrics, visibility and collaboration meant it presented a vague candidate experience at best, and certainly not one which promoted the brand message Tipico desired. Solution What Tipico needed was an ATS which provided the data they required, without wrestling control from recruiters across the globe. Faced with this, Tipico placed a winning bet with SmartRecruiters. Here are just some of the ways SmartRecruiters unravelled Tipico\u2019s cumbersome recruitment process: SmartRecruiters allowed Tipico to easily create their own career page and draw metrics from it. This created a \u2018one-stop-shop\u2019 which allowed Tipico to reclaim their brand and espouse it effectively. The ability to work their social media channels seamlessly into the platform also allowed Tipico to effectively target more passive candidates who appreciate their brand. The collaborative philosophy of SmartRecruiters meant hiring managers discussed candidates for longer, and in more depth. Ultimately, this resulted in higher quality hires and a better candidate experience. All this, plus the ability to conveniently track each candidate from one dashboard, has also reduced their reliance on external recruiters, ultimately saving them money.
