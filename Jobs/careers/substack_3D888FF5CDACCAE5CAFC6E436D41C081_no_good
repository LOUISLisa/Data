If you\u2019ve ever wanted advice from a Twitter-addled gay Mexican with anxiety, here is your chance.

I recently discovered I'm a lesbian, which was a huge deal for me. I won't get into it, but there were a lot of bumps along the way and huge lifestyle changes, including breaking up with my significant other. I'm not out to anyone besides my dad, my therapist, and my ex, all of whom have been neutral to supportive. Telling people is still scary considering I live in a red state and am surrounded by those who would not approve, but I carefully decided that I would tell a few of my friends whom I trust.Â  I expected at least some kind of response, but got absolutely nothing. It's been a few days now, and I'm feeling awful about it. My ex said it\u2019s maybe better that they didn't care at all, which means they're not homophobic. Sure, they may not care that I'm gay, but they also may not care about me as a person. I have no idea if I'm overreacting. I don't wanna say I'm spiraling, but I'm spiraling. Tell me how to feel, Papi! Signed, Lesbian and Lonely Hi there, LL! Congrats on being gay. HOME TEAM! Don\u2019t forget to sign up for the benefits package. I definitely understand where you\u2019re coming from. Sometimes things happen in our lives that have a certain gravity, and when we share them with the people we love we of course want them to recognize the weight\u2014of the joy, or the sadness, or the accomplishment, or all of the above. Indeed, LL, I wish you\u2019d gotten that here. Whether it\u2019s coming out or getting a new job or going through a breakup, it\u2019s always nice to feel like the people in your life get why something is important to you. But \u201cit\u2019d be nice if...\u201d is pretty terrible advice. In fact, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s advice at all. And We Built This City on Advice, so here\u2019s something productive we can do. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve had a lot of difficulty dealing with, but has made me a lot more content: You have to accept that you can\u2019t control how people react to you. I\u2019m a writer, you know, so a lot of what I do involves trying to conduct people\u2019s emotions in a certain way. When I make something, I do have a certain degree of intention for the public reaction. I would certainly like it if, for example, people felt sad when I aimed for them to feel sad, or if they laughed when I tried to be funny. The reality is much messier, though. Everyone is unique, and people bring their own tastes and points of view to the table. It\u2019s not always or even usually going to be the case that the majority of my readers will respond the way I want. If I focus too hard on that aspect of the process, I end up not so much \u201cmaking\u201d as I do \u201ccatering.\u201d I think that applies to a lot of things in life, LL. We all, to some degree, cater. We take how other people might react to us into consideration, we want to please people, or we want to conduct people, or, or, or. It\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing! But oftentimes we end up undervaluing our own thoughts and feelings because we\u2019re so reliant on feedback.Â  I guess what I\u2019m asking is: Can you be satisfied with your coming out being important for you? That\u2019s not a trick question! If you think it\u2019s special, and an accomplishment, and a big deal, well, can that be enough? Do you need the people around you to acknowledge it as such in order to affirm your feelings?Â  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not saying they should be like \u201cwho care!\u201d But I believe you said they were neutral to positive. I think that\u2019s fine! That\u2019s a whole lot better than \u201cnegative to hostile.\u201d I think their true reaction will reveal itself in time: if they treat you the same, if they welcome your new girlfriend or don\u2019t shut you down when you talk about That Gay Shitâ¢, well, those are good friends. That\u2019s the good stuff. Share It\u2019s a rough world, LL. There are still a lot of people out there whose hobbies involve making people feel worse about themselves. There\u2019s no telling what\u2019s going to come our way, or who is going to give it to us (speaking as a fellow red-stater). That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important to have confidence in yourself and to be able to affirm yourself.Â  Without that, we end up at the mercy of other people. And while I\u2019ve met quite a few good people, I much prefer the stability that supporting myself provides. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s stuck with me, and so I might as well call the shots around here. If it makes you feel better, though, I love that you\u2019re gay! That\u2019s neat. You\u2019re gay, and that\u2019s good. I\u2019m gay too. Proud of you. Keep it up!
