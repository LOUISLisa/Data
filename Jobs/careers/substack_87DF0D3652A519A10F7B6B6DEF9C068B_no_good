John Paul Brammer Jun 13 50 Sign up to like post Subscribe LoginPrivacyTerms 9 Share One of the most foundational reading experiences of my young life was the Left Behind (For Kids) series, a violently protestant YA spinoff collection of books about the Christian rapture by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. I grew up in the Catholic Church, but despite my theological differences with LaHaye and Jenkins I still avidly consumed these books, which I saw more as \u201cAction & Adventure\u201d than \u201cYouth Pastor Propaganda.\u201d As we hurdle through our own apocalypse of sorts, I\u2019ve found myself thinking of these weird, wild books and wanting to share the experience with my good pals, the subscribers of this newsletter. So, just for you, dear reader, I\u2019m going to recreate them from memory so you can join me in reflecting on their lessons and what they have to say about the end of the world. I haven\u2019t read them since 2005, so some details might be a bit fuzzy. You\u2019ll just have to deal with that. Well OK here I go. Our story begins with Capital-G God poof-ing all the Good Onesâ¢ from earth. There\u2019s a pilot on a plane and he\u2019s just sort of zapped from existence leaving only his clothes behind because you\u2019re raptured naked and the rest is drag. The plane crashes but it\u2019s fine because it was full of bad people. I don\u2019t know where this happens exactly so let\u2019s just say Chicago.Â  Well, the bad news is you live in Chicago and the pilotless plane crashes into your home. Really stressful day, all in all. The plane crashes into your home at just the right angle to kill your sinner dad but not you or your sinner mom. You\u2019re both distraught over this and there\u2019s fire everywhere, so know that. You pick through the burning remains of your filthy heathen house and manage to make it out. RIP to your dad, but maybe if he\u2019d simply been better he wouldn\u2019t have been in that situation. \u201cWhy has this happened to us,\u201d you ask your mom, who like you is a rotten person that God looked at and thought, nah. \u201cWhy did the plane fall from the sky and punish us thus?\u201dÂ  It\u2019s at this point that you and your mom, who I don\u2019t feel like characterizing, see people\u2019s clothes scattered everywhere because God snapped his cosmic fingers and made that happen. But you don\u2019t know that yet so it\u2019s really confusing for you. \u201cWe should find Pastor Bruce,\u201d your empty void of a mother says out of plot convenience. Seriously this woman could be anyone, I don\u2019t care. You and your pixelated mom go find Pastor Bruce who couldn\u2019t have been that great of a pastor if he\u2019s still here after the rapture, honestly. But that makes him deep because he\u2019s flawed, and as we all know flawed characters are good. Anyway you go ask your fraudulent pastor who didn\u2019t make God\u2019s final cut why God is doing all this. Good luck with that. \u201cI think God did this,\u201d Pastor Bruce says. In my mind Pastor Bruce was hot because I was gay and always pictured the men being hot when books didn\u2019t go out of their way to make them ugly. So whatever \u201chot man\u201d looks like to you, put that in some Birkenstocks and frosted tips. Very \u201cyouth pastor in 2002.\u201d That\u2019s Pastor Bruce. \u201cI read about this in the Bible, the book that we all know and I should have read better. This is the rapture and God is rapturing us.\u201d Your mom goes away at this point because she knows this is a teen action story and she can\u2019t stick around. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ll miss her. Anyway, you, a teen, are now left to team up with sexy Pastor Bruce, which you do because oh shit oh no you\u2019ve got to fight the ANTICHRIST.Â  Not only do you and Pastor Bruce have to fight the antichrist, but God feels like fucking with the human trash he LEFT BEHINDâ¢ because well that\u2019s the mood he\u2019s in and what can we do about it. You\u2019ve also got earthquakes and fires and plagues and swarms of insects to deal with. These are important because we need them to pick off your team one by one ahead of the final confrontation.Â  Oh, yes, the team. I honestly don\u2019t have time to bring everyone together individually so pretend the gang\u2019s all here and they all have tragic backstories that are super compelling.Â  Pastor Bruce sexily leads you to a room in his failed church where ten or so other teens are waiting for you and holding Bibles. Cool Bibles, though. Like maybe one is camo themed and anyway these are cool youths who just so happen to be Christians, which, it must be said, is a kind of dorky religion. They recently converted after Pastor Bruce told them that God hadn\u2019t chosen them just like when Tyra doesn\u2019t take some of the contestants to Paris in America\u2019s Next Top Model. They call themselves the Tribulation Force, which is a pretty decent name. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Annie,\u201d your love interest says. \u201cMy entire family was killed in one of the subsequent earthquakes God sent for shits and giggles. It made me start believing in him because honestly I\u2019m terrified and I don\u2019t think he will leave me alone until I pray a lot.\u201d You fall in love out of obligation to the genre but there\u2019s not much you can do about it because you\u2019ve got to go fight the antichrist, Nicolae Carpathia, the head of the United Nations and the former prime minister of Romania. So, you know. Huge get for Romania there. Carpathia\u2019s goals are quite simple: mandate homosexuality, ban gender, eat babies, socialize medicine, and institute a universal language. Calm down, Bernie Sanders! Am I right? He\u2019s also very good looking because he\u2019s the devil and people tend to love him because their lives are shit thanks to neoliberalism. He even has Americans willing to attempt learning a second language, which is terrifying on its own merits.Â  \u201cWe\u2019ve got to bring this son of a bitch down,\u201d Pastor Bruce says, flashing the gumption that was probably why God wasn\u2019t really feeling him. \u201cBut how? We\u2019re a small team of one hot youth pastor and YA teens on the outskirts of Chicago, and he\u2019s the head of the United Nations.\u201d \u201cI have an idea,\u201d one of the teens says, a convert from some exotic religion that brown people like, as proof that neither LaHaye nor Jenkins are racist. Let\u2019s say he\u2019s Buddhist. Anyway, he has a plan. \u201cWe can fix the plane that killed the protagonist\u2019s dad, fly it to the United Nations, and pray Nicolae Carpathia to death at point blank range.\u201d You all put your heads together and fix the murder plane and before you know it you\u2019re all well on your way to the United Nations, the headquarters of which has been relocated to Romania which was already drunk with power after the antichrist chose them as his host country like Elon Musk is flirting with doing in Tulsa.Â  \u201cWe are here in Romania,\u201d Annie says. \u201cBut we\u2019re so tired from reconstructing that plane and flying all night so why don\u2019t we rest up in this house until tomorrow?\u201d You all agree, displaying the poor judgment that probably prevented you all from being in heaven right now in the first place. You set up camp inside some house that used to belong to someone who got raptured because God loved them more.Â Â Â  Sleeping in sleeping bags on the floor, Annie whispers that she has something to confess. \u201cThere\u2019s something in my heart I\u2019ve been wanting to tell you about,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes\u2026 when I look at you\u2026 I feel\u2026\u201d Oh NO it\u2019s another one of God\u2019s EARTHQUAKES. God starts shaking the earth like a snow globe and the roof falls apart and one of the beams impales Annie. \u201cOOF!\u201d she says. \u201cNot good.\u201dÂ  \u201cThis is not an ideal situation,\u201d you say. Some other members died too but I don\u2019t care really. \u201cStay with me, Annie. You hear me? Stay with me!\u201d \u201cOK, but why?\u201d Annie asks. \u201cI kind of feel like if I die I\u2019ll go to heaven at this point and if I don\u2019t I\u2019ll have a massive hole in my stomach. Like, maybe I should just die here? The stakes are really unclear but I guess that\u2019s the problem when you introduce a definite afterlife into the story.\u201d \u201cWell then die I guess,\u201d you say, and she does. Maybe she\u2019s in heaven now who knows. \u201cOh no, Annie died,\u201d Pastor Bruce with the massive biceps says. \u201cThat sucks. We have to go confront Nicolae Carpathia now before he ends the world, which would be bad I guess because God isn\u2019t done playing with it.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d you say. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d But before you do Nicolae Carpathia\u2019s soldiers show up and arrest all of you. They\u2019re probably wearing shiny black helmets and body armor that says \u201cSTILL WITH HER\u201d on it or something. \u201cWe\u2019re taking you to the boss,\u201d they say, which is handy. You make your way through the swarms of locusts having an absolute locust rave in Romania to Nicolae Carpathia\u2019s house which is just a house. You and what\u2019s left of your team, certainly not Annie who\u2019s way dead because she\u2019s a girl, prepare for your final confrontation with the antichrist who at this point really hasn\u2019t accomplished a whole lot? I feel like it\u2019s mostly been God killing people but you\u2019re really not beating God in a fight so let\u2019s focus on this fruitcake who wants \u201cone world currency\u201d or whatever. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you, Tribulation Force,\u201d Nicolae Carpathia says, homosexually. \u201cYou\u2019ve foiled approximately none of my plans but that\u2019s fine because I\u2019m not sure what they were. Well, I\u2019m in a bit of a bind here because I guess I could kill you but I\u2019m not sure what that would do. Like, you\u2019re either going to heaven, which is good, or hell, which is where I live. So.\u201d Pastor Bruce shoots Nicolae Carpathia with his legally obtained firearm and that\u2019s kind of that. \u201cThat was for Jesus!\u201d he shouts, and the gay guards clap and convert to Christianity. \u201cGender is good,\u201d one says. \u201cBut only if there are two of them.\u201d At this point a beam of light shines through the window of Nicolae Carpathia\u2019s normal house and Jesus floats down. \u201cThank you,\u201d Jesus says. \u201cThat's what I wanted you to do. You can come to heaven now. Sorry for not letting you in earlier we just wanted to test you because we\u2019re really bored there\u2019s like nothing happening up there.\u201dÂ  \u201cCan I ask one thing before I go?\u201d You say. \u201cIs\u2026 is Annie up there with you?\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d Jesus asks. You all go up to heaven where your dad is waiting for you. Your mom might be up there somewhere but who cares. She might still be alive, sinning in obscurity. Annie comes to greet you. \u201cGood job,\u201d she says. \u201cUltimately I was right about dying. It\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t think it mattered much.\u201d You kiss and that\u2019s the end. That sure was apocalyptic. I hope you learned a thing or two about the end of the world. That\u2019s all from me. Don\u2019t get impaled by a roof beam we\u2019re actually not sure if there\u2019s a heaven. 50 Sign up to like post Subscribe LoginPrivacyTerms 9 Recreating the 'Left Behind' Books From MemoryLet's get apocalyptic.

I was too old to read these, so my engagement is limited to debating whether to recycle the books when I find them in Little Free Libraries. 2 Sign up to like comment Subscribe LoginPrivacyTermsReply Gerald DudleyJun 20 I read most of these, but then stopped about two thirds of the way because I stopped believing in God, but I remember later picking up the last one of the series and thumbing through it in a bookstore once and my eyes nearly rolled out of my danged head. 1 Sign up to like comment Subscribe LoginPrivacyTermsReply7 more comments\u2026 TopNewCommunityWhat is Â¡Hola Papi!?About Ready for more?
