I've been recovering for the last four years, but every time my peers talk about being excited to learn new things, or pick up new skills, I get horrible anxiety.Â  I feel like I'm going to be left behind. But whenever I open a new software or start a new project, I just stare at it, and don't know where to start. I'm constantly overwhelmed. Now I'm at the point where my younger peers are outpacing me, and between that and knowing that I only have a finite amount of time to do the things I love, I'm losing my mind. What I\u2019m asking is, how do I fall back in love with drawing? Signed, Over Analyst Howdy, OA! Ah, yes, to have the soft, squishy, flexible mind of a child. Wouldn\u2019t that be nice? Well, I actually don\u2019t know if children\u2019s minds work that way. I avoid them for the most part, to be honest, and I\u2019m not a child scientist. But you\u2019re not here to listen to me talk about what I don\u2019t know. So here\u2019s what I do know: it\u2019s perfectly natural to experience anxiety before engaging in something new, and in our present economic system we are given ample reasons to question the validity of attempting it in the first place. Will I be good enough at this activity to monetize it? Will I ever be the best? What\u2019s the point, if so many people are going to be better at this than me? These are just a few of the nagging questions one might raise before jumping into something new, especially if that something is associated with creative outlets that typically don\u2019t pay well (poetry, drawing, etc).Â  I would also say from personal experience that those of us with an inkling to create stuff often have an idea of the beautiful, fulfilling things we\u2019d like to make while at the same time understanding just how many hours we\u2019ll have to log into the craft before we can even approach realizing them.Â  For me, drawing is a good example. I had a knack for it as a child, and I wanted to be a visual artist. Over time, though, I got overwhelmed by all the education I\u2019d need, the tools I\u2019d have to acquire, and the sheer amount of time I\u2019d have to pour into it. I chose writing instead, because I loved writing just as much, and I found it to be more applicable to the job market.Â  But I never stopped dreaming of shapes in my head, the things I wanted so badly to create, and it was a sort of anguish for me not to be able to manifest them, to tilt my skull and pour them out onto something. Such was this discomfort that, once a year or so, I\u2019d experience a fit of productivity where I\u2019d go out, buy a bunch of paper and pencils and brushes, and try, fruitlessly, to make, make, make. It\u2019s a frustrating thing, OA, to be limited by your own ability. Which is why I think we need a different approach. See, I wanted so badly for the act of drawing to give me the final product I dreamt of. I thought in terms of perfect results. I didn\u2019t think of the process, of the pleasures of just moving a pencil around, of the private happiness of engaging with art for art\u2019s sake, or the satisfaction of devoting myself to a craft. It makes perfect sense for us to think in terms of products. Even if we never sell our art, capitalism shapes our relationships to leisure, creativity, and self-expression. We want to be \u201cgood\u201d at something. We want to be appreciated, and we want to execute our goals as flawlessly as possible. This isn\u2019t because we\u2019re greedy or shallow. I think it\u2019s because we are conditioned this way. Share So what I think might help you, because it helped me, is to find new ways of approaching activities that bring you joy or enrichment. I honed in on you saying younger people are outpacing you, because that\u2019s exactly how I saw things, and sometimes, out of anxiety, still see them that way. Everything is a race. Everything is a score. Everything is a matter of cruel arithmetic: I only have x many years, y many opportunities, and there are z many people outdoing me at all times. But what I\u2019ve learned is that I\u2019m not in competition with other people in that way. I am on a mission to become myself, the most me that I can be, and as my abilities improve, the shapes in my head respond, change, and what I\u2019m left with isn\u2019t something that can easily be compared to anyone else. It\u2019s an entirely unique articulation of me, of the things in my head.Â  My advice, OA, is to push other people out of your mind. Don\u2019t think of it as a contest. I think of it more like prayer, or like dutifully nurturing a plant. It\u2019s a quiet, personal act of devotion, one that can bring clarity of mind. The process itself can be so rewarding. When I think of it that way, it takes all the pressure off of me to be better than someone else or worry if what I\u2019m doing is a productive use of my time.Â  Take a deep breath, take your first step, and see where the road takes you. That being said, buy my art.
