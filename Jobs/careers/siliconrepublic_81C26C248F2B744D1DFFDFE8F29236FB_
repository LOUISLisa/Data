Image: Wachsman You\u2019re going to work in blockchain whether you want to or not by Eva Short 20 Nov 20181.52k Views Though research shows that Irish people are hesitant to dive into blockchain in their professional lives, David Wachsman is confident that it\u2019s inevitable not only for you, but your little dog, too. Blockchain elicits all reactions and none. The response from people when the topic is broached can range from a blank stare to a laboured sigh. Some know blockchain only through bitcoin, others don\u2019t know it at all. A small cohort of people will nearly scratch a cornea rolling their eyes at its mere mention, deriding it as a fad. David Wachsman, founder and CEO of Wachsman, certainly disagrees with the technology\u2019s detractors. He, described by Crunchbase as a \u201cworld-renowned blockchain expert and thought leader\u201d, welcomed me in the glass conference room of his company\u2019s Dublin office. This office recently announced the expansion of its functions beyond PR, now offering a broad swathe of blockchain professional services to clients such as Dash, CoinDesk, Indiegogo, Kik and more. David has been away from his native New York and hopping between Wachsman\u2019s hubs in Ireland and Singapore, the latter of which recently opened. He has been living out of a suitcase for the better part of three months, though it shows neither in his temperament nor appearance. Serene and self-possessed, sitting in the house that blockchain built, his (professional) house, he is confident enough in Ireland\u2019s blockchain scene to double down on his commitment to it. He is baffled that the majority of Irish people, according to research recently published by the company, disagree with him. As many as 75pc of people say they would not consider a career in the area. \u201cMost people don\u2019t know what blockchain is, that\u2019s what our findings found. They don\u2019t get it. To them, it\u2019s simply some buzzword technology. That\u2019s a big PR problem. It\u2019s also a problem for companies that are building out in the space, and we have many here in Ireland who are doing that.\u201d The blockchain ecosystem in Dublin is in pretty good condition. A healthy mix of blockchain-focused companies such as ConsenSys have operations here. Many of the large consultancy firms have dedicated blockchain labs. Finance giants such as Fidelity Investments and Mastercard have poured resources into gaining a foothold in blockchain. \u201cAll the big tech giants, some of them probably secretly, are looking to hire people with blockchain backgrounds here in Dublin.\u201d Blockchain\u2019s inevitable takeover The proliferation of blockchain technology is as inevitable as the tide coming in. It\u2019ll wash over us all in a matter of time. The march of technological progress is as unrelenting as the spinning of our Earth. It won\u2019t be a case of an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object \u2013 you will be moved into working in blockchain. Though many in the Wachsman survey cited an inappropriate educational background as a reason they would not want to wade into it, the worker of tomorrow will likely learn on the job. Hiring Now Life-changing career opportunities for you A dynamic and rapidly expanding company Invent. Impact. Inspire. Informing, entertaining and connecting the world \u201cAlmost everyone today works at an internet company. The company itself may not be actually building websites but they probably have one. The company itself isn\u2019t developing email applications but I guarantee you they use [them], or a chat app. Blockchain companies are going to be just like that in future. Blockchain will be a piece of the technology stack that people use every single day.\u201d For now, most of the blockchain jobs lie in building infrastructure, and the roles are mostly developer roles. David maintains, however, that this is temporary.\u201cTomorrow, it\u2019s going to be every company. I think [workers] are going to gain their skills by simply working with companies endeavouring blockchain.\u201d Steel, your dog and your mobile phone This inevitability doesn\u2019t address the fact that people still neither understand nor trust blockchain as a technology. If it is going to be such a large element of the future of work, as David implies, then a huge obstacle will have to be overcome in order to attract workers to the area. \u201cWe need to do a better job of educating. That means 101-type pieces, that means meet-ups, that means lectures. We need universities to chip in a bit because that\u2019s what they\u2019re really good at: teaching complicated concepts to people.\u201d More importantly, David adds, a \u201cbig consumer-y brand\u201d or website needs to adopt blockchain. Airlines need to tokenise loyalty points. It needs to be normalised, which will likely happen. The question is, by whom? David cites in particular blockchain\u2019s potential application to the supply chain as the use case he is most excited about \u201cbecause it\u2019s boring\u201d. Supply chains are complicated and expensive with a huge amount of moving parts. Maximising the efficiency of this process by reliably tracking all the various extenuating factors could lower the price of materials such as steel. \u201cThat changes the world.\u201d Moving away from the macro, David opines that man\u2019s best friend could end up having as much of a relationship with blockchain as humans. Blockchain, though it\u2019s \u201cpeer-to-peer trading of value\u201d, could easily be applied to energy. \u201cIf your dog were wearing a little backpack with a solar panel on it, that dog, cute as it might be, would be an energy producer. Because of the nature of how energy transmission works, the further you are away from the energy producer, the more is wasted. Imagine your dog being able to power, or at least being able to recharge, your cellphone.\u201d Hello Brexit, goodbye blockchain Thanks to Brexit, Ireland can expect for its blockchain industry, and therefore the number of blockchain jobs, to only grow with time. This is in line with the general jobs boon that Ireland is experiencing as the UK, rather disastrously, attempts to negotiate its way out of the single market. Companies such as Coinbase have announced plans to set up shop in Dublin, citing concerns about Brexit. \u201cIreland is a very important part of Europe. It\u2019s the only English-speaking EU country, and Britain is making damn sure of that. I would say that as a launch pad for Europe, it\u2019s a vital place for companies to set up \u2013 blockchain companies [in particular] because it is such a borderless enterprise. So many of the applications of blockchain must be international, that\u2019s what makes them so effective. This distributed database must be distributed.\u201d Tweet Share Email Share More Share Pin This Reddit Related: blockchain, research, PR, Brexit, future of work By Eva Short Eva Short was a Journalist at Silicon Republic specialising in the areas of tech, data privacy, business, cybersecurity, AI, automation and future of work, among others.
