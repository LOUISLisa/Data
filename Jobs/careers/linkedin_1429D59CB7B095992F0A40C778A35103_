This is a unique opportunity to shape the growth of Slack and an entire industry by ensuring Slack is \u201cwhere work gets done\", especially as the world shifts to remote. This product manager will join the Monetization team, with the initial responsibility to improve the experience of purchasing Slack\u2019s premium products. You\u2019re constantly identifying user problems and thinking critically about which to prioritize. You know how to measure and interpret the results of your team\u2019s efforts. You love working on teams, side-by-side with the best engineers and designers. You easily manage several projects at once and you don\u2019t miss deadlines. Slack has a positive, diverse, and supportive culture\u2014we look for people who are curious, inventive, and work to be a little better every single day. In our work together we aim to be smart, humble, hardworking and, above all, collaborative. If this sounds like a good fit for you, why not say hello? What You Will Be Doing You will develop the product vision, strategy, and roadmap for improving the purchase experience for Slack\u2019s paid features in concert with cross-functional peers. You\u2019ll become an authority on your product area. You\u2019ll identify customer needs and business opportunities through a combination of research, feedback collection from cross-functional teammates and competitive data analysis. You\u2019ll define, understand, and improve key funnels and metrics. You\u2019ll own features and experiments end-to-end, including writing product specs, driving cross-functional execution, making thoughtful product decisions along the way, and sharing insights and results throughout the company. You\u2019ll drive execution against our plan in collaboration with Engineering and Design peers: making trade-offs, anticipating staffing needs and risks, and ensuring frequent and clear communication. What You Should Have Passion about Slack and the problem we\u2019re solving. At least 3+ years of experience leading major product or growth initiatives across user-facing products. You can take rough themes and turn them into a roadmap of features, experiments, and research with minimal guidance. Impact focus and a consistent history of delivering measurable results for both users and the business. Data-minded whenever possible. You deeply understand how your products work and how to measure long-term impact. You can design, run, and interpret experiments and A/B tests, and probably know a bit of SQL. Comfort working on technical problems (e.g. billing). Ability to think big and small to build a portfolio of experiments and larger features. You are as comfortable whiteboarding a completely new experience as you are optimizing an existing flow and know when to do which. Impeccable follow-through. You say what you\u2019ll do, and do what you say. You hold your team to this standard. You don\u2019t let details slip. Product taste and craft. You will own important product interactions with every Slack customer, and should show the attention to detail this responsibility deserves. You listen well. You build consensus by default, but can drive hard decisions when needed. You push the pace. You take blame and pass on praise. People love working with you.
