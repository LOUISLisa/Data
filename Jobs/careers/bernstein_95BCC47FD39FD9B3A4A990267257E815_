The current IP rights system, however, is failing to pick up the pace - it's too slow, expensive, fragmented and leaves many innovators at risk and looking for alternatives to secure their ideas. In this context, blockchain technology is the perfect, universal public registry humanity needs and deserves. Bernstein aims to become the gateway to conveniently, privately and globally secure pioneers' rights over their creations.
