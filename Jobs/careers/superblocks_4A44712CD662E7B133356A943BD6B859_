There\u2019s bound to be an economic crisis any time now, the blockchain industry has powerful enemies and the hard truth is many startups faill.Â Accepting a vocation at a blockchain startup is a high-risk proposition. If this is a turn off for you we suggest you click here to escape now. You\u2019re still here. Maybe because you know that high risk usually comes with a high reward. Maybe you\u2019re curious on what that reward might be? Maybe you are here because you are passionate about a decentralized future and look forward to disrupt the centralized systems that run the world today? To be fair, we\u2019re not just any blockchain startup. We are Superblocks. We kit developers servicesÂ to build DApps, decentralized apps on blockchain, and by doing so we empower innovation for a decentralized future. And this is why we exist, to strive for a decentralized future.Â  Current positions Open Application Stockholm Stockholm Remote Ãstermalmsgatan 26A 114 26 Stockholm Directions hello@superblocks.com View page Remote 111 52 Stockholm Directions View page Decentralization is our DNA This means we\u2019re structuring our work in a completely decentralized manner. Working at Superblocks you\u2019ll manage your own time, have no boss to control you or tell you what to do (but of course you\u2019re always free to discuss and seek advise with the team), and you\u2019ll be free to work from wherever you like. The seed of Superblocks was planted by Thomas that sold his belongings and moved into the wild bringing only what he could carry including a tent, some solar panels and his computer to focus solely on writing code. In other words this is no corporate fluff fluff but lies within the core seed of Superblocks. It runs through our veins. Sounds good? Read about our open positions and send us a greetingÂ here!
