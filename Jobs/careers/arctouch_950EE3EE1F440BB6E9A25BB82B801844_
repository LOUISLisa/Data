Besides the encouragement with English and technical resources, ArcTouch takes an interest in its internal community by always encouraging events that support professional growth and development. This makes it possible to promote staff development, both technically and on soft skills. Additionally, the environment is super friendly with many people from different places - and I have great friends here. Another cool thing I see here is that people care to help, teach, and share knowledge, and this is in addition to having internal events that make sharing possible. I would say: ArcTouch is such an excellent place to work and grow professionally.
