Firms like Facebook, Apple, Google, Netflix, and Amazon are all viewed as target companies for most engineers. However, even these giants are rapidly losing their best developers to the growing blockchain industry. Engineers\u2019 Fascination with Blockchain Technology A lot of these technicians, such as Facebook\u2019s former engineer Maximilian Wang, or Qi Zhou, who worked at both,Â FacebookÂ andÂ Google, have left these firms to pursue the blockchain. They were among those who discovered blockchain technology relatively early, meaning prior to the explosion of cryptocurrency in 2017. Ever since then, they were fascinated by it, and they quickly became investors into crypto. Despite the fact that this was only a little over a year ago, blockchain and cryptocurrency were still far from being as well-known as they are today. Because of that, even the most optimistic investors had doubts, but also strong faith in the new tech. After the crypto craze kicked off, numerous investors such as Preethi KasireddyÂ decided to leaveÂ their former positions and try their luck in the blockchain world. While this was undoubtedly a big risk to take, they believed that it was worth taking. The blockchain world greeted them with open arms. Not only are engineers coming from big companies highly skilled and sought after in the crypto and blockchain industries, but their background also brings new credibility to these projects. It is known how difficult it can be to get a good position in firms like Google, Facebook, or Amazon. And when someone from those position leaves for a specific blockchain project, that is a big nod to this project\u2019s quality and potential. Furthermore,Â  a lot of engineers in these companies are young people, in their late 20\u2019s or early 30\u2019s, which allows them to quickly understand and accept new concepts. Why Crypto and Blockchain Won\u2019t Work Within Large Firms A lot of these engineers are not leaving tech firms for blockchain and crypto in their desire to earn better. Instead, they are leaving simply due to their belief in this technology, and its potential to take over traditional methods at some point in the future. They wish to help this technology reach that point. However, they cannot hope to work on theÂ blockchainÂ within the large companies. Some firms like Facebook have developed an interest in the blockchain, and have even launched teams that will research this technology. However, due to the fact that Facebook is a large, well-established company, it has far more restrictions than startups that are free to shape themselves however they like. Another large issue comes from ICOs. If Facebook were to launch an ICO, this would be a very sensitive project. It would have to be responsible to the shareholders, it would need good reasons for the move, and it would have to find a way to implement digital coins into its existing business model. These difficulties will likely prevent large firms from reaching out to blockchain and crypto in the near future. However, engineers and developers still believe that this technology is the future, and they are willing to risk their careers at the largest tech companies in order to help that future arrive sooner.

(computerworld.com) The demand for blockchain engineers or software developers has continued to skyrocket over the past year and salaries for those positions are growing in lockstep. The medianÂ salary for a blockchain developerÂ is now $127,000, with experienced individuals commanding upwards of $172,000 when they move to new organizations, according to Janco Associates, a management consulting firm that conducts regular salary surveys. [Â Read about the 2018 Best Places to Work in ITÂ ] \"ERP and Blockchain jobs are in great demand. Individuals can look forward to salaries continuing to increase,\" Janco CEO Victor Janulaitis said via email. Janco Associates Hired, a job recruitment firm, placed the salary for blockchain engineers even higher than Janco, saying theyÂ can command between $150,000 and $175,000Â a year; those jobs are now on par with developers of artificial intelligence (AI). By comparison, software engineers earn an average of $137,000, according to Hired CEO Mehul Patel. \"Since launching blockchain as an expertise on our platform in late 2017, we have witnessed demand for blockchain engineers increase 400%,\" Patel said via email. \"Interestingly, blockchain engineer has not solidified itself as a standalone job title quite yet; instead, blockchain is increasingly being included as an area of expertise for back-end, solutions architects and machine-learning engineers. \"Blockchain, Patel said, is poised to transform everything from how people verify their identities to how money is transferred, and so is expected to have longevity as a career option. [Â Looking to upgrade your career in tech? This comprehensive online course teaches you how.Â ] \"Combine its immense potential with the fact that it\u2019s a new and growing field, and I can see the demand for these roles remaining high for the foreseeable future,\" Patel said. AÂ recent surveyÂ by HIred found IT professionals are increasingly looking for a position that is challenging \u2014 with 64% indicating they\u2019d leave their job if another one offered new challenges and problems to solve. Career positions in AI/machine learning, devops and blockchain will continue to be on the cutting edge of technology, and a priority for hiring needs, Patel said. For those hiring and looking to provide competitive offers to candidates with blockchain or other in-demand skill sets, the option to work remotely is a good incentive. \"In fact, we conducted a recent survey that found that over half of tech talent are interested in working 100% remotely,\" Patel said. \"Offering remote work to fill the demand for blockchain and AI engineers might meet the talent demand for these future-focused companies. \"Over the past 12 months, total job openings for blockchain skills have grown to 12,006, according to job data analytics firmÂ Burning Glass Technologies. That represents a growth rate of 316% over that time frame. In June, Burning Glass Â reported 5,743 blockchain developer jobs. The median advertised salary for Software Developers requiring blockchain is $125,000 to $150,000, according to Burning Glass. Freelance job site,Â Upwork, said demand for blockchain-based positions has increased on average 96% quarter-to-quarter in terms of job postings; it sees Â blockchain development asÂ the hottest skill in the freelance job market today. Skills gap translates into higher pay People with experience using specific blockchain iterations such asÂ SolidityÂ andÂ Hyperledger ComposerÂ are in even higher demand - and that demand is increasing steadily, said Eric Piscini, CEO ofÂ Citizens ReserveÂ and formerly a principal in the technology and banking practices at Deloitte Consulting LLP. Janco Associates \"This is the number one thing I have in mind when I wake up in the morning: 'Where will I find more engineers to join the team,'\" he said in an earlier interview with Computerworld.In addition to postings at established companies such as Deloitte, 2,977 blockchain startupsÂ have posted 2,043 jobs, according to AngelList, a website for investors and job-seekers looking for work at startups. Even as companies are posting a plethora of blockchain jobs, there is a dearth of talent to fill them. According to Upwork's latest figures (posted in June), 53% of hiring managers surveyed cite access to skills as their biggest hiring challenge, and the majority (59%) are already utilizing flexible talent. The top blockchain jobs available todayÂ include entry-level and internship positions; Â blockchain engineers; blockchain project managers; and blockchain developers. The best career opportunities are now in financial services, government agencies and at tech companies; all are seeking ways blockchain can create new efficiencies. Other blockchain positions include quality engineers and legal consultants or attorneys, and blockchain web designers. Large organizations are also planning to beef up their middle management as they focus on Big Data, blockchain and smartphone and tablet connectivity, according to Janco. Where to get blockchain skills Most who choose to add blockchain to their skillset or seek a career as blockchain developers are typically versed in programming languages such as Java or Python, Piscini said. But that's by no means a prerequisite. \"More universities are starting curriculaÂ and the natural cycle to graduate enough students will produce good volumes in the next few years,\" Piscini said. \"We collaborate with universities around the world to develop content and hire the best talent. \"Several accredited U.S. universities now offer courses on blockchain,Â such as MIT, which has offered two courses onÂ cryptocurrency engineering and design, and Stanford University, which hasÂ a course called Bitcoin EngineeringÂ that teaches developers how to create bitcoin-enabled applications. There are also specialty schools, such as Mountain View, Calif.-basedÂ Blockchain UniversityÂ and London-based education startup B9lab, which launched an onlineÂ Certified Ethereum Developer TrainingÂ program in 2016. \"We've been running this and other courses for over two years now and have trained 1,000 people from over 75 countries,\" said Elias Haase, founder of B9lab.The most successful students in B9lab's courses tend to have sysadmin experience and have worked with Javascript before, Hasse said. But \"with the right amount of focus, we've seen people from different backgrounds do really well.\"Our youngest student was 14, the oldest 76. So we've seen a pretty broad variety of developers,\" he said. Currently, the easiest and fastest way to become proficient is toÂ learn on your ownÂ or attend programs organized by blockchain vendors and industry groups, such asÂ Consensys,Â Blockapps,Â the Ethereum FoundationÂ andÂ Hyperledger.

(information-age.com) Information Age's guide on how to introduce blockchain to your enterprise in the face of the digital skills crisis. Looking at everything, from upskilling schemes and outsourcing to how CTOs can impact change in relation to how universities shape their degrees With the proliferation of blockchain initiatives comes a unique need for a diverse range of skills, including engineering, app development,Â cyber security, and decentralised governance, to name just a few. All this makes for a criterion that is hard to meet. Beyond all the marketing and sales hype, blockchain has managed to establish itself as a realistic disrupter in the tech space, particularly for its potential ability to transform traditional business channels, supply chains and communications.Industry titans like Mastercard, IBM, British Airways and Samsung are just some of the organisations currently spearheading blockchain initiatives, and at the same time, blockchain-based start-ups are increasing at an agile rate. Between them, what they each hope to get out of their blockchain projects differs significantly. However, whatever their end-goal may be, they will all face similar roadblocks along the way.In this guide, I\u2019m going to talk about some of the ways CTOs can overcome some of these hurdles. However, instead of focusing on the limitations of the technology itself, I want to focus on one of the less talked about challenges facing CTOs and their utilisation of blockchain: finding the talent to use it. The talent shortage in blockchain The skills shortage relating to blockchain has become a real pain for IT leaders who desperately want to experiment with it.Of course, the lack of talent is not exclusive to blockchain, CTOs looking to incorporate things like; AI, machine learning or big data, I\u2019m sure, know this only too well. >See also:Â Closing the skills gap: Developing the next generation of STEM talent However, with the proliferation of blockchain initiatives comes a unique need for a diverse range of skills, including engineering, app development,Â cyber security and decentralised governance, to name just a few.

As such, there is a lot to choose from, with major organisations like Amazon, Oracle and Baidu all offering blockchain services. For CTOs trying to weigh the pros and cons of each of these providers \u2013 and if the wisdom of the crowd means anything \u2013 a recent study by the consultancy firm,Â Juniper Research, may be worth looking at. They surveyed close to 400 company founders, executives, managers and IT leaders, and identified IBM, Microsoft and Accenture as clear leaders in blockchain solutions.

Codementor.io New-collar workers Given how blockchain is an emerging technology, it is somewhat self-evident why relevant skills are hard to source. However, despite the complexity of blockchain, depending on what an organisation wants from this type of technology, you may not necessarily need people with degrees from the top universities. Sometimes all that is required is a little bit of training. >See also:Â Prioritising skills in the digital age Jobs of this sort of often referred to as \u201cnew-collar careers\u201d. A new-collar worker is an employee who develops the core soft skills required to fulfilÂ a role through means outside of traditional education. The term was coined by IBM\u2019s CEO, Ginni Rometty, in relation to \u201cmiddle-skill\u201d occupations in technology, such as cyber security analysts, application developers and cloud computing specialists. According to Rometty,Â speaking on CNBC: \u201cFor the future, there are many jobs that can be done without a four-year degree. In some of our centres in the United States around a third of our folks don\u2019t have four-year degrees.\u201d >See also:Â Should IT recruit attitude rather than skills? I think this sounds like an interesting option for very evident reasons, in that as the IT industry continues to evolve, it is critical to bring in young and diverse talent. However, if you are going to open your company to \u201cnew-collar workers\u201d, it is vital that you put in place a structure that will help them upskill and give them opportunities to contribute in fields like blockchain. In-house training schemes Some companies, like IBM, have taken this into account with their blockchain projects, and perhaps their strategies can be an example for all CTOs.IBM, who is recognised as a leading blockchain vendor, have used an in-house training scheme to attract and retain talent. The company also has an internal blockchain community boasting more than 5,000 active members. >See also:Â Breaking down training barriers with technology An interesting part of this initiative is how it offers certificates, so employees can then display theirÂ skillsÂ on their resumes or LinkedIn profiles.I think this is an important feature which not only encourages participation by way of offering recognition; it also helps IBM understand the type of skills they have. >See also:Â 5 benefits of using webinars to train new employees According to theÂ Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, UK employers are spending less on training than other major EU economies. Although this statistic doesn\u2019t relate solely to blockchain, it does point to a basic attitude problem when we think about the skills gap.CTOs should look into how they can upskill their existing staff. This means they should consider educational platforms that can help, and they should remember that education doesn\u2019t end in the classroom. Make blockchain open While universities across the world create thousands of courses, fustratingly, graduates still struggle to link their degrees to careers. For example, in the UKÂ 11.7% of computer science graduates spend six months unemployedÂ after completing their degrees, despite the huge demand for them. I think this points to a good reason for why CTOs and recruiters need to rethink how they currently engage with educational institutes. Hope may be on the horizon with the recent launch of the Institute of Coding.Â With funding from the UK Government\u2019sÂ Higher Education Funding Council for EnglandÂ and elsewhere, the IoC, led by theÂ University of Bath, aims to bring together a consortium of more than 60 universities, national and international corporations, SMEs, industry groups and experts in non-traditional learning professional bodies to bridge the divide.Information Age recently spoke with their director, Dr Rachid Hourizi,Â who explained how CTO\u2019s can work with them to develop the type of teams they need.Â  He said: \u201cWe are keen to develop new courses, so if you\u2019re a CTO of a company and you just can\u2019t get the kind of educated staff you need, or there are soft skills that are not being developed, we are enthusiastic to hear about how we can help.\u201d >See also:Â Interview with Dr Rachid Hourizi, Director of the Institute of CodingIn relation to blockchain, I also spoke with Professor John Domingue, Director of the Knowledge Media Institute at the Open University, who is currently working with IoC to better link blockchain education to the needs of industries.

Very early on, I realized that finding top professionals for this exciting, yet uncertain, space was going to require more than just an average hiring rubric, and assembling an efficient and collaborative team was going to require careful due diligence and thoughtful consideration. I liken it to what\u2019s known as a \u201cGreenfield Site,\u201d where we have a unique opportunity to build out a company from the ground up \u2014 complete with candidates from myriad practice areas and varying levels of experience. Instead of marching ahead with a traditional hiring strategy, I first asked myself: How can you effectively hire for an industry that\u2019s just beginning to formalize its policies, and what job-specific skills do you look for in potential candidates that have never heard of blockchain? Over the past year, with the help of two top-notch technical recruiters, my team has hired 78 industry professionals, with 40 hired in the past three months. While this is certainly fast-paced growth, it\u2019s not unprecedented. In fact, there has been aÂ 320Â percent growth in the number of blockchain jobs offered on popular hiring sites in the past 12 months, with aÂ 52Â percent increase in blockchain-related job searches from June to November 2017 alone. The industry as we know it is changing, and companies are looking for bright, engaged, professionals from an array of different industries and career stages to provide their expertise. The following is a brief overview of my experiences, as well as my take on how other blockchain companies can compile an expert team in the most exciting and innovative field since the dawn of the internet. Finding candidates This past year has been overwhelmingly referred to as the \u201cgolden year of blockchain.\u201d What was once an industry comprised of small-scale startups with largely unstructured teams has since flourished into a global industry with a current market capitalization of $269 billion. This is certainly promising news for the future of blockchain, but for HR professionals it means hiring top talent is surprisingly difficult. And that means it\u2019s difficult to scale. With rapid fluctuations in the space due to hyper-expansion and regulatory formalization, it\u2019s becoming harder to ensure that prospective candidates have the necessary experience to understand the shifting requirements.In setting substantive recruiting expectations, I recommend starting from a standpoint of company culture and engagement. Does this candidate fully understand the current climate surrounding the blockchain industry, or, perhaps more importantly, do they understand the mission of the company? Do they have any relevant experience in the blockchain industry? And, if not, how has their prior experience prepared them to take on this upcoming role? These are some of the first questions I\u2019ll ask in any interview.As the industry begins to gain mainstream momentum, hiring top candidates with blockchain expertise will become less of a rarity. However, for the time being, finding individuals with a deep-seated understanding of the company\u2019s mission, as well as a demonstrated interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency, is a far more achievable metric. As with any team, there\u2019s certainly a learning curve, and rejecting candidates simply for their lack of experience could result in losing highly-qualified individuals. Building a team For most HR departments, building out a team is a formulaic process. Managers hire their direct reports with approval from senior executives. This is certainly true for blockchain companies. However, as startups begin to transition into fully-realized companies, new positions become necessary that might not have been pertinent six months ago. Service providers with soft skills, particularly in the communications, legal, and marketing practice areas, are excellent examples of this. Of course, key skills needed as a startup may no longer be required for the next phase of growth so companies have tough decisions to make. In anticipation of new positions, in new departments, in new regions of the world, HR professionals should set up a precautionary hiring policy that establishes where incoming service providers will fit into the overall company structure. Similarly, as blockchain companies continue to expand, HR professionals will need to ensure that internal protocols, including onboarding, performance reviews, and training programs, grow to meet the heightened demand. Regardless of size or scale, every incoming person should feel adequately prepared for their given position and understand the requirements expected of them. This cannot be overstated. Fostering a future Without a crystal ball, it\u2019s impossible to accurately predict what the future will hold for blockchain. The industry is on an unprecedented trajectory, the likes of which even the most optimistic crypto experts could not have anticipated. For HR professionals, this ambiguity can present itself as a daunting and intimidating process. However, I urge you to think of it more as an opportunity \u2014 to use this \u201cGreenfield Site\u201d to find top talent, create a team of experts in their field from around the globe, and foster the next generation of crypto specialists. At my company, for example, we are working with education and research programs \u2014 establishing the Blockchain Technology Laboratory at the University of Edinburgh, establishing an Input Output Cryptocurrency Collaborative Research Chair within the Tokyo Tech School of Computing, and providing the \u2018Haskell & Cryptocurrency\u2019 course to students in Athens, Barbados, and soon in Ethiopia. This lets us take our candidate search directly to the classroom, informing students about the promise of blockchain and inspiring them to solve real-world problems in this space. The goal of our training courses is to extend the computer science training of participants and introduce them to Haskell, an elegant functional programming language, in the context of the cryptocurrency industry. At the end of each course, students are given the opportunity to apply for positions and continue their professional career in Haskell. Through education programs like these, we have a unique opportunity to reach an untapped pool of global candidates, as well as to inform and inspire their future relationship with blockchain. As HR professionals in the most fast-paced industry in the world, it\u2019s our shared duty to find and cultivate collaborative teams, as well as to create an environment conducive to their long-term success. Amid such rapid expansion, it can be easy to lose sight of the qualities that make an effective team member. However, with a clear vision, careful planning, and an acute attention to detail, not only can we turn once lofty ambitions into a concrete plan of action, but we can find top talent in a variety of industries to help us along the way.

(modernconsensus.com) Modern Consensus was on the ground in Berlin forÂ BlockShow, a two-day festival boasting thousands of attendees, each one there to expand their understanding of blockchain technology and meet some A-list crypto-players.Between the public on-stage panels and the private conversations we had with attendees, one theme cropped up consistently: it\u2019s hard to acquire the talent and human resources necessary to take a large or small company into the new blockchain-enabled future. We know the song all the crypto-kids sing: blockchain technology isn\u2019t just about powering bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s a \u201cnew internet\u201d setting a higher standard for how information moves and is validated around the world. This stuff isn\u2019t even ten years old yet; this new internet is in its dial-up phase. But that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t wisened experts out there. Most of them just happen to be too busy to go to work on someone else\u2019s project. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to recruit top blockchain talent at the moment because most experts prefer to do their own ICO, or set up a consultancy to better leverage their knowledge and share it with a series of clients,\u201d said Antoine Verdon, founder of Swiss blockchain company Proxeus. In simplest terms, the blockchain\u2019s existing pros mostly want to work for themselves. This sentiment is backed up by Marc P. Bernegger, a member of the \u201cblockchain task force\u201d that advises the Swiss economics minister on all things crypto. \u201cSome of the smartest blockchain people have been in the space for quite a long time and became financially independent from their digital asset holdings,\u201d he said. \u201cThey get to do just what they want, and are not forced to work for others because of money. \u201dThis situation is bound to change. As blockchain technology goes more mainstream, there will be an influx of widespread public interest (beyond all-caps \u201cbitcoin\u201d headlines) and savvy workers ready to handle crypto tasks. \u201cWe will hopefully see emergent products that reduce the technical hurdles to harness blockchain, and let employees focus on improving and carrying out business processes,\u201d said Verdon. His comment can be interpreted as a subtle plug for his companyÂ Proxeus, which provides companies with a figurative blockchain toolbox (it\u2019s been called \u201cWordPress for blockchain\u201d in the past), letting people with no technical expertise quickly and easily create their own blockchain applications. In any event, today\u2019s pool of young computer programmers will likely shift their attention to the blockchain space, bringing all their existing expertise with them as they begin to specialize in this \u201cnew normal. \u201dTo any company looking to hire blockchain specialists, Bernegger and Verdon offer the following advice: look for people who have actually built blockchain solutions that solve real problems, then ask them to detail their solution step by step. \u201cThanks to tools like GitHub, you have far better opportunity to test the skills and the knowledge of today\u2019s tech people compared to ten years ago, and the talent pool is truly becoming global,\u201d said Bernegger. \u201cI think smart people focusing on blockchain have a very bright future.\u201d Dylan Love is an editorial consultant, contributing reporter, and fiendishly curious technology enthusiast.

But a new wave of young people is eager to get formed. By now, the best option is probably to deal with specialists who are already working on real blockchain solutions to get things done while training new specialists for future projects. 10 1 vote Reply Jun 6, 2018"
