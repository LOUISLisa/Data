I\u2019m facing a reality that I can\u2019t avoid anymore: I\u2019m angry. I\u2019m angry at everything. I\u2019m angry at the world, and at the people that live in it. I\u2019ve always been grumpy. People have told me I\u2019m intimidating and, as I grew tired of people being afraid of me, I\u2019ve been trying to become a better and more approachable person. I like to believe I was successful. I learned to be there for people when they needed it. I tried to be caring, compassionate, capable, and available. For the most part, I did it. But now, I\u2019m angry. I\u2019ve had my rodeos with police abuse, both through friends and directed at me. Some people I know were forcefully disappeared during some protests last week and now I can\u2019t manage to keep my cool at any given time anymore. I feel like all I\u2019ve done has been for nothing. I want to go out to throw stones at windows and burn everything. I can\u2019t take it anymore, and all my therapist said when trying to work through my encounters with the police was something along the lines of \u201cbut they\u2019re not allowed to do that! You should have spoken up and stood up for your rights.\u201d Yeah. Okay.Â Â  My gay friends are angry, my straight friends don\u2019t get me, and I\u2019ve started to concern some of them because of my increasingly explosive behavior. So please, tell me, Papi, how do I manage? How do I stay supportive and caring when I feel like a hungry hyena who only wants to go into the fight to see how many bites it can get out of the lion before it gets mauled to death? Signed, Bloodthirsty NB. Hey there, BNB! Goodness, looks like I\u2019m going to be yet another entity addressing These Uncertain Timesâ¢. For the record, I don\u2019t believe in Certain Timesâ¢. I have never lived in a time where anything was certain. But there are certainly degrees of uncertainty, and we do find ourselves in some of the least certain of all. RHOMBUS. Were you expecting that? Of course you weren\u2019t. Such is the chaos of our unpredictable age. Anything could happen at any time. Stay vigilant. Moving on. I regrettably have nothing on tap that will make you less angry, BNB. To pay even the slightest bit of attention right now is to be angry. You think I\u2019m going to sit here and tell you not to be angry? No. You should be. You have every right. More people should be angry, in fact.Â  That being said, what you and I call \u201canger\u201d is actually at least a hundred thousand different emotional cocktails with different iterations and expressions. There is righteous anger, jealous anger, anger at yourself, and anger with the world. Anger can bring a mighty institution to its knees, or it can eat you alive from the inside until there\u2019s nothing left. It can even do both at the same time. So instead of talking about \u201canger\u201d as if it were this pure universal element, why don\u2019t we talk about your anger, which I think you\u2019ve articulated in an interesting way. For example, you position it to be in conflict with being a good person. In your letter, anger is on the other side of being \u201ccaring, compassionate, capable, and available.\u201d I have to wonder why that is, because I think anger can actually be a bridge that brings people together for collective action. It can fuel movements, it can right wrongs, and it can invite others to gain insight into our sentiments. Making people uncomfortable for a good cause is one thing. Feeling like you\u2019re losing your compassion is another. The thing is, BNB, you don\u2019t need to be \u201capproachable.\u201d That sounds coded to me, and it\u2019s long been the case, especially for Black people (I don\u2019t know what your situation is), that \u201cangry\u201d and \u201cunapproachable\u201d have been deployed where \u201cadvocates for themselves\u201d or \u201crefuses to be bossed around\u201d are more accurate descriptions.Â  Share What you do need, though, is to be right with yourself. I know what it\u2019s like to feel anger that doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go. I know what it feels like for anger to fester into rage, rage into bitterness, and bitterness into misery: Why can\u2019t the world be fair? Why aren\u2019t I treated better? Why am I trapped in such a cold, cruel reality?Â  And worst of all, BNB? The ugliest thing nestled in the ugliest place of that ugly, knotted root is the unsettling fact that, well, the bitterness is kind of correct. We do live in an unfair world. We aren\u2019t always or even usually treated well. This can be a cold, cruel reality. I\u2019ve thought, and thought, and thought about this, and I never come up with a substantive enough rebuttal to do away with the bitterness entirely. Lucky for us, though, multiple things can be true. Things can be bad, and they can be good. We can be angry and useful, angry and productive, angry and righteous. I think anger is like lightning, BNB. You can be a conductor and let it travel through you, let it galvanize and energize, or you can let it burn you to a crisp. Letting it burn you to a crisp doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wrong. You can be angry for all the right reasons, and in the end, still be a very correct crisp. So, what do we do about that, BNB? Here\u2019s what I do. I think about all the people who would be justified in being angry with me. Our world isn\u2019t cleanly assembled into oppressed and oppressors. It\u2019s solipsistic, vanity, even, for me to get so frustrated with a world that won\u2019t just be better when I myself have so much work to do in being better. I am part of the world too.Â  I have my part to play. We all do. We should try our best to do what\u2019s right\u2014for people we don\u2019t know, for people who have every reason in the world to be angry with us for dragging our feet. We aren\u2019t perfect. But we can try. And that\u2019s about all we can ask of ourselves and others. Now, that\u2019s not to flatten everything out. There are degrees to this shit, BNB, and some people are just\u2026 well, objectively worse. It\u2019s hard not to think that way, seeing police brutality and people laughing at others\u2019 pain. But I, for one, don\u2019t want to let this hell world flambe my insides. So I have my support groups, and I have my actions I take, and I try to let love keep me going every chance I get. That can look like a protest, or a donation, or being there for someone we love who needs us. On that note, here are some causes I\u2019ll be supporting in honor of your letter. Yes, yours, BNB! And I would invite anyone reading this to do the same. Here\u2019s a link to the Okra Project, and here\u2019s another to the Marsha P. Johnson Institute.Â  We need you, BNB. We need your compassion, and we need your joy, and, yes, we need your anger.
