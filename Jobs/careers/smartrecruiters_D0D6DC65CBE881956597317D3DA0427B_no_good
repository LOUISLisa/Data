See Erika\u2019s other posts RenÃ© Bolier If you are in recruitment in any way, shape or form, I highly recommend you to read the Definitive Guide to Hiring Success which was recently released by SmartRecruiters. I especially enjoyed the sections about measuring hiring success and how to organize a recruitment team effectively (learning from sales environments). See RenÃ©\u2019s other posts Lisa-Marie Smith I was lucky enough to sit in and hear all about this launch at my recent visit to SmartRecruiters HQ in San Francisco! Incredible thought leadership from Jerome Ternynck and the SmartRecruiters team. Congratulations to all involved! #hiringsuccess #talentacquistion #insights #thoughtleadership #HR #recruitent #technologyleaders See Lisa-Marie\u2019s other posts Stanislaw Wasowicz Love how SmartRecruiters is shifting the industry\u2019s paradigm to look at the right metrics! This one is very much related to good forecasting. That\u2019s why (\u2018Did someone say forecasting?\u2019) Danny, Kraig and their Foresight tech would be a great fit for the SmartRecruiters marketplace.
