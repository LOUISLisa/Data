According to figures provided to CoinDesk from one of the largest jobs sites, Indeed.com, searches for roles involving bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency dropped by 3.06 percent from October 2017 to October 2018 (blue line on graph below). Meanwhile, employer interest in such jobs \u2013 that is, the number of job postings \u2013 increased by 25.49 percent over the same period (red line on graph). The statistics paint a \u201cvery different\u201d picture than that seen last year, Indeed said. In the year from October 2016 to October 2017, job seeker interest rose by 481.61 percent, while employer interest increased by 325 percent. Raj Mukherjee, Indeed\u2019s senior vice president of product, told CoinDesk: \u201cWhile over the last few years Indeed saw a steady rise in job seeker interest for roles related to cryptocurrency, our data shows that job searches for these roles really picked up around the time when the cost of bitcoin was at its highest. Since then job seeker interest has gone down, but still remains strong.\u201d A different report from job portal Glassdoor, published last month, indicated a 300-percent increase in blockchain-related job openings in the U.S. after comparing the month of August this year and last. The median salary also rose by 61.8 percent to $84,884 per year for blockchain-related jobs, it said. Job seekers image via Shutterstock????????????
