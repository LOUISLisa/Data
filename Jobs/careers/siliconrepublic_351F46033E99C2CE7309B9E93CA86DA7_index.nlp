Silkstock/Stock.adobe.com 75pc of Irish people would not consider a career in blockchain by Eva Short 15 Nov 2018457 Views New research published by blockchain professional services firm Wachsman has found as many as three in four Irish people would not consider a career in blockchain. Would you consider a career in blockchain? Statistically, it\u2019s unlikely you would. At least, that is according to new research published by blockchain professional services firm Wachsman????????????which concludes that as many as 75pc of Irish people would not wade into the industry. The research, which sought to investigate the attitudes towards and knowledge of blockchain among Irish people, cites a general lack of understanding as the primary factor. More than half (53pc) of those surveyed say they do not understand what blockchain technology is. Those surveyed also cite lack of information (38pc) and unsuitable educational backgrounds (10pc) as barriers to entry. Of the 1,000 respondents in Ireland, those between the ages of 25 and 34 were most likely to want to pursue a career in blockchain at 38pc. The study further noted a gender disparity in the responses, with women (20pc) less likely to be interested than men (30pc). Of those who would not consider a career in blockchain, women were more likely than men to say that they do not know what blockchain technology is \u2013 61pc, in fact, compared to 44pc of men. The gulf of understanding increases with age, the survey further found. Those aged between 45 and 54 were most likely (62pc) to say they do not know what blockchain is, followed by those aged 55 to 64 (54pc). Hiring Now Excellence in research for innovation and analytics Improve business performance through data and insights Helping people and teams focus on the work that matters Building relationships, creating value \u201cThe findings of this study are remarkable,\u201d commented Wachsman CEO and founder David Wachsman. \u201cIreland boasts one of the most highly skilled and educated workforces in the world, yet most Irish people would not consider a career in blockchain because they don\u2019t feel they have the \u2018right\u2019 background. \u201cWhile blockchain is a new technology, the concepts, use cases and applications for implementation can be learned. The quality and quantity of research materials, educational guides and news coverage on blockchain usage \u2014 all the way from start-ups to blue chip enterprises \u2014 are increasing by the day.\u201d Wachsman added: \u201cWith demand for blockchain technology experts skyrocketing both in Ireland and abroad, it\u2019s important for people to realise that a career in blockchain stretches far beyond requiring a computer science, business or finance degree. Industry newcomers in Ireland can be professionally trained and educated on the disruptive power and potential of blockchain because it is quickly becoming among the most significant career opportunities of our generation.\u201d Blockchain uses maths and cryptography to provide an open, decentralised database, or record of any transaction involving value \u2013 this is often also known as a digital ledger. It is best known as the technology that enables cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum to be safely traded without going through a third-party such as a bank. Though its applications have for a long time been primarily financial, an increasing number of uses for the peer-to-peer technology are being discovered as understanding of blockchain deepens. Blockchain has been proposed as the future of voting, of storing electronic health records, of providing identification and more.
