Abigail will talk to us about how to build a subscriber audience when you don\u2019t already have one. Abigail started This Needs Hot Sauce in 2017 with a simple Instagram story. She didn\u2019t have an existing email list or significant following on another social platform. Since then, Abigail has changed careers by leveraging her newsletter, adding paid subscriptions, and more. The workshop will run next Thursday, July 9th, starting at 11am PT (UTC-7). All workshops are free to attend, and there will be plenty of opportunity to ask questions.
