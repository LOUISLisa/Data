In this case I can help you with it. I already made multiple airdrops for many high value Tokens. My experience helps me to make this expensive task as cheap (gas wise) as somehow possible for you. If you buy this gig I only need the list of addresses you plan to send the Tokens to. Please note that you need to start the transactions to send the Tokens out yourself so I never need access to the airdrop tokens myself. The final transaction can be done from any wallet even MyEtherWallet.
