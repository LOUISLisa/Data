We need the right people to help us realize that vision. What we\u2019ll accomplish together: Develop effective infrastructure for our projects to deploy onto, ensuring projects are scalable, resilient, and reliable in support of growing products. Iterate on processes to improve our ability to ship fast while maintaining high quality systems that we can depend on. Enhance tools and automation to fill the gaps in our current systems as well as build entirely new ones as we face bigger and more complex challenges.
