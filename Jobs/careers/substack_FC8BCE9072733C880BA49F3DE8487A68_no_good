I broke up with my girlfriend six months ago and still get angry whenever her name comes up. I\u2019ve done everything I can think of to move past it, and none of it has worked. I\u2019m just as furious as ever. If not more! She was my first girlfriend. We were together for a little less than a year, but it felt like way longer because it was suffocating. She expressed jealousy two weeks after we met. She demanded my time and had no respect for my space. She had opinions on my body hair, intruded on my relationship with my homophobic, abusive mother, and made me feel like I wasn\u2019t capable of love because I didn\u2019t show it the same way she did. Worst of all, she felt entitled to my body and often emotionally coerced me into having sex. I could complain about her for hours, but that\u2019s in my journal. Right now, I just want to let all this go and forget she exists. I like someone new, a lot. She\u2019s basically all I think about and I'm excited to see where things go. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that I have no residual feelings for my ex. Feelings of wanting to push her off a cliff, maybe.Â  But how do I get rid of this anger? I just want to forget all about it and not give her any space in my brain because she doesn\u2019t deserve it. What should I do? Sincerely, Angry Lesbian Hey there, AL! That sounds like a bad relationship. I\u2019m glad you got out of it! You should be proud of yourself. But isn\u2019t it frustrating how getting out of a relationship doesn\u2019t always mean getting out of the way it made you feel?Â  Sometimes the mere thought of a person from 2011 will ruin my day, AL. It feels very unfair. It makes me think, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you have been buried alongside the other relics of your time, like Glee and that one Taio Cruz song none of us could escape? Leave me alone.\u201d So I do have some experience in what you\u2019re dealing with and I think I can help. That\u2019s good, because I guess that\u2019s why you\u2019re here. No one ever comes here just to chat or ask about my day. Everyone has a crisis and I have to try to stamp it out with my big digital foot. Well we all have our parts to play I guess. OK here I go with the helping, hear me out on this. Have you ever wanted something you can\u2019t possibly have? I do all the time! Right now, I wish I was sitting in a coffee shop, or in my husband\u2019s house. But everything is closed and I don\u2019t have a husband or even a boyfriend who is a pastry chef (if you\u2019re reading this PLEASE reach out). I can\u2019t conjure those realities either, because I\u2019m not a warlock or whatever entity can do that kind of thing. That\u2019s fine, because I have accepted the fact that those action items are not plausible, nor are they within my purview. Acceptance has brought my desires and my realities into peaceful coalition. But, here\u2019s where things have the potential to get tricky: What if I felt, for one reason or another, that I could and should be able to make those things happen? When what we want falls into irreconcilable conflict with what we can reasonably attain, frustration and bitterness tend to flourish. This is because the gap between our two realities, the one we\u2019d like to inhabit and the one we actually live in, can\u2019t actually be bridged, no matter how much time and effort we pour into the gulf.Â  I offer you this, AL, with the hope that you can accept it: You can\u2019t forget this person or erase her from your life. Indeed, the more you try to forget her, the more you will actually be thinking of her. Our experiences collapse into our identities, and whether big or small, the impact they make is here to stay.Â  However, acknowledging the pain someone left us is not the same as excusing it, nor should we confuse their influence on our lives for the person themselves. In other words, the hurt you\u2019re grappling with, the ways she made you feel small or weak or taken advantage of, is not literally her living in your brain. She\u2019s not here. You left her behind, for the better. She doesn\u2019t have the power to live in your head. It\u2019s your own thoughts, feelings, and emotions in there, and while that can feel frustrating and painful, it does mean you have the agency and power to deal with them. You don\u2019t need to forget she existed. You need to process your experiences in a way that will help you move on. We are not defined by the people who\u2019ve hurt us. We are defined by our response to the hurt.Â  Share I wish I could tell you this is the last time you\u2019ll be injured by someone, AL, but knowing life as I do, it probably won\u2019t be. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important not to live your life hoping you\u2019ll miraculously avoid the bumps and bruises of the \u201cOther People\u201d obstacle course. It\u2019s more prudent, I think, to live with the expectation that difficult times will happen, and we ought to give ourselves the tools we need to overcome them so that we can enjoy the good things. That was the point of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I think. Well, there are worse things I could plagiarize. And I have.
