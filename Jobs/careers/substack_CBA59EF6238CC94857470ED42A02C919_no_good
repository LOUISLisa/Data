While my high school was majority Latinx, in the classes I took I was usually the only person of color. I'm a Latino who can understand Spanish but has a crap accent when speaking it. My family's socioeconomic status made me feel like an outsider to the white kids who could afford to do extravagant things after school. Taking advanced classes, I became friends with the white people around me, but my melanin made me feel like I could never truly fit in.Â  I joined advanced classes late because I was forced into ESL classes. I felt like I was catching up with the white kids who had been in those classes the whole time. These kids looked down on me when I didn't know as much as them. Even when I finally caught up to them they would either insult me or ignore the fact that I was there. At a certain point, I tried channeling these negative emotions into anger to fuel myself to become better. Every single time I beat them in a test or quiz or anything graded I knew that I deserved to be there. I ended high school this year ranking above most of my peers and am even going to one of the top 20 universities in the country. My problem is I don\u2019t think I will be able to continue like this. Deep down, I know I deserve my spot at the university, but I've heard from so many people that I only got in because of Affirmative Action that I'm starting to be convinced. My future peers will be just as smart as I am, but with more accomplishments. I don\u2019t know if I can continue using my grades as a way to handle my problems. And even if it works in college, it won't work in the real world. I don\u2019t feel like I'm good enough to be where I\u2019m at. I know comparing myself to others is not what I should be doing, but what can I do? Signed, ImposterÂ  Hi there, Imposter! My mom was my high school English teacher my freshman year. This was fine, albeit embarrassing at times (she was much more popular than I was), but then I made the mistake of being good at writing.Â  I won some essay contests and started getting attention for it. My name was even on the after-school announcements! Pretty sick. Then, when college application season came around, I landed a big one: I got into Duke. That was a huge deal in my neck of the woods. Not Ivy League or anything, but, well, I still don\u2019t know what that term even means. All throughout that experience, beginning to end, there was this pernicious rumor that my mom was writing everything for me, and then, when I got into a \u201cgood school,\u201d that I had only gotten in because I was \u201ca Mexican.\u201d Joke\u2019s on them, huh? My mom is still writing everything, including this column, and I\u2019m still reaping all the benefits of being a Mexican, like this absolute dump truck culo. Kidding, kidding, es broma. Not every Mexican has that, of course. But I do. Point is, every accomplishment I made, every inch of progress I took, there was always someone waiting in the wings to cast doubt on it. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, because I\u2019ve tried overcompensating too. I realized early on that I would have to be better than good. I would have to be great. I would have to be so great that surely no one would ever look at me and think, \u201che\u2019s not the real deal.\u201d But over time and after much exhaustion, Imposter, I realized something: I was trying to beat someone else\u2019s game, and that game had absolutely zero interest in me as a person. I was trying to drink from a mirage: that elite institutions were in any way qualified to assess my worth, that being \u201cas white\u201d as the white kids was going to do a damn thing for me, that the systems I\u2019d been plopped into could meaningfully reward me. I know what I\u2019m supposed to say here, Imposter. I\u2019m supposed to say, \u201cthink like a straight white guy.\u201d Carry yourself with his confidence, tackle things like he would tackle them, believe in yourself like he believes in himself. And, sure. I think there are some benefits to dabbling in that. But on the whole, it\u2019s never really worked for me, and here\u2019s why. For one, I\u2019m simply not a straight white man and I don\u2019t think putting myself in the mindset of one is going to cure my imposter syndrome. That sounds like adding another layer of fraud, if anything. For two, I simply don\u2019t think the typical \u201cstraight white man\u201d is even \u201cconfident,\u201d per se. I just think he, more so than others, probably hasn\u2019t run into the same obstacles. That\u2019s not confidence. That\u2019s reckless, unearned optimism.Â  Share I have more of these! For three: I would rather not think or act like a person who would do well in this heinous system, be they white or male or anything else. It\u2019s a mindset, not an identity, and I think that mindset has wrought havoc on the delicate balance of this world Ã  la Fire Lord Ozai in Avatar. There\u2019s a topical reference for you. I watch TV shows. For four! I have this theory that under capitalism, we\u2019re all imposters and the people we see as competent have merely made peace with the reality that you can\u2019t bring your whole self, your compassion, your gentleness, your humanity, into the fighting pit. So often, people are rewarded for prioritizing profits at the expense of others with less power. I don\u2019t think any of us should be aiming for that, even if we\u2019d be the first queer brown person in any given institution to do it. \u201cBut!\u201d You shriek at me, noticing the weakness in my otherwise perfect, possibly award-winning screed. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily what confidence is! When we say \u2018think like a white man,\u2019 we don\u2019t mean become him. We just mean you should doubt yourself less.\u201d And you know what? I agree. Here\u2019s what I want for you, Imposter. I want you to stop privileging your critics in the deliberation room in your head. I want you to feel competent, worthy, and comfortable. I want you to walk into a room and, even if it\u2019s full of faces that look nothing like yours, know that you belong there. I just think that, to get there, you have to throw away this mindset that arranges humans into hierarchies. I want you to stop thinking about being good enough for this university. This university is lucky to have you. You should be thinking about what it can do for you instead, about what tools it can provide you with to build the life and the kind of world you want to live in. And when you think of that world, Imposter, I hope you can imagine one beyond the one we\u2019re in, where the only difference is that you\u2019re closer to the top of it. I hope you imagine one where you\u2019re not just, essentially, a brown white dude, but one where you\u2019re in community with the people that are pushed to the bottom in the process of configuring society into a pyramid.Â  A lot of life is performance. A lot of life is having to put on a certain face, entering a room, and showing off the parts of you that will get rewarded while minimizing the parts that, for one reason or another, get punished. That\u2019s reality. You\u2019re not fake for having to do that. I just hope that, when they let you through into the next room, you make sure to leave the door behind you wide open.
