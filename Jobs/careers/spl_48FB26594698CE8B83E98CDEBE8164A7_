E-commerce is a $1.95T Industry Today E-commerce is broken as the top four players make up over 63% of the market Amazon alone controls 49% of the market which means they can increase costs or censor sellers with no resource Amazon is Taking Money Out of your Pocket Amazon takes up to 40% of seller\u2019s revenue Amazon will hit $250B of e-commerce revenue in 2018 Of that 68% or $176B is generated from third party sales STOP PAYING EXORBITANT MIDDLEMAN FEES WITH SPL.YT Earn back your revenue with Spl.yt Spl.yt creates a competitive network by unifying the all other e-commerce players Spl.yt provides an alternative platform from the big players with no platform fees Challenges of E-commerce Today Reputation, Spam, & Fraud Reputation systems are needed to build trust for online transactions; however, they do not follow you from platform to platform, and central entities can censor ratings and exploit users for more money or risk unfair representation. Dependency on Intermediaries E-commerce is riddled with inefficiencies caused by middlemen and intermediary services that take out a large percentage of profits on each transaction. Asymmetric Data & Inventories Buyers are forced to compare and contrast the same product on different websites searching for the best deal, while inventory management across multiple vendors and systems causes accounting errors. Introducing the Spl.yt Protocol Spl.yt is a smart contract infrastructure that supports the foundation of a more efficient, transparent, and secure e-commerce ecosystem. BLOCKCHAIN AND SMART CONTRACTS Spl.yt\u2019s blockchain-backed smart contract protocol automatically performs and records e-commerce middleman functions, reducing the overall cost of transactions and ensuring the immutability of data broadcasted to the blockchain. SPL.YT ACCESS TOKEN The Spl.yt Access Token, or SAT, is a crypto-asset that can be used to meet many unique user needs. For example, SATs promote accurate, trustworthy transactions by requiring deposits and incentivizing credibility validators. SATs are also used for in-protocol dispute resolution, and to decrease volatility outside of their control.
