Candidate pools help you to manage, organize & nurture relationships with candidates who are not necessarily affiliated with a specific role. They're a simple way to manage the full candidate funnel, while making sure you always have great talent in the pipeline for future roles. What's an Active Position or Candidate Pool? For a position, being active means being listed on your public Career Portal and distribution to our 3rd party job boards. Essentially, when candidates are able to apply to it. For both Candidate Pool and Positions, being active allows you to communicate with candidates; exchanging emails, scheduling interviews, etc. Where have you been all my life?
