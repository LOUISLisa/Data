While we are seeing many people already cautioning about the destruction of millions of jobs, is good to hear someone who is already looking ahead to a world where also millions of new jobs and positions are going to be created, in a new paradigm. Humans are resilient and adapt to any landscape and situation, so we are optimistic that new generations will be up to the challenge. 10 1 vote Reply Jan 28, 2019"
