Using Substack in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use Substack.

Terminating Your Account Substack is free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of Substack, or your account, for any reason at our discretion. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important Posts you may have uploaded to your account, but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone\u2019s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Substack. Substack also allows you to delete your account at any time. When you delete your account, any Posts associated with that account will also be deleted. However, any Post that you have made public may remain available.Â  You understand and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete your content from Substack\u2019s records or backups, and that your Posts may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or stored by other users.Â Please refer to our Privacy Policy to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using Substack.Â  You agree that some of the obligations in these Terms will be in force even after you terminate your account.Â All of the following terms will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, terms regarding disputes between us, and any other terms that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms. If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at tos@substackinc.com \u2013 we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can\u2019t promise that we can recover or restore anything.

We\u2019ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to Substack that would adversely affect you, but this isn\u2019t always possible or practical. Changes to the Terms We are constantly trying to improve our products and services, so these Terms may need to change along with Substack.Â  We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.Â  If you don\u2019t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use Substack.Â  If you use Substack in any way after a change to the Terms is effective and notice has been provided, that means you agree to all of the changes.Â  Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.Â  Violations of the Terms Failure to follow any of these Terms shall constitute a breach of these Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account.Â Substack has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.Â  Miscellaneous Terms The above covers most of the questions that we typically receive about Substack.
