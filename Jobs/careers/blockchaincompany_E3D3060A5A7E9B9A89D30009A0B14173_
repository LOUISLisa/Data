Their success has unparalleled with anything in the stratosphere, yet they\u2019re still receiving offers with compensation packages rivaling that of CEO pay packages. And many of them have already become millionaires from investing in the coins of the market leaders they helped to build, including bitcoin and Ethereum, which means they\u2019re less incentivized to join other projects for the size of the offer alone. // -- Discuss and ask questions in ourÂ community on Workplace. Decentralized World The thing to remember about blockchain pioneers is that they set out on the mission of a decentralized world not so that they could be subject to the whims of cryptocurrency prices. They are just as focused on the social impact of the blockchain as they are the success of their respective projects. Consider Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin, who during the peak of the cryptocurrency market rally at year-end 2017 tweeted the following reminder to his followers \u2013 *All* crypto communities, ethereum included, should heed these words of warning. Need to differentiate between getting hundreds of billions of dollars of digital paper wealth sloshing around and actually achieving something meaningful for society.Â  https://t.co/aNpEnBNGsA\u2014 Vitalik \"Not giving away ETH\" Buterin (@VitalikButerin)Â December 27, 2017 Buterin went on to use Venezuela as an example, whose economy is in tatters. He was dismayed that bitcoin\u2019s price posts were getting more traction than \u201chow Venezuelans were being rescued by crypto.\u201d // -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD.Â  Click here to change your current membership-- // If the corporate culture reflected Buterin\u2019s mission rather than dangling a six- or seven-digit compensation package in front of recruits, they might have more success attracting top blockchain talent. Talent Battle Meanwhile, blockchain startups are creating roadmaps with product release dates obligating them to have top development talent in-house, all of which is leading toÂ projects getting stuck and helping to fuel the hiring frenzy.Â It\u2019s not solely blockchain startups, however. Global corporations including certain FANG stocks are no longer waiting on the sidelines as ICOs raise billions of dollars and the cryptocurrency market cap has balloons to nearly $400 billion, all of which has placed a high bounty on the pool for blockchain talent. If you have any doubts, consider again Ethereum co-founder Buterin. As Hacked.comÂ previously reported, Buterin tweeted about having received a job offer from Google. David Schwartz,Â whose Twitter profileÂ describes him as \u201cone of the original architects of the XRP network,\u201dÂ told The Wall Street JournalÂ how both a startup and a big tech play attempted to poach one of his team members, each of them offering the Ripple developer a million dollar signing bonus. Meanwhile, the blockchain, a public immutable ledger where transactions are recorded and joined together in individual blocks, has become a catchphrase, one that can mean the difference between hits on a LinkedIn profile or not. According to theÂ JournalÂ story, there are thousands of available jobs posted on the social platform hunting blockchain talent through the early part of May, reflecting more than a 150% jump versus all of last year. But just as regulators have said they don\u2019t want to rush into crafting any policy in response to market performance, employers should similarly take a step back before throwing everything but kitchen sinks out to software developers. Some companies are developing talent in-house, which is another route to consider. But overall, hiring companies could be much more effective at recruitingÂ blockchain talent if they understood the mission behind decentralization. Featured image courtesy of Shutterstock.

As in any new technology, there is no yet enough people for these positions, so for a time they will get the benefits of being the ultra rare talents. Blockchain start ups need to ponder how to get them, either hiring them, or else, the most practical way now, by nurturing their in-house talents, or starting talent sandboxes . 10 1 vote Reply May 24, 2018"
