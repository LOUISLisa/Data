In the first five months of 2019, there were almost as many blockchain job listings as for all of 2018,Â TeQatlas research has shown. The company has analysed the data on open vacancies for blockchain-related positions, looking into disclosed salaries. It also provided the list of the top-15 blockchain employers, with IMB grabbing first place with 335 blockchain vacancies, followed by Oracle and pwc.Â The rise in blockchain job offerings is nothing new\u2014the number of blockchain-related positions has been growing consistently since the inception of blockchain.

With the growing number of open positions, disclosed salaries also present nicely. While the salaries range from $17k up to $271k per year, the majority of job offerings\u2014404 offerings\u2014place between $81k-$144k. Therefore, an average blockchain salary is more than double the U.S. average, equaling $105k annually as opposed to $49k.

Here are the 4 skills you'll need - Study Inte... (studyinternational.com) More businesses plan to use blockchain in future. AÂ surveyÂ by Big Four auditing firm KPMG found that 48 percent of C-level executives believeÂ blockchainÂ is likely to change the way they do business in the next three years, while 41 percent of respondents said they are likely to use the technology in their companies. For fresh graduates planning to venture into this hot sub-industry, the following information will come in useful. KPMG has recently released what it deems to be the top four skill sets for those planning a career in blockchain. Blockchain refers to the secure and transparent ledger behind technologies such as cryptocurrency. A vague term just a few years ago, the technology and its capabilities are now more understood by businesses. It\u2019s expanding business models, piloting projects and presenting new solutions to many companies. But to succeed, they require graduate talent. \u201cLike any emerging technology, having the right talent is paramount to driving results,\u201d the report states. \u201cBlockchain projects will not succeed or scale without a multifaceted team that goes beyond technologists. We expect more universities to integrate blockchain into future coursework, which will help prepare both end users as well as those who will be responsible for building, deploying and managing blockchain. \u201dAnd these talented individuals should possess these following skills: 1. Business acumen From IT to finance, procurement to mailroom, blockchain will have an impact on every organisational role. A person working in blockchain needs to understand a business deeply as the technology works in such a way that each entity has a unique view and access. Failing to do this will result in a blockchain project without a compelling use case. 2. Tech literacy Knowing the cloud, protocols, consensus, ERPs and networks aren\u2019t enough. Future blockchain employees should also know when to use different tools and platforms, as well as how blockchain interacts within an existing technology ecosystem and vice versa. Some knowledge of coding like JavaScript, HTML and Solidity will be important for those planning to work on the development side of blockchain, too. 3. Data analysis One of blockchain\u2019s greatest benefits is data. The report says the key to success lies in those who can understand and make use of this to be presented to a variety of people across the business. 4. Hacker mentality A blockchain worker must be open to explore and experiment by \u201chacking the problem\u201d from a business and technology perspective. This means working collaboratively in a workshop-type setting to think through the business objectives, implications and value story for each of the participants and then define the architecture and overall solution flow.

Blockchain start ups already know this and create teams which mix all these skills, to produce results. 10 1 vote Reply May 23, 2019 (edited) Jobs and Talent: These are the top skill sets for a successful blockchain team |... (computerworld.com) As undergraduates emerge from schools with software development or business skills, companies exploring blockchain use are seeking job candidates with four specific skill sets, according to a new report from consultancy KPMG. Those skills are needed more with each passing month; KPMG expects an increase in the number of companies exploring blockchain this year for everything from identifying new business models to piloting projects and ultimately, progressing to scalable solutions. KPMG said, not surprisingly, that it's seeking graduates with a solid grasp of blockchain at a high level \u2013 those who understand distributed ledgers, peer-to-peer topologies and consensus mechanisms; all are key for a technologist hoping to land a high-paying blockchain developer job. The nexus of tech and business acumen \"The key thing we do at KPMG is balance an understanding of how this technology works without being a blockchain hammer looking for a nail,\" said Tegan Keele, KPMG's U.S. blockchain program lead. \"You have to know how to apply it and that really only comes if you have an understanding of business processes. \"Secondly, members of a blockchain team should understand the difference between a variety of technologies, including the cloud, protocols, ERPs and networks, and know Â when to use different mechanisms and platforms. \"This will help ensure they can understand how blockchain interacts within an existing technology ecosystem, and how that ecosystem will impact the design of the blockchain solution,\" KPMG said. \"And for those who are planning to work on the development side of blockchain, some knowledge of coding (JavaScript, HTML, solidity, etc.) is helpful.... That means the company looks for blockchain developers with business acumen, such as a knowledge of supply chain or procurement systems or finance processes \u2013 skills that are already taught in undergraduate programs. BrandPostÂ Sponsored byÂ Fortinet In today's networked environments, the only certainty is change. It is imperative, therefore, that solutions are selected and designed with that in mind. KPMG also looks for a job candidate's technical literacy, or the ability to understand Â data generated on a blockchain platform and how to use it in a business context. One of the key attributes of blockchain is its ability to span an organization and its business partners, essentially connecting multiple, disparate entities through a single, transparent electronic ledger. \"But, then you have multiple people within each participating entity looking at the blockchain and they're all going to want to see slightly different things,\" Keele said. \"So understanding how to derive those insights out of the information on a blockchain is key.\" A hacker's ability to problem solve Those entering the blockchain development/engineering field should have the mentality of a hacker - or the ability to problem solve collaboratively in a workshop setting when a client presents a business problem. BrandPostÂ Sponsored byÂ NTT Communications They need to be able to think through the business objectives, implications and value \"for each of the participants and then [define] the architecture and overall solution flow,\" KPMG said. \"It is this collaborative approach that leads to a successful application of blockchain. \"Given the lack of coursework around blockchain and its relatively new existence in the enterprise, a team must be open to exploring and experimenting by \"hacking the problem\" from a business and IT perspective, according to KPMG. \"I'd say at KPMG we've been very successful at taking [employee] skills in-house and upscaling them to deliver blockchain skills,\" Keele said. \"Until universities start printing blockchain degrees, that will be the pattern that will continue. \"The list of U.S. universitiesÂ now offering coursesÂ on blockchain continues to grow and includes such prestigious institutions as MIT,Â Princeton,Â UC BerkeleyÂ andÂ Stanford University. The top blockchain jobs, according toÂ a report last year by BusinessStudent.com, are interns, project managers, developers, engineers, quality engineers, legal consultants or attorneys and web designers. While most techies who add blockchain to their skillset are versed in programming languages such as Java or Python, it's by no means a prerequisite for learning the technology. Like any emerging technology, having the right talent is paramount to driving results, KPMG's report said.\"Blockchain projects will not succeed or scale without a multifaceted team that goes beyond technologists,\" KPMG wrote. \"We expect more universities to integrate blockchain into future coursework, which will help prepare both end users as well as those who will be responsible for building, deploying and managing blockchain.\" The dearth of workers for a hot field Currently, there's a significant lack of skilled blockchain developers, according to job search sites and research firms. That paucity of talent is one of the major stumbling blocks for companies hoping to deploy blockchain. For those with blockchain skills, the job market is red hot. In February, the online job search site HiredÂ reported demand for blockchain engineersÂ was \"through the roof,\" with year-over-year growth of more than 200%. Hired's jobs report, which was in line with earlier reports from LinkedIn and jobs market research firms Burning Glass Technologies andÂ Janco Associates, shows software engineers with blockchain skills are in higher demand than at any time in the past, with the number of positions growing more than five-fold in the past year. While blockchain engineering is the most in-demand skill on the Hired marketplace, only 12% of those surveyed by the firm earlier this year identified blockchain as the top technology they want to learn. Fifty-one percent of survey respondents named Python as one of their most-liked languages, 49% cited Javascript and 19% named. PHP. Another problem affecting the mismatch between the need for blockchain developers and the scarcity of available workers is the difficulty in finding places that offer training, according to Hired CEO Mehul Patel. In general, one in five software engineers is self-taught, according to Hired's data. \"I think generally we are seeing less than half of engineers we looked at had a B.S. degree and one-fifth of them had gone through a year and a half of school. So, one-third of our engineering base are self-taught or taught through non-traditional means,\" Patel said.

(coindesk.com) \u201cBig Four\u201d professional consulting firms Deloitte, KPMG and EY are all in the top five when it comes to posting blockchain job ads, according to new data fromÂ Indeed.com. The employment site released its latest figures for job postings relating to blockchain, cryptocurrency and bitcoin in the U.S. on Thursday, with the data covering the period from February 2018 to February 2019. Topping the table was Deloitte, with IBM and KPMG in second and third place, respectively. EY and Accenture (another major consulting firm) came fourth and fifth, also respectively. Deloitte\u2019s top placing is perhaps not surprising, as the firm has been very active in the blockchain space,Â participating in trials, developing products and offering services around the tech. The consulting giant hasÂ previously said:Â \u201cWe envision that [Deloitte\u2019s] ever-evolving and nimble team will build upon our past success in helping our clients, which includes 92 percent of the financial service companies listed on the Fortune 500 list, to hone their blockchain-backed offerings,\u201d he said.Â  Indeed.com\u2019sÂ data also shows that of all the financial firms, JPMorgan has placed the most ads for blockchain staff over the last year.Â While its chairman and president, Jamie Dimon, is notoriously skeptical of bitcoin, his company is actively preparing for a future where blockchain is a key part of financial infrastructure and notablyÂ revealedÂ its own in-house cryptocurrency in February. No other Wall Street institutions made Indeed\u2019s top 10.Discussing the data,Â Indeed.comÂ economist Andrew Flowers toldÂ ForbesÂ that it\u2019s \u201cnotable that there\u2019s a lack of financial and banking companies hiring for something that\u2019s made to replace money. \u201dMicrosoft andÂ ethereum development studio ConsenSys also made it to the top 10, according to Indeed\u2019s data, in eighth and tenth place, respectively. Flowers further said the last year marks the first time there have been more job postings than searches \u2013 likely because of the decline in crypto prices, as Indeed hasÂ previously suggested. The data shows that searches per million on its site for roles involving blockchain, cryptocurrency and bitcoin declined by 67 percent during the period, while the share of job postings per million increased by 90 percent. Back in November, anotherÂ Indeed.comÂ data reportÂ showedÂ that the number of blockchain job postings increased by 25.49 percent from October 2017 to October 2018.San Jose, San Francisco and New York are the cities with the most blockchain postings, Indeed\u2019s latest report concludes.

Â According to results released today by job-hunting site Indeed.com, JPMorgan Chase was the only financial firm in the top ten companies posting jobs with the words \u201cblockchain,\u201d \u201ccryptocurrency,\u201d or \u201cbitcoin\u201d over the past year. In February 2019, JPMorgan ChaseÂ unveiledÂ JPM Coin, a plan to use blockchain to simplify payments between its clients, after earlier creating a version of the ethereum blockchain, called Quorum, designed to let enterprises capitalize on the benefits of using a shared ledger similar to bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, but withÂ more control over privacy and faster speeds. The only companies to post more jobs than JPMorgan Chase were tech firms IBM and Cisco, and consulting firms Accenture, EY, KPMG, and Deloitte, the last of which posted more jobs than any other company. Wrapping up the top ten list was Microsoft, ethereum incubator ConsenSys, and little-known Conduent, whichÂ spun offÂ from Xerox in 2017 and builds platforms for big businesses and governments. \"It\u2019s notable that there\u2019s a lack of financial Â and banking companies hiring for something that\u2019s made to replace money,\" said Indeed.com economist Andrew Flowers, who has been following the hiring trends for over a year. Doubly notable, he added, was that for the first time ever, there's more job postings than searches. From February 2018 to February 2019, the share of job searches per million on the job site decreased by 67%, Flowers said, further correlating the drop to the decrease in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. \"Job seeker interest has collapsed because it tracks the price of bitcoin,\" Flowers says. \"Job seeker interest is as volatile as the price of bitcoin.\" While the survey doesn\u2019t speculate as to the reason the job postingsÂ have increased in spite of the price drop, one possibility is a recent increase in the number of large companies exploring non-cryptocurrency applications of blockchain. While the decentralized, shared, blockchain ledger that powers bitcoin first promised to let individuals move value without middlemen like banks, enterprises are exploring how similar shared ledgers can enable other movements of value without other middlemen. To give some broader perspective on the trend, the Indeed.com survey shows a 4,086% increase in related job postings to the site since 2016, and a 553% increase in job searches over the same period. To help fill the gap in demand between job postings and searching, traditional institutions like UC Berkley, and specialized programs like the Blockchain Education Network areÂ evolvingÂ to train up-and-coming talent. Demand for these jobs is largely centered in expected areas, with Silicon Valley and San Francisco taking the top two positions for most job postings, followed by New York City, Newark, New Jersey, and Jersey City, which collectively held the third position. Rounding out the top ten geographies posting jobs including the words \u201cblockchain,\u201d \u201ccryptocurrency,\u201d or \u201cbitcoin\u201d are Austin, Texas, Seattle Washington, Denver, Colorado, Washington DC, Boston, Massachusetts, and Los Angeles, California.

Shell is looking for \u201cblockchain analysts\u201d as part of its Information Technology (IT) graduate programme, according to aÂ job listing on its graduate careers website. The job role has seemingly flown under the radar for the last four months after being posted toÂ LinkedIn. According to theÂ job specification, the placement will take place in Shell\u2018s Blockchain Centre of Excellence (CoE). But what does a \u201cblockchain analyst\u201d even do? Well, successful applicants will explore potential new applications of the decentralized technology across all of Shell\u2018s business areas \u2013 from its core in oil and gas to new energies and electric vehicles. They will be responsible for taking potential use cases from \u201cideation\u201d through to implementation. This will include finding new applications of not just blockchain but other decentralized technologies. It\u2019ll then be the responsibility of the analyst to sell these potential uses to the rest of the business, theÂ job listing states. Shell is looking for recent Master\u2019s graduates with backgrounds in the following disciplines: mathematics, computer science, and artificial intelligence.Indeed, it makes sense that Shell is looking for the next generation of business-based blockchain proponents. In November last year, the Dutch firm took part in launching aÂ blockchain-based platform for trading oil, that is replacing a centuries old, traditionally paper-based, process. What\u2019s more, the fact that Shell is hiring graduates points to a greater trend uncovered earlier this month.

In distant second place were machine learning engineers, positions that saw a 12-fold increase during the same period. While blockchain engineering is the most in-demand skill on the Hired marketplace, only 12% of survey respondents identified blockchain as the top technology they want to learn. Fifty-one percent of survey respondents named Python as one of their most-liked languages, while 49% cited Javascript. PHP was ranked the least favorite at 19%.Â  Another problem affecting the mismatch between the need for blockchain developers and a lack of available workers is the difficulty in finding places that offer training, Patel said. In general, one in five software engineers is self-taught, according to Hired's data.\"I think generally we are seeing less than half of engineers we looked at had a B.S. Â degree and one fifth of them had gone through a year and a half of school. So one-third of our engineering base are self-taught or taught through non-traditional means,\" Patel said. Almost two-thirds of the software engineering roles on Hired's platform didn't have blockchain in the title, but did list it as a skill.Â  \"So, I think the title itself is not out there yet, but folks are definitely looking for the skills,\" Patel said.While still relatively rare,Â blockchain training programsÂ have begun to pop up and are now being offered by some of the nation's leading universities, includingÂ Princeton,Â Stanford,Â UC Berkeley, andÂ MIT. Currently, the easiest and fastest way to become proficient is to learn on your own or attend programs organized by blockchain vendors and industry groups, such as Consensys, Blockapps, the Ethereum Foundation and Hyperledger. While blockchain may be a relatively new technology in terms of enterprise deployments, Patel said he's confident demand will continue to be strong for years to come as businesses begin implementing \"their countless use cases\" Those uses involve everything from digital identity and smart contracts to workforce management and distributed data storage. \"I think there's a deep feeling here that blockchain is the next wave of technology innovation that will underpin almost every industry one way or another \u2013 sort of like the first wave of the internet in the 1990s,\" Patel said. \"So no, I don't think this is a temporary thing.\" By Admin 3 comments 3 likes Like Share Feb 28, 2019 (edited) Francisco Gimeno - BC Analyst Philippe Engels and Jorgos 1 Daniel Mihail piramida at s.c piramida s.r.l.

Blockchain elicits all reactions and none. The response from people when the topic is broached can range from a blank stare to a laboured sigh. Some know blockchain only through bitcoin, others don\u2019t know it at all. A small cohort of people will nearly scratch a cornea rolling their eyes at its mere mention, deriding it as a fad. David Wachsman, founder and CEO of Wachsman, certainly disagrees with the technology\u2019s detractors. He, described byÂ CrunchbaseÂ as a \u201cworld-renowned blockchain expert and thought leader\u201d, welcomed me in the glass conference room of his company\u2019s Dublin office. This office recently announced the expansion of its functions beyond PR, now offering a broad swathe of blockchain professional services to clients such as Dash, CoinDesk, Indiegogo, Kik and more. David has been away from his native New York and hopping between Wachsman\u2019s hubs in Ireland and Singapore, the latter of which recently opened. He has been living out of a suitcase for the better part of three months, though it shows neither in his temperament nor appearance. Serene and self-possessed, sitting in the house that blockchain built, his (professional) house, he is confident enough in Ireland\u2019s blockchain scene to double down on his commitment to it.Â He is baffled that the majority of Irish people, according toÂ researchÂ recently published by the company, disagree with him. As many as 75pc of people say they would not consider a career in the area.\u201cMost people don\u2019t know what blockchain is, that\u2019s what our findings found. They don\u2019t get it. To them, it\u2019s simply some buzzword technology. That\u2019s a big PR problem. It\u2019s also a problem for companies that are building out in the space, and we have many here in Ireland who are doing that. \u201dThe blockchain ecosystem in Dublin is in pretty good condition. A healthy mix of blockchain-focused companies such as ConsenSys have operations here. Many of the large consultancy firms have dedicated blockchain labs. Finance giants such as Fidelity Investments and Mastercard have poured resources into gaining a foothold in blockchain. \u201cAll the big tech giants, some of them probably secretly, are looking to hire people with blockchain backgrounds here in Dublin.\u201d Blockchain\u2019s inevitable takeover The proliferation of blockchain technology is as inevitable as the tide coming in. It\u2019ll wash over us all in a matter of time. The march of technological progress is as unrelenting as the spinning of our Earth. It won\u2019t be a case of an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object \u2013 you will be moved into working in blockchain. Though many in the Wachsman survey cited an inappropriate educational background as a reason they would not want to wade into it, the worker of tomorrow will likely learn on the job. \u201cAlmost everyone today works at an internet company. The company itself may not be actually building websites but they probably have one. The company itself isn\u2019t developing email applications but I guarantee you they use [them], or a chat app. Blockchain companies are going to be just like that in future. Blockchain will be a piece of the technology stack that people use every single day.\u201dFor now, most of the blockchain jobs lie in building infrastructure, and the roles are mostly developer roles. David maintains, however, that this is temporary.\u201cTomorrow, it\u2019s going to be every company. I think [workers] are going to gain their skills by simply working with companies endeavouring blockchain.\u201d Steel, your dog and your mobile phone This inevitability doesn\u2019t address the fact that people still neither understand nor trust blockchain as a technology. If it is going to be such a large element of the future of work, as David implies, then a huge obstacle will have to be overcome in order to attract workers to the area. \u201cWe need to do a better job of educating. That means 101-type pieces, that means meet-ups, that means lectures. We need universities to chip in a bit because that\u2019s what they\u2019re really good at: teaching complicated concepts to people. \u201dMore importantly, David adds, a \u201cbig consumer-y brand\u201d or website needs to adopt blockchain. Airlines need to tokenise loyalty points. It needs to be normalised, which will likely happen. The question is, by whom? David cites in particular blockchain\u2019s potential application to the supply chain as the use case he is most excited about \u201cbecause it\u2019s boring\u201d. Supply chains are complicated and expensive with a huge amount of moving parts. Maximising the efficiency of this process by reliably tracking all the various extenuating factors could lower the price of steel. \u201cThat changes the world. \u201dMoving away from the macro, David opines that man\u2019s best friend could end up having as much of a relationship with blockchain as humans. Blockchain, though it\u2019s \u201cpeer-to-peer trading of value\u201d, could easily be applied to energy. \u201cIf your dog were wearing a little backpack with a solar panel on it, that dog, cute as it might be, would be an energy producer. Because of the nature of how energy transmission works, the further you are away from the energy producer, the more is wasted. Imagine your dog being able to power, or at least being able to recharge, your cellphone.\u201d Hello Brexit, goodbye blockchain Thanks to Brexit, Ireland can expect for its blockchain industry, and therefore the number of blockchain jobs, to only grow with time. This is in line with theÂ general jobs boonÂ that Ireland is experiencing as the UK, rather disastrously, attempts to negotiate its way out of the single market. Companies such as Coinbase have announced plans to set up shop in Dublin, citing concerns about Brexit.\u201cIreland is a very important part of Europe. It\u2019s the only English-speaking EU country, and Britain is making damn sure of that. Â I would say that as a launch pad for Europe, it\u2019s a vital place for companies to set up \u2013 blockchain companies [in particular] because it is such a borderless enterprise.

(computerworld.com) The demand for blockchain engineers or software developers has continued to skyrocket over the past year and salaries for those positions are growing in lockstep. The medianÂ salary for a blockchain developerÂ is now $127,000, with experienced individuals commanding upwards of $172,000 when they move to new organizations, according to Janco Associates, a management consulting firm that conducts regular salary surveys. [Â Read about the 2018 Best Places to Work in ITÂ ] \"ERP and Blockchain jobs are in great demand.

Janco Associates Hired, a job recruitment firm, placed the salary for blockchain engineers even higher than Janco, saying theyÂ can command between $150,000 and $175,000Â a year; those jobs are now on par with developers of artificial intelligence (AI). By comparison, software engineers earn an average of $137,000, according to Hired CEO Mehul Patel. \"Since launching blockchain as an expertise on our platform in late 2017, we have witnessed demand for blockchain engineers increase 400%,\" Patel said via email. \"Interestingly, blockchain engineer has not solidified itself as a standalone job title quite yet; instead, blockchain is increasingly being included as an area of expertise for back-end, solutions architects and machine-learning engineers. \"Blockchain, Patel said, is poised to transform everything from how people verify their identities to how money is transferred, and so is expected to have longevity as a career option. [Â Looking to upgrade your career in tech? This comprehensive online course teaches you how.Â ] \"Combine its immense potential with the fact that it\u2019s a new and growing field, and I can see the demand for these roles remaining high for the foreseeable future,\" Patel said. AÂ recent surveyÂ by HIred found IT professionals are increasingly looking for a position that is challenging \u2014 with 64% indicating they\u2019d leave their job if another one offered new challenges and problems to solve. Career positions in AI/machine learning, devops and blockchain will continue to be on the cutting edge of technology, and a priority for hiring needs, Patel said. For those hiring and looking to provide competitive offers to candidates with blockchain or other in-demand skill sets, the option to work remotely is a good incentive. \"In fact, we conducted a recent survey that found that over half of tech talent are interested in working 100% remotely,\" Patel said. \"Offering remote work to fill the demand for blockchain and AI engineers might meet the talent demand for these future-focused companies. \"Over the past 12 months, total job openings for blockchain skills have grown to 12,006, according to job data analytics firmÂ Burning Glass Technologies. That represents a growth rate of 316% over that time frame. In June, Burning Glass Â reported 5,743 blockchain developer jobs. The median advertised salary for Software Developers requiring blockchain is $125,000 to $150,000, according to Burning Glass. Freelance job site,Â Upwork, said demand for blockchain-based positions has increased on average 96% quarter-to-quarter in terms of job postings; it sees Â blockchain development asÂ the hottest skill in the freelance job market today. Skills gap translates into higher pay People with experience using specific blockchain iterations such asÂ SolidityÂ andÂ Hyperledger ComposerÂ are in even higher demand - and that demand is increasing steadily, said Eric Piscini, CEO ofÂ Citizens ReserveÂ and formerly a principal in the technology and banking practices at Deloitte Consulting LLP. Janco Associates \"This is the number one thing I have in mind when I wake up in the morning: 'Where will I find more engineers to join the team,'\" he said in an earlier interview with Computerworld.In addition to postings at established companies such as Deloitte, 2,977 blockchain startupsÂ have posted 2,043 jobs, according to AngelList, a website for investors and job-seekers looking for work at startups. Even as companies are posting a plethora of blockchain jobs, there is a dearth of talent to fill them. According to Upwork's latest figures (posted in June), 53% of hiring managers surveyed cite access to skills as their biggest hiring challenge, and the majority (59%) are already utilizing flexible talent. The top blockchain jobs available todayÂ include entry-level and internship positions; Â blockchain engineers; blockchain project managers; and blockchain developers. The best career opportunities are now in financial services, government agencies and at tech companies; all are seeking ways blockchain can create new efficiencies. Other blockchain positions include quality engineers and legal consultants or attorneys, and blockchain web designers. Large organizations are also planning to beef up their middle management as they focus on Big Data, blockchain and smartphone and tablet connectivity, according to Janco. Where to get blockchain skills Most who choose to add blockchain to their skillset or seek a career as blockchain developers are typically versed in programming languages such as Java or Python, Piscini said. But that's by no means a prerequisite. \"More universities are starting curriculaÂ and the natural cycle to graduate enough students will produce good volumes in the next few years,\" Piscini said. \"We collaborate with universities around the world to develop content and hire the best talent. \"Several accredited U.S. universities now offer courses on blockchain,Â such as MIT, which has offered two courses onÂ cryptocurrency engineering and design, and Stanford University, which hasÂ a course called Bitcoin EngineeringÂ that teaches developers how to create bitcoin-enabled applications. There are also specialty schools, such as Mountain View, Calif.-basedÂ Blockchain UniversityÂ and London-based education startup B9lab, which launched an onlineÂ Certified Ethereum Developer TrainingÂ program in 2016. \"We've been running this and other courses for over two years now and have trained 1,000 people from over 75 countries,\" said Elias Haase, founder of B9lab.The most successful students in B9lab's courses tend to have sysadmin experience and have worked with Javascript before, Hasse said. But \"with the right amount of focus, we've seen people from different backgrounds do really well.\"Our youngest student was 14, the oldest 76. So we've seen a pretty broad variety of developers,\" he said.

In fact,Â back in its early stages programming was primarily a female-oriented profession andÂ women were the largest trained technical workforce of the computing industry during the second world war right through until the mid-sixties.Â Then in the 1970\u2019s things changed. Personal computers came onto the market. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates came onto the scene,Â job advertisements for programmers started targeting males. Computer games were targeted at boys, andÂ the stereotype of the computer programmer as a reclusive, anti-social eccentric male nerd was born. TheÂ number of women majoring in computer science and software development began to drop, from close to 40 per cent in the 1980\u2019s to around 15 percent today.Â Â In crypto and blockchainÂ less than nine percentÂ of the current community are femaleÂ and the number of female programmers in this space is even less. HTTPS://COIN.DANCE/STATS So how can this trend be reversed and how can the unhelpful stereotype of recent years be undone? How can we once again encourage, support and train female programmers to ensure women are an equal and integral part of this booming and promising industry? After all, blockchain is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to transform many industries andÂ the way we do business, but doing so will requireÂ divergent thinking, different perspectives, creativity and the ability to innovate, all of which, research shows time and time again, are driven by diversity \u2013 gender included. At the same time we live in a world facing many complex, interconnected and wicked problems, the likes of which cannot be solved with the same thinking that created them. We need all of our collective and diverse ideas and experiences to come up with the solutions to today\u2019s challenges and create tomorrow\u2019s future.Many in the industry recognize this power of diversity. Marie Wieck, General Manager atÂ IBM BlockchainÂ believes that, \u201cwhen you get interdisciplinary engagement and skills and people who have come from different backgrounds, that really does create an innovation sandbox.\u201dÂ  Cryptocurrency exchange,Â Cryptopia,Â are working to increase diversity across all teams, \u201cnot to only reach gender parity, but as a strong step forward in striving towards the creativity and ingenuity that fuels innovation \u2013Â which can only be achieved through diversity. \u201dIn addition, gender diversity can lead to higher returns and valuation, according to Salam Khanji,Â CTO of Jordan based blockchain companyÂ Green Tomorrow. A study of gender diversity in some of the top firms in the US found that, on average,Â female representation in top management leads to an increase ofÂ $42 million in firm value.Â Â  Clearly gender diversity pays.How Can We Make Programming Cool For Girls Again?Â Redefine The Image\u201cThere are a lot of anecdotal studies that say if you can\u2019t see yourself in a role that you are unlikely to pursue it,\u201d says Wieck. There needs to be more female role models and they need to be positively profiled in the field through media coverage, awards and promotion to visible leadership roles. We also need to highlight the dynamic nature and features of the job.Â  Programmer roles are often seen as a very static, isolated roles, sitting in a cubicle, tied to your laptop for hours on end coding with little human interaction. In reality programmer roles are much more dynamic and involve problem solving, product development, client interaction and business involvement, with many different roles and levels of opportunity. We need to articulate and promote the dynamics of the role in job advertisementsÂ and through media coverageÂ if we are to attract more diverse applicants to these positions. Shift The Culture The culture of any workplace or industry is hugely influential on the type of people it attracts and retains. Developing policies around inclusion and diversity are just the beginning. Addressing deeper issues such as unconscious bias in hiring and promotion practices as well as adjusting recruitment processes are important to shift organizational culture and give women an equal footing in any role, including as programmers. New Zealand blockchain Company,Â Centrality,Â haveÂ deliberatelyÂ adapted their hiring process to increase recruitment of female programmers including interviewing all non-male applicants that apply.Â CentralityÂ co-founder Aaron McDonald observes thatÂ \u201coften women undersell their skills in their CV and so interviewing them will help to understand their skills better. \u201dDigital Currency platform,Â Coinbase,Â have made commitments to hiring inclusively. 33 percent of their leadership roles are held by women and for each open position at the VP level and above, the company ensures that three qualified people from underrepresented backgrounds are interviewed. Addressing Mid-Career Drop Outs, Role Flexibility and Re-Training There is presently a high mid-career drop out rate of women in tech. This is a time whenÂ women are often juggling their career with caregiver roles, whether elder care or childcare, requiring some flexibility and accommodations to be able to continue to fulfil both roles. It\u2018s also a time when they may be returning to work after some time off. These years away from the industry, especially one that is evolving so rapidly, often leaves a gap on their CV and in their skill sets. Re-skilling programs and considerations in hiring processes are vital to ensuring talented female programmers are re-employed and supported to advance their career at this critical juncture. CentralityÂ combines a culture of flexibility with high levels of accountability to accommodate and encourage more female programmers in their company who often are juggling family commitments.Â  WhilstÂ ThoughtWareÂ CEO Sonja Bernhardt sees flexibility and agility as critical to retaining and attracting her 100% female coding team. She says, \u201cWe are highly agile in how we are structured and how we operate. Core values at ThoughtWare are about individuals and thinking, with people accepting adult responsibility for what they do and when they do it. \u201dÂ When it comes to retraining and hiring mid-career women,Â IBM BlockchainÂ Wieck says,Â \u201cEven though we have a great track record in both advancing and recruiting womenÂ toÂ IBM, we still find that they drop out of tech more frequently than men. So weÂ formed a program called Pathways to Technology that is mentoring that mid-careerÂ woman and also looking at the re-entry of women who may have stepped outÂ because of family needs and how to reintroduce them into the workforce and catchÂ them up given the fast pace of change in skills. \u201dFormal leadership development programs at this mid-career level have also proven to be critical to retaining female talent in any organisation, including female technologists. According toÂ AnitaB.org,\u201cInvesting in formal leadership development programs lets women know that their growth and advancement is a priority. They help women clearly identify their goals and create strategies for reaching positions of greater influence and responsibility\". Educate And Train Newcomers The tech industry has faced criticism for not attracting and retaining female workers and much of this criticism is certainly warranted. However, many blockchain companies say they would love to employ more female programmers but they simply aren\u2019t out there or aren\u2019t applying for the jobs. So clearly, despite all best efforts and intentions there is also a pipeline issue \u2013 a training and education issue.Â Organizations likeÂ Girls Who Code,Â She CodesÂ andÂ Rails GirlsÂ are doing their bit to train and encourage young women to code but more must be done to target women to learn the craft. Whilst jobs in technology and blockchain are poised for ongoing growth and expansion, women presently represent a very small percentage of these roles. Â Building an inclusive workplace and recruiting and retaining more female programmers requires strategic, ongoing effort including an overhaul of the unconscious bias and stereotyped image of the role. But this effort is critical for our industry to thrive and develop the diverse products and solutions needed for the 21stÂ century and to solve the wicked problems of our time.

(abovethelaw.com) The blockchain industry is a great choice for any lawyer willing to make a bold move. ByÂ OLGA V. MACK At this point, you\u2019ve definitely heard ofÂ blockchainÂ (or Bitcoin or cryptocurrency,Â blockchain\u2019s most famous applications). But have you considered how you could integrate it into your career? It\u2019s easy to be intimidated byÂ blockchain, but it\u2019s a relatively simple idea. Blockchain simply refers to a digitized economic ledger where information blocks are connected to each other in chains through cryptography. It can be used to record a wide variety of information, especially financial and economic information. The information is held on a universally accessible register that is regularly updated and is considered incorruptible. The development of blockchain technology was originally to cater to the use of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, but its applications are expanding to nearly every field. This exciting new industry can offer you a chance to completely change your career and become a leader in this unexplored territory. Â Â Â Relatively Easy Entry Blockchain andÂ smart contractÂ experts are extremely rare, despite the high demand for these professionals in the industry. With a little practice and experience, you can easily enter the industry and become extremely successful. The relative newness of the technology means that the industry is not already saturated with professionals who are adept at handling blockchain andÂ smart contracts. In addition, becoming an expert is quite easy in this industry as it is still in its developing stages and is not yet too complex for a determined person to master. In fact, you can help shape and even lead its development. Finally, the industry is Â relatively easy to enter, as it does not have any legal requirements such as licenses or certifications for you to become an expert in the different elements of business. Â Â Â Digitized Assets Digital assets are now common, especially with the role of the internet in our daily lives. The information collected from our browsing and social media is an extremely important aspect of the advertising industry. Blockchain technology is a great asset for handling these types of digital assets as it allows for the distribution of digital information. In fact, it is actually the structure of a new form of internet. This is the future of technology and you definitely do not want to be left out when this industry blows up. Â Â Â It Pays The lack of professionals in the industry means that the existing experts receive great remunerations. Already, professionals who are in this industry are paid much higher than those still using the typical financial structures. If you are considering entering this industry, then you can look forward to a great salary. This is probably the most compelling reason why you should enter these industries. As you become an expert, you can expect your salary to continue to increase. More jobs but few workers allows you to negotiate great salaries.

Forbes (forbes.com) The blockchain technology market could top $2 billion in three years as companies, NGOs and governments understand the potential create customer trust, cut down on counterfeit goods, reduce transaction costs, and reach emerging markets. While there are a growing number of ways blockchain is being used in banking, retail, andÂ education, it\u2019s still relatively difficult to learn the skills to compete for lucrative new jobs being created. According to largest global freelancing websiteÂ Upwork, blockchain is ranked as the hottest technology in its quarterly skills index. Â Even with the cool down of the cryptocurrency markets, the demand for blockchain job skills grew six thousand percent in just the first quarter of this year. Juha Mikkola, co-founder of Wyncode Academy, a coding school, said some developers are being paid double the going rate for their blockchain experience. \"It's not just tech companies that need this talent, it's real-estate, non-profits, and banks,\"Â Mikkola said. Early Blockchain Education Initiatives Leading university computer science programs have been quick to respond. According to new research, 42 percent of the top 50 universities in the world offer at least one course on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

(information-age.com) Information Age's guide on how to introduce blockchain to your enterprise in the face of the digital skills crisis. Looking at everything, from upskilling schemes and outsourcing to how CTOs can impact change in relation to how universities shape their degrees With the proliferation of blockchain initiatives comes a unique need for a diverse range of skills, including engineering, app development,Â cyber security, and decentralised governance, to name just a few. All this makes for a criterion that is hard to meet. Beyond all the marketing and sales hype, blockchain has managed to establish itself as a realistic disrupter in the tech space, particularly for its potential ability to transform traditional business channels, supply chains and communications.Industry titans like Mastercard, IBM, British Airways and Samsung are just some of the organisations currently spearheading blockchain initiatives, and at the same time, blockchain-based start-ups are increasing at an agile rate. Between them, what they each hope to get out of their blockchain projects differs significantly. However, whatever their end-goal may be, they will all face similar roadblocks along the way.In this guide, I\u2019m going to talk about some of the ways CTOs can overcome some of these hurdles. However, instead of focusing on the limitations of the technology itself, I want to focus on one of the less talked about challenges facing CTOs and their utilisation of blockchain: finding the talent to use it. The talent shortage in blockchain The skills shortage relating to blockchain has become a real pain for IT leaders who desperately want to experiment with it.Of course, the lack of talent is not exclusive to blockchain, CTOs looking to incorporate things like; AI, machine learning or big data, I\u2019m sure, know this only too well. >See also:Â Closing the skills gap: Developing the next generation of STEM talent However, with the proliferation of blockchain initiatives comes a unique need for a diverse range of skills, including engineering, app development,Â cyber security and decentralised governance, to name just a few.

As such, there is a lot to choose from, with major organisations like Amazon, Oracle and Baidu all offering blockchain services. For CTOs trying to weigh the pros and cons of each of these providers \u2013 and if the wisdom of the crowd means anything \u2013 a recent study by the consultancy firm,Â Juniper Research, may be worth looking at. They surveyed close to 400 company founders, executives, managers and IT leaders, and identified IBM, Microsoft and Accenture as clear leaders in blockchain solutions.

However, despite the complexity of blockchain, depending on what an organisation wants from this type of technology, you may not necessarily need people with degrees from the top universities. Sometimes all that is required is a little bit of training. >See also:Â Prioritising skills in the digital age Jobs of this sort of often referred to as \u201cnew-collar careers\u201d.

The term was coined by IBM\u2019s CEO, Ginni Rometty, in relation to \u201cmiddle-skill\u201d occupations in technology, such as cyber security analysts, application developers and cloud computing specialists. According to Rometty,Â speaking on CNBC: \u201cFor the future, there are many jobs that can be done without a four-year degree.

I think this sounds like an interesting option for very evident reasons, in that as the IT industry continues to evolve, it is critical to bring in young and diverse talent. However, if you are going to open your company to \u201cnew-collar workers\u201d, it is vital that you put in place a structure that will help them upskill and give them opportunities to contribute in fields like blockchain. In-house training schemes Some companies, like IBM, have taken this into account with their blockchain projects, and perhaps their strategies can be an example for all CTOs.IBM, who is recognised as a leading blockchain vendor, have used an in-house training scheme to attract and retain talent. The company also has an internal blockchain community boasting more than 5,000 active members. >See also:Â Breaking down training barriers with technology An interesting part of this initiative is how it offers certificates, so employees can then display theirÂ skillsÂ on their resumes or LinkedIn profiles.I think this is an important feature which not only encourages participation by way of offering recognition; it also helps IBM understand the type of skills they have. >See also:Â 5 benefits of using webinars to train new employees According to theÂ Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, UK employers are spending less on training than other major EU economies. Although this statistic doesn\u2019t relate solely to blockchain, it does point to a basic attitude problem when we think about the skills gap.CTOs should look into how they can upskill their existing staff. This means they should consider educational platforms that can help, and they should remember that education doesn\u2019t end in the classroom. Make blockchain open While universities across the world create thousands of courses, fustratingly, graduates still struggle to link their degrees to careers. For example, in the UKÂ 11.7% of computer science graduates spend six months unemployedÂ after completing their degrees, despite the huge demand for them. I think this points to a good reason for why CTOs and recruiters need to rethink how they currently engage with educational institutes. Hope may be on the horizon with the recent launch of the Institute of Coding.Â With funding from the UK Government\u2019sÂ Higher Education Funding Council for EnglandÂ and elsewhere, the IoC, led by theÂ University of Bath, aims to bring together a consortium of more than 60 universities, national and international corporations, SMEs, industry groups and experts in non-traditional learning professional bodies to bridge the divide.Information Age recently spoke with their director, Dr Rachid Hourizi,Â who explained how CTO\u2019s can work with them to develop the type of teams they need.Â  He said: \u201cWe are keen to develop new courses, so if you\u2019re a CTO of a company and you just can\u2019t get the kind of educated staff you need, or there are soft skills that are not being developed, we are enthusiastic to hear about how we can help.\u201d >See also:Â Interview with Dr Rachid Hourizi, Director of the Institute of CodingIn relation to blockchain, I also spoke with Professor John Domingue, Director of the Knowledge Media Institute at the Open University, who is currently working with IoC to better link blockchain education to the needs of industries.

It's receivedÂ influential endorsementsÂ from government leaders, industry titansÂ and ambitiousÂ entrepreneursÂ in an unprecedented acknowledgment of theÂ technology's prowess. Related:Â The Cryptocurrency Job Market Is Exploding (Infographic) To be sure, they aren't wrong. Blockchain, which was first developed to account for the popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is now one of the most dynamic technologies today. AsÂ The New York TimesÂ wrote back in January, \"The Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain.\" All of this enthusiasm has created a surging demand for blockchain-related jobs. According toÂ Upwork, a global freelance exchange, blockchain-related skills were the most in-demand on its platform in the first quarter of 2018. Moreover,Â TechCrunchÂ reports that \"Blockchain-related jobs are the second-fastest growing in today's labor market; there are now 14 job openings for every one blockchain developer.\" TRADITIONAL PATHS MAY NOT FIT. For decades, high school students had a beaten path to follow, and the formula was relatively simple: Do well enough in high school to attend a college, earn a degree in a desirable fieldÂ and attain a high-paying job. A college degree was thought to serve as a promise for a well-paying, stable job. Recently, that promise seems like more of an aphorism. In 2013,Â The Washington PostÂ divulged, \"Only 27 percent of college grads have a job related to their major. \" Meanwhile, college graduates are leaving school with unprecedented levels of debt. TheÂ average student graduatesÂ college with more than $37,000 in student debt. Collectively, U.S. student debt approaches $1.5 trillion. In a head-turning study,Â Citizens Financial GroupÂ found that college grads designate a fifth of their salaries to student debt repayments, and they do so for nearly two decades after graduation. Related:Â An Illustrated Glossary of Cryptocurrency Slang (Infographic) Interestingly, as the labor market tightens, and companies struggle to locate candidates with a bachelor's degree, there is a growing consensus that a candidate's skills are more important than his or her formal education.Â Deloitte, a research and consulting firm with strong connections to the blockchain industry, supports this assessment. A 2017 Deloitte study found that \"aspiring workers should realize that a bachelor's degree is not all that matters to their future. In itself, a bachelor's degree is just a piece of paper. It's the skills -- and the occupation -- that matter more. When it comes to employment, that's the real goal of education.\" In many ways, this isn't a particularly shrewd observation. There areÂ plenty of successful peopleÂ with viable, even extraordinary careers without attaining a bachelor's degree. A BLOCKCHAIN EDUCATION It's clear that those looking for a career in blockchain technology will be following a different script than tech entrepreneurs who came before them. With that in mind, what's the best way to strategically establish a career in blockchain technology? What the blockchain industry needs are people who are continually developing their skills, and staying up to date with the industry's advancement. There are steps blockchain enthusiasts can take to start developing their career without having to sign up to a traditional university program or attend an expensive seminar. 1. BUILD THE BASICS. Blockchain is unlike any other technology available. Understanding its unique value proposition is a critical building block of a blockchain education. Features likeÂ decentralization,Â smart contractsÂ andÂ DappsÂ are more than just buzzwords. They are the essence of the blockchain, and any successful blockchain professional will intimately understand them. Related:Â 8 Benefits of Blockchain to Industries Beyond Cryptocurrency More technical skills also form the foundation of a blockchain developer. JavaScript for web development and Solidity, a popular programming language for constructing smart contracts, are a great place to start. Not only do these skills help with a blockchain education, but they equip learners to freelance as a web designer while they learn to develop the rest of their blockchain-related skills. In this case, a level of formal education can be helpful, but that doesn't mean aspiring blockchain developers need to enroll at a university. Instead, online education platforms like offer comprehensive courses. 2. CONSIDERÂ CYPTOGRAPHY. Assets are increasingly moving online, underscoring the importance of cryptography. Blockchain is renowned for its ability to protect and secure these assets, and it relies on cryptography to make this possible. Failure to appropriately employ cryptography can have devastating consequences for companies that depend on it for security. High-level cryptography training is available online from reputable, affordable venues, likeÂ Coursera and Udacity. Related:Â 4 Great Industries for Blockchain Advancement and Forward-Thinking Entrepreneurs 3. UNDERSTAND DISTRIBUTING COMPUTING THEORY AND APPLICATION. Distributed computing is no longer a theory. In an age where reliability and security are two of the most pressing issues facing tech proliferation,Â distributed computingÂ is the blockchain's solution. However, this is far from a refined practice. There are still many areas in need of solutions. For example, issues of scalability andÂ excessive energy consumptionÂ continue to plague its implementation. Students of blockchain technology need to study these issues so they can, later on, start to develop solutions to the problem. 4. MAINTAIN COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT. Blockchain and the cryptocurrencies that it powers are unique for their active communities that help encourage their growth and popularity. There are hundreds of new cryptocurrency projects, and they can function as an on-the-job training mechanism for blockchain students. Reach out to reputable, verifiable blockchain startups and offer your services with community outreach, which includes event organization, discussionÂ leadershipÂ and other engagement-oriented activities. While this isn't a perceptible skill, it's an opportunity to engage and network with people in the field while also gaining personal insight into the industry and its community. It's a tangible way to begin participating in a blockchain-based career. 5. FORGE YOUR OWN PATH. The blockchain job market is thriving, and those looking to get involved can follow their own path to success. Rather than spending years at an academic institution to prepare for a blockchain career, these DIY strategies can streamline the process and make it more viable for just about anyone to attempt. The market is flourishing, and the opportunity is there for the taking. https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/How-You-Can-Build-a-Career-in-Blockchain-13023809.php By Admin 1 comment 3 likes Like Share Jun 26, 2018 (edited) Francisco Gimeno - BC Analyst Moises and Persida Momcilovic 2 Francisco Gimeno - BC Analyst Blockchain and crypto skills are essential for those who are going to work in this industry.

The total number of connectedÂ Internet of ThingsÂ (IoT) sensors and devices is expected to leap from 21 billion this year to 50 billion by 2022, according toÂ recent dataÂ from Juniper Research. [ Further reading:Â What is blockchain? The most disruptive tech in decadesÂ ]Â  The massive growth in IoT connected devices over the next four years, Juniper claims, is driven mainly by edgeÂ computingservices \u2013 the processing of data away from the cloud and closer to the source. A substantial portion of the estimated 46 billion industrial and enterprise devices connected in 2023 will rely on edge computing, Juniper said, so addressing key challenges around standardization and deployment will be crucial. Blockchain, the electronic, distributed ledger technology (DLT) that also contains a business automation software component \u2013 known as self-executing \"smart contracts\" \u2013 could offer a standardized method for accelerating data exchange and enabling processes between IoT devices by removing the middleman. That middleman: aÂ serverÂ that acts as the central communication spoke for requests and other traffic among IoT devices on a network. IT INSIGHTS What is blockchain technology? \"Fundamentally, the idea is you don't have a central agent \u2013 no one approving and validating every single transaction. Instead, you have distributed nodes that participate in validating every transaction in theÂ network,\" said Mario Milicevic, a member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a leading authority on technology innovation that has more than 500,000 members. Making a better supply chain In a traditional supply chain setting, Milicevic explained, a central server authenticates Â the movement of goods and materials from one location to another. Or a central authority could decide to halt certain processes based on pre-determined rules. In a distributed blockchain IoT network, the IoT devices on a peer-to-peer, mesh network could authenticateÂ transactionsÂ and execute transactions based on pre-determined rules \u2013 without a central server. Blockchain technology could also improve security through decentralized interaction and data exchange by bringing scalable, distributed security and trust to IoT devices, applications and platforms. The technology uses hashing algorithms to create an unchangeable record of transactions, and that information can be encrypted and only accessed through public and private keys. Smart contract software, self-executing code that could be embedded on each IoT chip, could determine what action takes place when a condition is met. Those actions would only be executed when an incoming transaction authenticated. \"So, you don't need central agency to tell each node when to do something,\" Milicevic said. SponsoredPostÂ Sponsored byÂ SAS Images of deforestation can fight climate change A Brazilian information society expert shares how the power of data can advance the social good. Blockchain ledgers decrease the time required to complete IoT device information exchange and processing time.\"It could be in an automotive manufacturing plant. As soon as a certain part arrives, that part then communicates that to other nodes at that destination, which would agree that part arrived and communicate that to entire network. The new node would then be allowed to begin doing its work,\" Milicevic said. The rise of edge computing is critical in scaling up tech deployments, owing to reduced bandwidth requirements, faster application response times and improvements in data security, according to Juniper research.Blockchain experts from IEEE believe that when blockchain and IoT are combined they can actually transform vertical industries. While financial services and insurance companies are currently at the forefront of blockchain development and deployment, transportation, government and utilities sectors are now engaging more due to the heavy focus on process efficiency,Â supply chain and logistics opportunities, said David Furlonger, a Gartner vice president and research fellow. For example, pharaceuticals are required by law to be shipped and stored in temperature-controlled conditions, and data about that process is required for regulatory compliance. The process for tracking drug shipments, however, is highly fragmented. Many pharmaceutical companies pay supply chain aggregators to collect the data along the journey to meet the regulatory standards. Last year, SAP partnered with IBM to demo how IoT and blockchain could automate a pharmaceutical supply chain for both tracking and reporting purposes. SAP combined itsÂ Leonardo IoT software platformÂ withÂ IBM's blockchain cloud serviceÂ to create a working model of a system that could track and manage pharma supply chains using smart contract rules.One misconception about blockchain, is that it replaces legacy systems. \"In fact, blockchain is a layer on top of enterprise applications.\" BrandPostÂ Sponsored byÂ Huawei How banks are looking to their foundations to take digital leadershipThere is fierce technology-driven competition in the financial sector. What is driving this trend, and what are banks doing to meet the evolving needs of customers via digital platforms? SAP also recently completed two proof-of-concept (PoC) blockchain deployments with customers: one was a smaller supply chain test evaluating millions of transactions on a Hyperledger blockchain using smart contract technology in IoT devices; the second was a much larger one that represented billions of transactions among 15 different customers usingÂ MultiChain open-source blockchain softwareÂ without smart contract code on the devices. The smaller PoC with smart-contract technology worked well, but was more expensive to set up because it required a blockchain developer \u2013 someone that's in short supply \u2013 to write the code, said Gil Perez, head of Digital Customer Initiatives for SAP. \"In the small pilot, the cost of operations and overhead was rather high. So, functionally it exceeded expectations, but from financial perspective it was very challenging,\" Perez said. The second PoC addressed both scalability and cost, in that it proved the blockchain could scale to enterprise levels and didn't require a developer to write smart contract code for the IoT devices; instead the business automation ran on servers separate from the blockchain. The MultiChain PoC was not as efficient as the Hyperledger model, but it cost less and it met the busienss requirements, Perez said. He added that the smaller PoC required more complex logic in the form of smart-contract code on IoT devices. \"The fact that you put the logic on a server doesn\u2019t mean it's not automated,\" Perez said, referring to the larger PoC. \"We have the flexibility to put the logic in different places. The deployment and business use cases need to consider not only the technological capabilties but the business and commercial implications.\" SAP has been working with about 65 of its customers to develop blockchain augmentedÂ  software \u2013 something Perez said will soon be available.\"It just becomes a part of the upgrade cycle. It\u2019s built into the standard software SAP provides them,\" Perez said. \"If SAP has a standard application and we add the capability to extend or augment the application for blockchain capabilities, we believe it will help also accelerate the adoption of blockchain. At its Sapphire Conference in May, SAP announced a blockchain cloud service for its customers -- something that's also becoming a popular option for companies that don't want to expend capital in order to test distributed ledger technology. IBM also recently launched anÂ IoT-to-blockchain serviceÂ as an add-on to its existingÂ IoT Connection Service. It enables IoT devices, such as RFID location chips, barcode scans or device-reported data, to be transmitted to a permissioned blockchain on IBM's cloud service. That blockchain-based network can then be used by a business network of computers to validate provenance. Devices able to communicate data to blockchain ledgers can update or validate smart contracts. For example, as an IoT-connected shipment of goods moves along multiple distribution points, the package location and temperature information could be updated on a blockchain. This allows all parties to share information and status of the package as it moves among multiple parties to ensure the terms of a contract are met,Â according to IBM. SAPNew uses for blockchain will continue grow because of the DLT's ability to provide new forms of security, according toÂ B2B reviews platform G2 Crowd.\"Information security and corporate integrity have both taken a blow after events like the Equifax catastrophe, and companies are investing in blockchain as a precaution,\" G2 Crowd said in a report. Blockchain enables secure access to IoT sensors For example, global wireless network technology provider ABB Wireless adopted blockchain as a method for delivering decentralized security services for industrial systems in industries such as utilities, oil and gas, and transportation. Cybersecurity for IoT is becoming more relevant as industries transition into the age of \"smart\" systems, which use tiny electronic devices to communicate with, and control, everything from building HVACs to international cargo shipments. ABB Wireless is usingÂ a blockchain platform developed by Xage, a startup that officially launched earlier this month.ABB Wireless used Xage's security application running on edge gateways within a number of components at power utility substations. The mesh network enables secure, remote access to IoT devices to control the substations, allowing for everything from viewing maintenance data to rerouting power. On a system with thousands or tens of thousands of IoT nodes, the possibility of hacking the network is remote at best.\"If you add a million more smart meters to a wireless network, you've just made that network harder to hack. Whereas in a traditional network, the more units you add, the more exposure there is to hacking,\" said Xage CEO Duncan Greatwood. The blockchain app contains an encrypted and immutable table of security credentials, which allows field workers to log into a device \u2013 even if the substation is disconnected from a utilities' central data center due to an accident, such as a wildfire. \"Everyone's scared to death that someone is going to get control of the grid,\" said Paul Gordon, vice president of engineering and operations at ABB Wireless. \"This provides a solution in a scalable way, so security doesn't become a huge burden. It allows for a more scalable solution while meeting needs of highly secured environment.\" Combining the immutability of a blockchain distributed ledger with encryption means that the more end nodes that are added, theÂ moreÂ secure the network becomes, unlike traditional relational database systems that have a single point of access. Blockchain-on-IoT devices are more secure because a cyber attacker would need to break into a majority of the nodes to gain controllable access to a system. Blockchain is under-researched; CIOs remain cautious Blockchain itself is still a wildly understudied technology. In anÂ IEEE databaseÂ of 40 million research papers, only 480 contain the term \"blockchain,\" said Milicevic, who is a staff communication systems engineer atÂ MaxLinear, a provider of high-performance broadband and networking semiconductor products. [ Related:Â The top 5 problems with blockchainÂ ]\" There is research, but it's at a very high level from what I've seen. I haven't seen anything really deep,\" Milcevic said.Many of the high-level level articles in the IEEE database are focused on potential applications, with many of those mentioning IoT networks and how a marriage with blockchain could improve supply chains. There are, however, \"very few examples\" of real-world blockchain networks that have been deployed; that kind of information could provide businesses with data about the number of nodes, power consumption, and the efficiency of an IoT network before and after blockchain was deployed. It would also offer examples of project failures, Milcevic said.\"We don't understand the cost or the security issues, such as what would happen if rogue nodes could overtake the network. Today, you still have a centralized authority that can shut the network down,\" Milcevic said. \"In decentralized network there is no central authority. I've yet to see a hard study on that. I think everyone is waiting to see what everyone else does. That's the challenge. No one really knows what everyone else is doing.\" When there's no central authority and only a mesh network of automated nodes, it's scary,\" Milicevic said.For example, an IoT sensor manufacturer could place security backdoors in the device software that could be activated with a trojan horse or a virus. \"In fact, someone may have paid me as an employee of that company to install a back door that may allow me to come into your network without you knowing,\" Milcevic said. \"If you're able to have more than 50% of computing power controlled in rogue nodes then the entire history of the blockchain could be overwritten with whatever you want.\" One strength of a blockchain ledger, however, is that it cannot be overwritten; it is a write-once, append-many technology. So, the history of all transactions on the peer-to-peer network remains regardless of any intrusion.The lack of real world examples of blockchain deployments is one reason C-level executives are cautious about embracing the technology. A recent survey of CIOs by Gartner highlighted that trend. Only 1% of the CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organizations, and only 8% said they were in short-term planning or active experimentation with blockchain, according toÂ Gartner's 2018 CIO Survey. Gartner\"This year's Gartner CIO Survey provides factual evidence about the massively hyped state of blockchain adoption and deployment,\" said Furlonger. \"It is critical to understand what blockchain is and what it is capable of today, compared to how it will transform companies, industries and society tomorrow.\" By Admin 0 comments 2 likes Like Share Jun 26, 2018 Francisco Gimeno - BC Analyst and Jakobo Gimeno Hiring for the blockchain revolution: How to create an expert team | VentureBeat (venturebeat.com) As head of human resources for a rapidly-expanding company within the blockchain industry, I am constantly faced with a variety of challenges that are unlike any I\u2019ve encountered in my nearly 10 years of experience working in the corporate and financial sectors. Very early on, I realized that finding top professionals for this exciting, yet uncertain, space was going to require more than just an average hiring rubric, and assembling an efficient and collaborative team was going to require careful due diligence and thoughtful consideration. I liken it to what\u2019s known as a \u201cGreenfield Site,\u201d where we have a unique opportunity to build out a company from the ground up \u2014 complete with candidates from myriad practice areas and varying levels of experience. Instead of marching ahead with a traditional hiring strategy, I first asked myself: How can you effectively hire for an industry that\u2019s just beginning to formalize its policies, and what job-specific skills do you look for in potential candidates that have never heard of blockchain? Over the past year, with the help of two top-notch technical recruiters, my team has hired 78 industry professionals, with 40 hired in the past three months. While this is certainly fast-paced growth, it\u2019s not unprecedented. In fact, there has been aÂ 320Â percent growth in the number of blockchain jobs offered on popular hiring sites in the past 12 months, with aÂ 52Â percent increase in blockchain-related job searches from June to November 2017 alone. The industry as we know it is changing, and companies are looking for bright, engaged, professionals from an array of different industries and career stages to provide their expertise. The following is a brief overview of my experiences, as well as my take on how other blockchain companies can compile an expert team in the most exciting and innovative field since the dawn of the internet. Finding candidates This past year has been overwhelmingly referred to as the \u201cgolden year of blockchain.\u201d What was once an industry comprised of small-scale startups with largely unstructured teams has since flourished into a global industry with a current market capitalization of $269 billion. This is certainly promising news for the future of blockchain, but for HR professionals it means hiring top talent is surprisingly difficult. And that means it\u2019s difficult to scale. With rapid fluctuations in the space due to hyper-expansion and regulatory formalization, it\u2019s becoming harder to ensure that prospective candidates have the necessary experience to understand the shifting requirements.In setting substantive recruiting expectations, I recommend starting from a standpoint of company culture and engagement. Does this candidate fully understand the current climate surrounding the blockchain industry, or, perhaps more importantly, do they understand the mission of the company? Do they have any relevant experience in the blockchain industry? And, if not, how has their prior experience prepared them to take on this upcoming role? These are some of the first questions I\u2019ll ask in any interview.As the industry begins to gain mainstream momentum, hiring top candidates with blockchain expertise will become less of a rarity. However, for the time being, finding individuals with a deep-seated understanding of the company\u2019s mission, as well as a demonstrated interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency, is a far more achievable metric. As with any team, there\u2019s certainly a learning curve, and rejecting candidates simply for their lack of experience could result in losing highly-qualified individuals. Building a team For most HR departments, building out a team is a formulaic process. Managers hire their direct reports with approval from senior executives. This is certainly true for blockchain companies. However, as startups begin to transition into fully-realized companies, new positions become necessary that might not have been pertinent six months ago. Service providers with soft skills, particularly in the communications, legal, and marketing practice areas, are excellent examples of this. Of course, key skills needed as a startup may no longer be required for the next phase of growth so companies have tough decisions to make. In anticipation of new positions, in new departments, in new regions of the world, HR professionals should set up a precautionary hiring policy that establishes where incoming service providers will fit into the overall company structure. Similarly, as blockchain companies continue to expand, HR professionals will need to ensure that internal protocols, including onboarding, performance reviews, and training programs, grow to meet the heightened demand. Regardless of size or scale, every incoming person should feel adequately prepared for their given position and understand the requirements expected of them. This cannot be overstated. Fostering a future Without a crystal ball, it\u2019s impossible to accurately predict what the future will hold for blockchain. The industry is on an unprecedented trajectory, the likes of which even the most optimistic crypto experts could not have anticipated. For HR professionals, this ambiguity can present itself as a daunting and intimidating process. However, I urge you to think of it more as an opportunity \u2014 to use this \u201cGreenfield Site\u201d to find top talent, create a team of experts in their field from around the globe, and foster the next generation of crypto specialists. At my company, for example, we are working with education and research programs \u2014 establishing the Blockchain Technology Laboratory at the University of Edinburgh, establishing an Input Output Cryptocurrency Collaborative Research Chair within the Tokyo Tech School of Computing, and providing the \u2018Haskell & Cryptocurrency\u2019 course to students in Athens, Barbados, and soon in Ethiopia. This lets us take our candidate search directly to the classroom, informing students about the promise of blockchain and inspiring them to solve real-world problems in this space. The goal of our training courses is to extend the computer science training of participants and introduce them to Haskell, an elegant functional programming language, in the context of the cryptocurrency industry. At the end of each course, students are given the opportunity to apply for positions and continue their professional career in Haskell. Through education programs like these, we have a unique opportunity to reach an untapped pool of global candidates, as well as to inform and inspire their future relationship with blockchain. As HR professionals in the most fast-paced industry in the world, it\u2019s our shared duty to find and cultivate collaborative teams, as well as to create an environment conducive to their long-term success. Amid such rapid expansion, it can be easy to lose sight of the qualities that make an effective team member. However, with a clear vision, careful planning, and an acute attention to detail, not only can we turn once lofty ambitions into a concrete plan of action, but we can find top talent in a variety of industries to help us along the way.

(modernconsensus.com) Modern Consensus was on the ground in Berlin forÂ BlockShow, a two-day festival boasting thousands of attendees, each one there to expand their understanding of blockchain technology and meet some A-list crypto-players.Between the public on-stage panels and the private conversations we had with attendees, one theme cropped up consistently: it\u2019s hard to acquire the talent and human resources necessary to take a large or small company into the new blockchain-enabled future. We know the song all the crypto-kids sing: blockchain technology isn\u2019t just about powering bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s a \u201cnew internet\u201d setting a higher standard for how information moves and is validated around the world. This stuff isn\u2019t even ten years old yet; this new internet is in its dial-up phase. But that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t wisened experts out there. Most of them just happen to be too busy to go to work on someone else\u2019s project. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to recruit top blockchain talent at the moment because most experts prefer to do their own ICO, or set up a consultancy to better leverage their knowledge and share it with a series of clients,\u201d said Antoine Verdon, founder of Swiss blockchain company Proxeus. In simplest terms, the blockchain\u2019s existing pros mostly want to work for themselves. This sentiment is backed up by Marc P. Bernegger, a member of the \u201cblockchain task force\u201d that advises the Swiss economics minister on all things crypto. \u201cSome of the smartest blockchain people have been in the space for quite a long time and became financially independent from their digital asset holdings,\u201d he said. \u201cThey get to do just what they want, and are not forced to work for others because of money. \u201dThis situation is bound to change. As blockchain technology goes more mainstream, there will be an influx of widespread public interest (beyond all-caps \u201cbitcoin\u201d headlines) and savvy workers ready to handle crypto tasks. \u201cWe will hopefully see emergent products that reduce the technical hurdles to harness blockchain, and let employees focus on improving and carrying out business processes,\u201d said Verdon. His comment can be interpreted as a subtle plug for his companyÂ Proxeus, which provides companies with a figurative blockchain toolbox (it\u2019s been called \u201cWordPress for blockchain\u201d in the past), letting people with no technical expertise quickly and easily create their own blockchain applications. In any event, today\u2019s pool of young computer programmers will likely shift their attention to the blockchain space, bringing all their existing expertise with them as they begin to specialize in this \u201cnew normal. \u201dTo any company looking to hire blockchain specialists, Bernegger and Verdon offer the following advice: look for people who have actually built blockchain solutions that solve real problems, then ask them to detail their solution step by step. \u201cThanks to tools like GitHub, you have far better opportunity to test the skills and the knowledge of today\u2019s tech people compared to ten years ago, and the talent pool is truly becoming global,\u201d said Bernegger. \u201cI think smart people focusing on blockchain have a very bright future.\u201d Dylan Love is an editorial consultant, contributing reporter, and fiendishly curious technology enthusiast.

(jaxenter.com) The blockchain market shows no signs of slowing down and this technology is one of the hottest skillsÂ in the freelance job market. However, according to Tom Beno andÂ Nate D\u2019Amico, blockchain skills won\u2019t matter in the immediate future. How can this technology become more accessible to developers? Let\u2019s find out! JAXenter: Blockchain developers need a far-reaching skill set which includes proficiency in software engineering, cryptography, mathematics, information security and the list goes on. How can we simplify this process in order to encourage more people to experiment with this technology? Tom Beno:Â Beyond the skills you\u2019ve mentioned, I would add that there needs to be a philosophical understanding of what solutions blockchain technology can provide. Once people can work backward from the outcome, the technology becomes the set of tools used to get there. The far-reaching skills needed can be taught and learned, but the thing that will compel people to experiment is a solution-oriented understanding of the technology\u2019s use cases in a real business. Nate D\u2019Amico:Â For end users, most of it has to do with user experience design and the applications and services that will be sitting between the users and the blockchains. To use an example, we know that users are familiar with usernames and passwords. If you lose or forget your password you just enter your email, reset or recover it and get back into your account. In the blockchain world of private and public keys, a lost key typically means an orphaned account. Providing \u201cpassword reset\u201d type UX for blockchain-based applications, while maintaining security, can go a long way. JAXenter: How can we make blockchain more accessible to developers? It\u2019s a marathon and we are just in the first couple of miles of this journey as companies understand how to map their various problems and workflows to a blockchain. Tom Beno:Â Blockchain technology can be made more accessible to developers by utilizing open APIs in the platform design. Many of the most well-known blockchains operate off their own programming languages. This creates a higher barrier to entry for talent that uses Java, C++ or Python. Nate D\u2019Amico:Â This is the essence of what we are trying to solve with our blockchain and tooling offerings. Our view is that the best way to make blockchain more accessible for users and developers is to make getting started and the development of user experience as efficient and self-serviceable as possible. The ideal is a simple object model to leverage the blockchain for varying use cases without having to worry about all the gory details of how things are working under the covers. An analogy would be that back in the day you used to have to know how database innards worked and how they were leveraging b-trees for storage and querying. But as tools like MySQL and Postgres came out, everything became more approachable and provided solid foundations to store your data with a simple SQL and query interface. JAXenter: What isÂ CatapultÂ and how can people use it to build and deploy blockchain applications more easily? Tom Beno:Â Catapult is the V2 release of the NEM protocol. As stated above, it uses an open API design to allow people to build and deploy software applications on both a public and private ledger. Catapult has been designed with features meant for real business use cases \u2013 things like aggregate transactions, recurring pulls and atomic swaps. Nate D\u2019Amico:Â Catapult is the second generation of our blockchain offering that delivers Version 2 of the NEM protocol \u2013 it powers the NEM public blockchain network. We have a \u201cbatteries included\u201d approach to everything we deliver. Whether it\u2019s in the open source solution, or our enterprise product line, at the end of the day we make it as easy and efficient for developers and users to get started. For instance, we just released an open source development bootstrap tool that will start up a running Catapult service on your laptop in about 60 seconds \u2013 all you have to do is learn the APIs and programming against your test setup. We are also delivering a self-service developer lab running on various public clouds. This will allow developers a push button experience to get a free starter Catapult service going. Outside of tools like this, it\u2019s really the power of the NEM protocol in its simplicity and minimal object model, while providing extremely powerful on chain contracts for asset management, namespacing and the most advanced multi-signature account support. Developers don\u2019t have to write any contracts themselves, they just need to leverage the direct API calls like they would with any other REST API service. SEE ALSO:Â \u201cWe are working hard to cultivate blockchain talent\u201d Blockchain and DevOps JAXenter: Right now we perceive blockchain and DevOps as two different terms used in different contexts. But do they do well together? Do they have a shared future?Â  Nate D\u2019Amico:Â Definitely. There are two parts to that, one is how DevOps practices and tooling can make it more approachable and easy for companies and developers to get started delivering and maintaining distributed ledger solutions in production, at scale. The other part is how the practice of DevOps itself can leverage blockchain distributed-ledger technology its tooling and solutions. For the former, as mentioned above, we strive for ease of deployment and self-service, so everything we do is approached with a goal of 100% automation and removing setup and configuration complexity from the end user. For the latter, we have a partner that has a DevOps related solution for the enterprise that is leveraging Catapult in its core for powering various features and security in its solution. JAXenter: Do you think developers\u2019 lack of blockchain skills will no longer matter in the foreseeable future? Nate D\u2019Amico:Â Yes! It won\u2019t matter in the immediate future. That is our job and what keeps us up at night, besides working between EU and Japan time zones. We tell customers regularly, \u201cYou don\u2019t need a blockchain developer, you need a regular developer who knows how to use SDK\u2019s and talk to APIs, just like any of the other 20 services you are using.\u201d JAXenter: Has it become easier to include blockchain in a company\u2019s backbone? Nate D\u2019Amico:Â It has. Catapult and other models out there are offering a BaaS (Blockchain-as-a-Service) so that companies can get a private blockchain environment established.It has but it\u2019s still the early days. It has a similar feel to the \u201cbig data\u201d space, where every company had a big data initiative. It\u2019s a marathon and we are just in the first couple of miles of this journey as companies understand how to map their various problems and workflows to a blockchain. It\u2019s our job to accelerate that process and make it as easy and approachable as possible. JAXenter: What are the new areas in which blockchain is likely to be used this year? Nate D\u2019Amico:Â There are some obvious ones that are already happening, at least in POC and pilot projects around the world. Most of them are on the enterprise side and have an auditing and reporting focus to them, such as logistic data logging, IoT sensor reporting, identity and access control status and, of course, tokens \u2013 whether publicly tradable cryptographic tokens, or private use ones used to track a level of asset ownership and reporting. These will continue to be the primary solutions, but I think we will start to see more B2C type solutions going into production. Those can be loyalty rewards type solutions, payments or security and verification. As more people get pulled into the space, the breadth of solutions should continue to expand. Thank you!Â  We want YOU!Â  We are looking for proposals for ourÂ Blockchain Technology Conference 2018Â in Berlin, Germany. TheÂ Call for PapersÂ is open and we want to see you on the panel of speakers. The deadline for pitch submissions is June 11th; what are you waiting for?

(coindesk.com) NEWS Nikhilesh DeÂ Â Â  Technology giant IBM is hiring nearly 2,000 people in France - and many of them will be focusing on blockchain technology, chief executive Virginia Rometty said Wednesday.In an interview with French news organizationÂ Le Monde, Rometty said IBM was hiring researchers for blockchain projects, among other focuses. While she did not elaborate on what projects the researchers may be working on, she did note that the company currently works withÂ CrÃ©dit Mutuel, Orange Bank, Generali, France's national railway system andÂ MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (LVMH).During the interview, she said: \"In the next two years, we will hire 1,800 people in France at IBM. In January, we announced a project to recruit 400 people for research. These jobs will include AI, blockchain ... and the Internet of Things.\" The move is just the latest in IBM's push to expand its blockchain research. Last week atÂ CoinDesk's Consensus 2018Â conference, the company announced it was partnering with environmental technology startup Veridium Labs to create a carbon credit token on the Stellar network. Stepping back, the company has recently announced efforts to tackleÂ advertising,Â humanitarian aid,Â business registriesÂ and evenÂ insurance, as previously reported by CoinDesk.

Their success has unparalleled with anything in the stratosphere, yet they\u2019re still receiving offers with compensation packages rivaling that of CEO pay packages. And many of them have already become millionaires from investing in the coins of the market leaders they helped to build, including bitcoin and Ethereum, which means they\u2019re less incentivized to join other projects for the size of the offer alone. // -- Discuss and ask questions in ourÂ community on Workplace. Decentralized World The thing to remember about blockchain pioneers is that they set out on the mission of a decentralized world not so that they could be subject to the whims of cryptocurrency prices. They are just as focused on the social impact of the blockchain as they are the success of their respective projects. Consider Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin, who during the peak of the cryptocurrency market rally at year-end 2017 tweeted the following reminder to his followers \u2013 *All* crypto communities, ethereum included, should heed these words of warning. Need to differentiate between getting hundreds of billions of dollars of digital paper wealth sloshing around and actually achieving something meaningful for society.Â  https://t.co/aNpEnBNGsA\u2014 Vitalik \"Not giving away ETH\" Buterin (@VitalikButerin)Â December 27, 2017 Buterin went on to use Venezuela as an example, whose economy is in tatters. He was dismayed that bitcoin\u2019s price posts were getting more traction than \u201chow Venezuelans were being rescued by crypto.\u201d // -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD.Â  Click here to change your current membership-- // If the corporate culture reflected Buterin\u2019s mission rather than dangling a six- or seven-digit compensation package in front of recruits, they might have more success attracting top blockchain talent. Talent Battle Meanwhile, blockchain startups are creating roadmaps with product release dates obligating them to have top development talent in-house, all of which is leading toÂ projects getting stuck and helping to fuel the hiring frenzy.Â It\u2019s not solely blockchain startups, however. Global corporations including certain FANG stocks are no longer waiting on the sidelines as ICOs raise billions of dollars and the cryptocurrency market cap has balloons to nearly $400 billion, all of which has placed a high bounty on the pool for blockchain talent. If you have any doubts, consider again Ethereum co-founder Buterin. As Hacked.comÂ previously reported, Buterin tweeted about having received a job offer from Google. David Schwartz,Â whose Twitter profileÂ describes him as \u201cone of the original architects of the XRP network,\u201dÂ told The Wall Street JournalÂ how both a startup and a big tech play attempted to poach one of his team members, each of them offering the Ripple developer a million dollar signing bonus. Meanwhile, the blockchain, a public immutable ledger where transactions are recorded and joined together in individual blocks, has become a catchphrase, one that can mean the difference between hits on a LinkedIn profile or not. According to theÂ JournalÂ story, there are thousands of available jobs posted on the social platform hunting blockchain talent through the early part of May, reflecting more than a 150% jump versus all of last year. But just as regulators have said they don\u2019t want to rush into crafting any policy in response to market performance, employers should similarly take a step back before throwing everything but kitchen sinks out to software developers. Some companies are developing talent in-house, which is another route to consider. But overall, hiring companies could be much more effective at recruitingÂ blockchain talent if they understood the mission behind decentralization. Featured image courtesy of Shutterstock.
