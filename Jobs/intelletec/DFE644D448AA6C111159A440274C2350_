They have developed a Q&A platform where online communities can come together to have discussions about whatever topic that interests them! About the Team: Their Designers are thoughtful generalist who leverage what they learn about psychological and social dynamics, communities and networks, and systems and policy design, in addition to more typical design skills. Product design plays a significant role in product strategy and direction (their VP of Design reports directly to their CEO). The Product Design team works on everything from ranking to UI, from internationalization to moderation systems.

About the Role: As a Product Design Manager, you will lead a team of scrappy and driven product designers who own the entire design process from start to finish.
