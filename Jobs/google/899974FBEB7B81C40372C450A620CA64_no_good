You have to find a 2g or 3g sims card for the device which I found to be difficult by going to the stores to purchase (may be easier ordering online). May be a good device for others but didn't suit me personally. Delivery time was amazing however. PHABLET âââââEvelynÂ· Review provided by walmart.com Â· March 4, 2017 Luv the concept BUT no one knows anything about this device. Not compatible with most providers. Little booklet print is sooooo miniscule can't read it. Only 1 speaker so had 2buy an earpiece. Good price $93with cover struggling but will persevere as I wanted a big screen...this is 7\". Also need 2b HOUDINI 2open up 2insert SIM. Phew!!!! Not worth it! âââââChipÂ· Review provided by walmart.com Â· November 11, 2016 Calls & Texts dropped. Runs slow on mobile data then completely stops running the mobile data. This is due to the fact that \"phablets\" aren't very good for running on mobile data at all, I wish I knew this before purchase. It may say compatible with 'T-mobile' & 'AT&T' but it is not. You will get a T-mobile agent to activate it but they'll warn you of the connection issues if they're honest and not just scrambling around to get your account set up to their service. I Regret Buying This âââââlden97731Â· Review provided by walmart.com Â· September 18, 2019 Sometimes the phone will turn on but most of the time it doesn't. Very disappointed.
