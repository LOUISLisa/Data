Some people have invested in them, while others have watched in confusion, not sure what it all means. Kyle Michaud admirably takes on the task of unraveling the complexities, taking us through the history of Bitcoin\u2019s beginnings before delving into Blockchain\u2019s great potential as a distributed decentralized database to change the current third-party paradigm when it comes to everything from healthcare to banking to car sales. You won\u2019t find a clearer explanation for Blockchain anywhere, nor a more practical guide in terms of how it can concretely be applied to your everyday life.
