I paired it with a RST silver visor, and it looks great with my gear setup. Handles fog well, noise level is good, and it has some nice features like speaker pockets and ear plug holders. The downside to this helmet is the fit. It's extremely narrow, which means you'll probably have to size up the cheekpads to help with the fit. For example, if an L fits you well front to back but is difficult to get on/off, buy XL cheekpads. I fit great in an HJC L and I needed an XL for the Airflite. The shell sizes are also limited, meaning my XL features the biggest shell, and makes my head look bigger. Small âââââShawnÂ· Review provided by revzilla.com Â· March 28, 2019 Likes: Look Dislikes: Very small. I measure an exact 24\", which is on the low end of an XL size. This is so extremely tight that it nearly tears my ears off when going on. I recommend ordering the next size larger. Internal \"wells\" for ear pieces are far back, and nearly behind the top back of your ear. The design needs to be changed, will not work well with installed head gear unless you plan to break out the dremel and really cut into the helmet. If using the mouth/chin guard...good luck putting on the helmet. Better to put the helmet on and then put in the lower chin guard. Better yet, just get a nylon or poly velco wrap around to protect the lower part of your face/neck if riding in cold weather. Tinted installed eye shield does not come down far enough, and the nose cut-out on it interrupts view. Better to remove it. Anti-fog coating really doesn't work. Fogs up whenever sitting still. Not sure if the additional tinted faceshield I ordered is as bad (not labelled as anti-fog). For the price, I honestly expected much better. I would say you are better off spending either much less, or much more. I have been riding for 35 years, and wearing helmets for just as long. Great quality and features âââââAÂ· Review provided by revzilla.com Â· October 24, 2019 The helmet is stunning and more beautiful in person, the pictures just don't do it justice. The drop down sun visor works great and the slider for it has a nice feel and quality to it. The airflow is optimal as advertised which is great on hot Florida days when I'm out riding. I ordered this helmet along with a pair of icon gloves and revilla shipped them to me for free in two days as promised and gave me personal tracking updates via email and txt message as stated and was spot on. Both items showed up brand new in packaging as promised and my experience thus far is 10/10. I would recommend this product and revilla to anyone who cares about their experience start to finish. Quality products and quality service, ride safe! Not scratch resistant shields âââââLemontÂ· Review provided by cyclegear.com Â· March 23, 2020 Had to buy the shield I wanted vs what was advertised. When I bought it at their expensive price the shield got scratched the same day I used it. So that was money wasted. Other than the shield being not scratch resistant and expensive the helmet is pretty good. But those two flaws of the helmet mentioned above turns a great helmet in to a ok helmet. I'm still disappointed about the scratched face shield. I'm lucky I bought two but at this point knowing how easy it is to scratch I dont want to install the other one. I am going to refund my money back on it if they let me. Showing results 1\u20134 of 40 Next >"
