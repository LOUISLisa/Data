Overall, helmet looks good. With the dark smoke or Silver RST visor, looks even better. I originally ordered a size 2xl, but it was too tight to get my prescription glasses on (I'm near sighted). Exchanged it for a 3xl and it fit. Odd thing with Icon, I seem to have buy a size larger with them. Plenty of space for wired or wireless earbuds in the helmet. Helmet is nice and quiet, much more than my old HJC. Taking the helmet off will probably be painful, regardless of your size. Kinda have to wiggle it around when putting it on to get your ears in snug. Other than that, it's a great looking helmet, no pressure points once it's on, and good airflow and sound dampening. Wish there was a tiny bit more room in the ear cups for glasses, but, it still gets a pass. My personal experience with Icon helmets. âââââSpencerÂ· Review provided by revzilla.com Â· July 5, 2019 Considering I have crash landed on an airflite helmet before and it kept me completely safe, I highly recommend this Icon product! With its long and futuristic visor that covers your whole face any debris gets blocked and keeps you very protected! The interior they use is very comfortable and soft to the touch! There are a few ventilation holes on the top and front of the mouth that let in just enough fresh air to breath well and easy while splitting lanes! Icon always has some of the best painted helmets that don\u2019t break the bank. Feels good, looks good âââââJeffreyÂ· Review provided by revzilla.com Â· March 21, 2019 The air flite helmet by icon is a great helmet. They have a great selection on colors and designs. It fits a little tight when you first start putting it on, but once you get past your ears it feels spot on. Airflow is nice and not to much wind noise especially with ear plugs and Bluetooth speakers. That face shield turns heads every time I ride. For the price and quality of helmet it is I think it\u2019s a great choice. Love this helmet âââââPatrickÂ· Review provided by revzilla.com Â· October 24, 2019 Researched a ton of different helmets and Icon is the one that stood out the most. Great variety of product and customization. Switching the face shield is an ease and quick. Fits perfectly on my head and with the vent system never break a sweat in my helmet even on hot days.
