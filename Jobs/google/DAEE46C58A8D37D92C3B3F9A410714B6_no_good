I wholeheartedly contribute this helmet to saving my life, because the image of this helmet that is saved on my phone indicates that I would have lost half of my face and part of my head had I not been wearing a helmet (which is illegal anyways in most states, I believe.) This was the very first helmet I bought when I started riding and even though it shouldn't be used now (helmets are typically only effective after one impact), I'll definitely keep it as a memory. Anyways, I'll go over some Pros and Cons with side-notes: Pros: 1) Great Vision [I only own one other helmet so I obviously cannot attest to the vision on other helmets.] 2) Airflow is Substantial [Plenty of vents] 3) Faceshields are fairly easy to swap out [Wide assortment of shields available too] 4) Great Design [I've received numerous compliments on the look of the helmet since I've owned it (Black Construct)] 5) Very Durable [The faceshield looks like Jabba The Hutt's skidmarks after the crash, but I could easily replace it. The rest of the helmet has some various scratches around, but nothing is broken on it except for the faceshield lock. More on that later.] Cons: 1) May be a little tight out-of-the-box [The padding never fully adjusted around my head/face. I ended up actually purchasing the MD/Loose helmet liner which increased the comfort. Your results may vary.] 2) Speaker pockets are very shallow [I ran a Sena 20s on this helmet and the speakers pockets are not deep enough to properly accommodate the speakers. I would often have some pressure against my ears during long rides because of this. I suppose if you got surgical with it you could make it work better.] 3) Chin/Side curtain can and probably will cause issues when attaching a communications unit (Sena, etc.) [The lip around the side of the helmet is angled in such a way that using one of the mount units with something like a Sena 20s can cause some issues properly attaching the unit to your helmet. I made it work, but I had to mount the unit to slightly back on the left side of my helmet. For a while this also led to issues with the unit properly making contact with all the mount pins, thus leading to audio coming out of only one speaker.] 4) Faceshield locking mechanism is not ideal at all [If you look closely at the images of the front of the helmet, you will notice a little \"pin\" that protrudes from the front of the helmet. This is where the faceshield literally slides over and locks into place. The problem is it takes more force than necessary to lift the faceshield OUT of the pin, just because ICON decided to use this completely idiotic design for faceshield closure. For some reason, they use this garbage on many of their helmet models from what I've seen. This, in my opinion, is the single, worst component of this helmet. So much so, the faceshield actually cracked in half at this point when I crashed because it literally split it out of the pin and evidently ripped the pin off as well. While it may sound like an extensive list of cons, this helmet is great, but has some issues (some of which may be nitpicky.) Please keep in mind that this review comes after almost 3 years of ownership. I went through an experience with this helmet. If you can take away anything from this review - all I can say is that it saved my life. And for that, I am grateful. very cool helmet âââââgregÂ· Review provided by revzilla.com Â· September 16, 2018 I got this for my wife who was having a hard time finding the right fit. The long oval fit made all the difference. She is an extra small and the helmet feels very light in my hands. I think this thing looks great (so does she). We got the white/clear. You can see the sheets of fiber glass and the lines of the back neck cut out looks amazing. It does not have as much of the brown shading that the photo shows, which is a good thing, it looks clean. The one thing we don't like is pink lock for the shield, you have to bend the shield over the pin. Overall, happy and one of the best looking helmets I've seen. Good but not great âââââRobertÂ· Review provided by revzilla.com Â· June 26, 2017 Purchased this helmet from a local store but since this is a much wider used site my review will be better served here. I purchased the black construct Icon Airframe Pro here are some of my thoughts. Graphics/sizing/shape Icon apparently runs slightly small (at least in my experience) I would normally wear a size L but the XL is what fit me. Because of this the helmet looked bulbus on my shoulders which diminished my interest. All of the pictures I've seen of this graphic makes it look awesome, but they must all have used the same helmet that was special made because the graphic was disappointing. It scratches really easy and the underlying structure really doesn't look great. The shape is interesting and would look great if I was able to get the smaller shell size but alas I could not. Features: I found the lock on the visor to be awful, it was way to stiff/difficult to operate with one hand and even closing the visor was a problem. I didn't ride with the helmet on (planned on returning it) but wearing it around my house it was no quieter than wearing a baseball cap. It didn't seem to seal around the visor either. lastly it does not come with a pinlock ready and its not even an option for replacement lenses. The liner is comfortable though and seems to be well made. Conclusions: It is a nice helmet with some drawbacks. for this price point I would definitely purchase a different helmet from a more established brand. I ended up returning the helmet and spending a little more for a Shoei to get more value out of my money. Very nice helmet. Good quality. Fit is small âââââB52 flashÂ· Review provided by fortnine.ca Â· March 26, 2020 I ordered the xxxl size. It fits very tight. Almost to being unusable. Icon sells different liner thicknesses but don\u2019t have the thinner pads for the xxxl. I think the smallish fit is the nature of icon helmets as this is my second icon and that one fit smallish too Showing results 1\u20134 of 48 Next >"
