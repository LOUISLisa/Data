One thing about the device I can complain about is it has a tiny missing screen on the top of the device underneath the glass. It doesn't affect what's on the screen :/ I'm 100% sure it wasn't my fault. That's the first thing i noticed when I took off the plastic cover. The good thing is, it doesn't obscure anything in the screen. It's on the \"unused\" gap of the screen. I don't want to return it because i don't want to wait another week or two, which is reasonable time in where I live from where it's delivered. I don't know if i should return it but I think I will to get a replacement. The delivery was surprisingly fast. Everything else is perfect; I love this smartphone. The colours are insanely vivid, sound is clear and full, the screen very bright, it doesn't overheat at all, it's incredibly fast. XZ1 smartphone is undoubtedly the most underrated smartphone; it's an absolute shame :/. Lovely smartphone I can't stress enough how much I love this phone. It's literally perfect. Sony... they have really impressed me with Xperia Z5 Premium and now they have outdone themselves on this phone. It keeps getting better. hi âââââradicalpassiontruth4Â· Review provided by ebay.com Â· June 27, 2017 We sell electronic products Very low price PayPal payment! yuhky ( c o m ) Y9 prime exelente celular âââââ Â· March 24, 2020 Hola buenos dias mira yo octe por sacarlo por plan y no me arriepiento como e tenidos otros modelos no como la calidad del Y9 prime la vercion anterior no es muy buena tengo q decirlo pero este modelo que saco que es prime no tengo nada q decir la camara es muy buena para los juegos q estan de moda no se pega corre bn los felicitos Excelente celular rÃ¡pido y Ãºtil âââââ Â· March 24, 2020 Impecable saca buenas fotos, es rÃ¡pido y posee arta memoria 100% recomendable Showing results 1\u20134 of 23 Next >"
