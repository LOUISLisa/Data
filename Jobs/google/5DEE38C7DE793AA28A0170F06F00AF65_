What leads countries rapidly initiate blockchain projects? I argue that it is because blockchain is a technology directly related to social organization; Unlike other technologies, a consensus mechanism form the core of blockchain. Traditionally, consensus is not the domain of machines but rather humankind. However, blockchain operates through a consensus algorithm with human intervention; once that consensus is made, it cannot be modified or forged. Through utilization of Lawrence Lessig's proposition that \"Code is law,\" I suggest that blockchain creates \"absolute law\" that cannot be violated. This characteristic of blockchain makes it possible to implement social technology that can replace existing social apparatuses including bureaucracy. Government is a social technology that exists through social consensus, serving to ensure trust among anonymous individuals in an expanded community; likewise the blockchain, though varying in its nature as a physical-social technology, is specifically designed to ensure trust among anonymous individuals. When we investigate the functions of government in detail, various devices for providing trust to society operate in various areas and at various levels. In terms of ensuring trust, governments have many different ways of performing the same role. The newly developed technology of the blockchain is revolutionary in offering the first ever mechanism to ensure trust. In summary, there are three close similarities between blockchain and bureaucracy. First, both of them are defined by the rules and execute predetermined rules. Second, both of them work as information processing machines for society. Third, both of them work as trust machines for society. Therefore, I posit that it is possible and moreover unavoidable to replace bureaucracy with blockchain systems. In conclusion, I suggest five principles that should be adhered to when we replace bureaucracy with the blockchain system: 1) introducing Blockchain Statute law; 2) transparent disclosure of data and source code; 3) implementing autonomous executing administration; 4) building a governance system based on direct democracy and 5) making Distributed Autonomous Government(DAG).
