Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World Don Tapscott, Alex Tapscott Penguin, May 10, 2016 - Technology & Engineering - 384 pages 14 Reviews Blockchain technology is powering our future. As the technology behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Facebook's Libra, open software platforms like Ethereum, and disruptive companies like Ripple, it\u2019s too important to ignore. ???????????? In this revelatory book, Don Tapscott, the bestselling author of????????????Wikinomics, and his son, blockchain expert Alex Tapscott, bring us a brilliantly researched, highly readable, and essential book about the technology driving the future of the economy.???????????? ???????????? Blockchain is the ingeniously simple, revolution????????????ary protocol that allows transactions to be simultaneously anonymous and secure by maintaining a tamperproof public ledger of value. Though it\u2019s best known as the technology that drives bitcoin and other digital cur????????????rencies, it also has the potential to go far beyond currency, to record virtually everything of value to humankind, from birth and death certifi????????????cates to insurance claims, land titles, and even votes.???????????? ???????????? Blockchain is also essential to understand if you\u2019re an artist who wants to make a living off your art, a consumer who wants to know where that hamburger meat really came from, an immigrant who\u2019s tired of paying big fees to send money home to your loved ones, or an entrepreneur looking for a new platform to build a business.????????????And those examples are barely the tip of the iceberg. ???????????? As with major paradigm shifts that preceded it, blockchain technology will create winners and losers. This book shines a light on where it can lead us in the next decade and beyond. ????????????
