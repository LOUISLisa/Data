Fast shipping and top notch customer service makes this the only place I will get my gear from. Now on to the review. I just received my airflite helmet with the red rst face shield today and rode around for about 4 hours. Its a tight squeeze to get on and off however it's extremely comfortable when riding. My only complaint with the fit is that it's SO TIGHT when removing it it almost rips my ears off, though maybe after the break in period this will get better. For airflow, I rated it a 3 as it really doesn't have all to much when the integrated sun visor is up as it blocks all airflow from the forehead vents. When the sv is down the airflow is pretty good however it kind of sucks that if I'm hot I have to use the sv. Other than those 2 things I absolutely love this helmet. Best all around helmet I've ever own âââââChristopherÂ· Review provided by revzilla.com Â· July 7, 2019 So i have bought/used a dozen (cheap) helmets over the years and i resolved to finally pony up some cash for a decent helmet. After days and days of research and watching every revzilla breakdown video i narrowed it down to 3 helmets (in fav. Style order): 1.Simpson, 2. AVG, and 3. Icon. Then i started reading reviews and quickly ruled out the Simpson and AVG. I was almost skeptical about the Icon having overwhelmingly good reviews, but once i actually tried ob the Airflight, i knew what the rave was about. This helmet fits like a glove, doesn't move at all, even when head checking. It has never fogged up, and doesn't even feel hot when stopped at a light in 100deg heat. It's a great helmet all around, and has an awesome look Good Value Helmet with Secondary Sun Visor âââââNormanÂ· Review provided by revzilla.com Â· October 4, 2019 I purchased a white version of this helmet and have no complaints. When I first tried it on as others have said it is tight around the ears for sure. But after 3-4 times of wearing it I have had no problems. The fit is very comfortable and the helmet is light. I am a fan of Icon - an affordable brand that seems to offer great protection for excellent value. I am a big fan of the internal sun visor - much better than wondering where your sun glasses are when you have this secondary visor and it is very easy to operate even with a gloved hand. Great helmet and great service from Revzilla. Attention getter. âââââEricÂ· Review provided by revzilla.com Â· November 3, 2019 Glad I choose this as my first helmet ever being a new rider. Its got good air flow but it seems to collect a bit of condensation when in use. So I have to keep a small extra microfiber towel with me at all times with me to wipe off the fog and condensation inside the helmet. I've gotten way too many stares wearing this. But thats what this helmet does. People often say if Im some sort of an astronaut or alien creature. Got this helmet with the RST gold face shield. It definetly turns a lot of heads.
