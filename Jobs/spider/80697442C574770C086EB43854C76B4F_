The study has been released on October 18 and shows an increased interest amid a bear market in the cryptocurrency space. In order to provide this data, Glassdoor examined U.S. jobs posting on their site that have the word Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency. At the same time, the company decided to include salary estimation with its \u2018Know Your Worth\u2019 instrument. According to the company, there were 1,775 blockchain-related jobs in the United States. That represents an increase of 300 per cent year-over-year. The locations with the highest number of job positions related to cryptocurrencies were New York City, San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle. The most important blockchain roles searched for are related to analyst relations manager, product manager, risk analyst and marketing manager. Traders and investment analysts were not the most important positions requested. There are some companies that have several job openings including ConsenSys and IBM. Coinbase, Kraken and Oracle have also an important number of specialists requested. However, Facebook, Google and Apple were the most important absences. These companies usually lead the market with innovative technologies, but it seems that this time they are a few steps behind. The median salary of the blockchain field revealed by Glassdoor is almost $85,000 dollars, 62% higher than the US median salary, close to $52,500 dollars per year. The salaries ranged from $36,046 o $223,667 per year. These high salaries are related to the fact that most of them are explained by the location. In general, the cities where the jobs are located require higher salaries because they are much more expensive than other cities. Australia, India, Singapore and other countries are also registering an increased interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency experts. The world is moving towards new technologies, but the number of specialists is still limited. Just a few months and years ago Universities started to provide professional courses about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. In the future, when the market will be more mature, the number of professionals is expected to grow as well.
