Jordan Tuwiner Founder, Buy Bitcoin Worldwide When is the Right Time to Buy? As with any market, nothing is for sure. Bitcoin is traded 24/7 and its price changes every second. Bitcoin's price in US dollars during 2015 and 2016. It's impossible to say when to buy. Use tools like our Bitcoin price chart to analyze charts from other Bitcoin trading sites. These charts will help you understand Bitcoin\u2019s price history across the many global Bitcoin exchanges. Why Does Buying Bitcoin Take So Long? Long wait times are usually a problem with existing payment systems, not with Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin transactions only take about 10 minutes to confirm. Bank transfers in the U.S., for example, can take up to five days to complete. Bitcoin transactions can be confirmed as quickly as 10 minutes; it\u2019s rare to experience a delay longer than one hour. This means that a merchant can\u2019t release bitcoins to a customer until five days have passed unless they're willing to take on risk. Can You Sell Bitcoins? Yes, of course! Most exchanges that let you buy bitcoins also let you sell (for a fee of course). If you don't want to sell bitcoins, you can also spend them. While you can't incorporate a company with Bitcoin yet, you can spend it lots of other places. Why Do I Need to Upload my ID for Some Exchanges? This is due to Know Your Customer (KYC) laws which require exchanges to record the real world identity of their clients. Can Anyone Buy Bitcoin? Bitcoin requires no permission to use or buy. You will have to check the legality of Bitcoin in your country. In most countries Bitcoin is legal! Should I Buy Physical Bitcoins? A physical bitcoin for sale. Source Physical bitcoins are physical, metal coins with a Bitcoin private key embedded inside. We recommend that you stay away from physical bitcoins unless you\u2019re a numismatist. While physical coins sound like a good idea, they force you to trust the honesty of the creator of the coin. The creator could create two copies of the private key. Unless you immediately open and withdraw the digital bitcoins from your physical bitcoin, the creator could at any time steal the funds it contains. Can I Buy Partial Bitcoins? Yes, of course! Each bitcoin is divisible to the 8th decimal place, meaning each bitcoin can be split into 100,000,000 pieces. Each unit of bitcoin, or 0.00000001 bitcoin, is called a satoshi. Most exchanges let you buy as little as $5 worth of bitcoins at a time. Why Should I Buy Bitcoin Instead of Mining? A long time ago anyone could mine bitcoins on their computer at home. Today, only specialized computer hardware is powerful enough to do this. Think about it like this: Should you buy gold or mine gold? Well, to mine gold you need big powerful machines, a lot of time, and money to buy the machinery. This is why most people just purchase gold online or from a broker. So Bitcoin is no different. You should just buy some if you want coins without trying to mine. Do I need a Bitcoin Account Before Buying? With Bitcoin, there are not really accounts. Instead, you should have a Bitcoin wallet. If you want to store bitcoins, then a wallet is where you keep them. In Bitcoin these wallets are not called an account but a wallet functions almost the same way. The only difference is you are responsible for the security if your wallet rather than placing the security in the hands of a bank or trust. How do I check if I received a Bitcoin payment? You can check in a Bitcoin block explorer like Smartbit. Why Would Someone Even Want to Buy Bitcoins? There are many reasons people want to own bitcoins. Many people like to purchase some and put them to the side in the hopes that they will be worth more in the future. Many people are using bitcoins to remit money to their families from out of the country. Right now, Bitcoin is one of the cheapest ways to do this. People also use Bitcoin to buy stuff online. Big companies like Microsoft, Dell, Newegg and Overstock all accept bitcoins. Bitcoin is also very unique compared to other markets in that it trades 24 hours a day and never stops. Most stock markets only open on weekdays from 9 AM to 5 PM. So many traders buy and sell bitcoins because it is a fun and fast market to trade. Can I Buy Bitcoin Stock? Bitcoin itself is not a stock despite it functioning somewhat like one. You can\u2019t buy bitcoins through a traditional stock fund and instead have to buy bitcoins yourself. This may change in the future if a Bitcoin ETF ever gets approved. What Happens When you Purchase Bitcoins? Bitcoins are actually just secret digital codes. When you buy bitcoins, the seller is using a wallet to transfer the ownership of the coins to you. Once your purchase is complete, the codes are now owned by you and not the seller. Why Are the Chinese Buying So Much BTC? It seems the Chinese really like Bitcoin\u2019s properties such as its sound monetary policy and that it can be used anywhere in the world. Bitcoin's volatility also makes it interesting for speculative traders. Is Bitcoin Legal? Bitcoin is legal in nearly every country. Only a few countries have actually banned the use of bitcoins. Before you buy, make sure you double-check the legal status of Bitcoin in your country. Why do I need to buy bitcoins before buying most altcoins? Bitcoin functions as the \"reserve\" currency of cryptocurrency. So it is very hard to buy other coins without first buying bitcoins. Once you purchase the bitcoins you can convert the bitcoins into other cryptocoins. This is mostly because Bitcoin has very good liquidity and is traded on every cryptocurrency exchange. So most coins are traded against Bitcoin rather than the US dollar or other fiat currencies. Am I Anonymous when I Buy? Bitcoin is not anonymous but rather pseudonymous. All Bitcoin transactions are public but it is not always known the real identity behind any given Bitcoin address. Can I use Multiple Exchanges? If the limits on one exchange are to low you can simply open an account with another exchange to give yourself the ability to buy more. You can signup, join, and use as many Bitcoin exchanges as you want that are available in your country. Do I need to Pay Taxes on Bitcoin? In most countries you will need to pay some kind of tax if you buy bitcoins, sell them, and make a gain. In the US you must do this on every transaction. Be sure to check with your country\u2019s tax authorities to make sure you are paying all the required taxes on your bitcoin use. What Other Ways can I Get Bitcoins Besides Buying? Just like any other form of money, you can get bitcoins by requesting from your employer to be paid in bitcoins. What Is the Supply of Bitcoins? The supply of Bitcoin is fixed. There can never be more than 21 million -- and there are about 17.3 million right now. Every 4 years, the bitcoin halving happens where the new supply rate is cut in half. What's up with the Bitcoin price? This is the question everyone is asking. No one knows! It's now been 400+ days since Bitcoin hit an all-time high. The previous high was over 1,000 days. The good thing is, developers are hard at work to make Bitcoin the best money the world has ever seen. Chapter 5 Avoiding Bitcoin Scams: Don't Lose Money! I've been using Bitcoin for 3+ years. I've never fallen victim to a single scam. Follow the tips explained here and you'll greatly reduce your chances of losing money. Jordan Tuwiner Founder, Buy Bitcoin Worldwide There are many scams related to Bitcoin. Scammers target new Bitcoiners and less tech-savvy users. Follow these basic rules in order to avoid Bitcoin scams: Research Study your intended exchange and make sure it\u2019s trustworthy. Search forums like Reddit for the experiences of other users. You can also use our Bitcoin exchange reviews to get in depth information about certain exchanges. If you don\u2019t find your intended exchange listed on this site, extra caution and research is advised as it may be a scam! Check Ratings If you\u2019re using a peer-to-peer exchange like LocalBitcoins or Wall of Coins, check the seller\u2019s feedback. If most of their feedback is positive, your trade is more likely to go through without issues. If a seller has lots of negative feedback, it\u2019s best to simply stay away and find a more reliable seller. Use Escrow Many scammers will try an approach like this: \u201cSend me bitcoins, and once I get the bitcoins I\u2019ll pay you on PayPal!\u201d Don\u2019t ever agree to a trade like this. Bitcoin payments are irreversible, so if you send first the scammer can simply not pay you and keep their bitcoins. PayPal can't force the scammer to pay either, due to the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin which doesn\u2019t record the identity of a payment\u2019s sender or recipient. This would leave you with no way to get your bitcoins back. Stay Away from Bitcoin investments Any service that claims to pay interest on bitcoins or increase your bitcoins is likely extremely risky or an outright scam. If it sounds too good to be true, stay away. Be Careful with Altcoins What are altcoins? Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. Altcoins are traded globally on hundreds of exchanges. Avoid throwing money into coins which are experiencing a sudden and dramatic spike in price and volume. Such moves, especially in insignificant coins with otherwise thin volume and flat price action, are likely to crash fast. Chapter 6 Secure your Coins Don't store coins on Bitcoin exchanges! Bitcoin users have lost over $1 billion worth of bitcoins in exchange hacks and scams. Jordan Tuwiner Founder, Buy Bitcoin Worldwide Your bitcoins are only safe if you store them in a wallet that is controlled by YOU! Here are two examples where users got screwed by leaving bitcoins with a third party: Bitfinex hack where users lost $70 million Mt Gox where users lost $450 million or more So, do yourself a favor: Get yourself a Bitcoin wallet and control your own coins. For large amounts of bitcoins, we recommend cryptocurrency & Bitcoin hardware wallets. Hardware wallets are small, offline devices that store your bitcoins offline and out of reach from hackers and malware. Why? It's pretty simple: Hardware wallets are the easiest way to securely store bitcoins and easy to backup Less margin for error; setup is easy even for less technical users Check out the Bitcoin hardware wallet comparison chart below: Wallet Screen Released Price Buy Ledger Nano X 2019 $119 Ledger Nano S 2016 $59 TREZOR T 2018 $165 TREZOR One 2013 $78 Data Bitcoin Price History Bitcoin Volatility Index Mayer Multiple How Many BTC Quick Links Sitemap Bitcoin Wallets Exchanges Bitcoin Halving Site ",
