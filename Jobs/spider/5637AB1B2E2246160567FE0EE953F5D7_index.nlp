Contact us team@propsproject.com Legal Disclaimer: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has qualified the offering statement that we have filed with the SEC. The information in that offering statement is more complete than the information we are providing now, and could differ in important ways. You must read the documents filed with the SEC before investing. The offering is being made only by means of its offering statement. This document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. An indication of interest involves no obligation or commitment of any kind. Any person interested in investing in any offering of Props Tokens should review our disclosures and the publicly filed offering statement and the final offering circular that is part of that offering statement at http://offeringcircular.propsproject.com.

Forward-looking statements: This communication contains forward-looking statements that are based on our beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements in this document include, but are not limited to, statements about our plans for developing the platform and future utility for the Props Token, our Reg A+ offering and launch of our network, and collaborations and partnerships. These statements involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different. More information on the factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause or contribute to such differences is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion & Analysis\u201d sections of our offering statement on Form 1-A. We cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. 1 Props will initially be available only on the YouNow app. Other apps are in the process of integrating Props at the moment, and we anticipate that they will launch it in the coming months. Users of an app that integrates Props may be able to receive Props upon their review and acceptance of the terms and conditions for use of the app and the completion of certain other administrative steps. A \"financial stake in the network\" means the ability to participate in an increase in the value of Props if the use of our platform increases and results in an increase in the demand for, and therefore the value of, Props. Holders of Props will not receive an interest in the profits or losses of any YouNow, Props PBC, or any other YouNow affiliate, any rights to distributions from YouNow, Props PBC, or any other YouNow affiliate, or any legal or contractual right to exercise control over the operations or continued development of YouNow, Props PBC, or any legal or contractual right to exercise control over the operations or continued development of any YouNow affiliate. 2 There are currently no national securities exchanges or exchanges that have been approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or registered under Form ATS with the Securities and Exchange Commission to support the trading of Props on the secondary market. As a result, holders should be prepared to hold Props indefinitely, as there is no guarantee that holders will be able to sell or exchange their Props or realize any financial profit from their Props. 3 Some modifications to an app may be needed in order to ensure Props are fully functional. 4 Transactions of Props Tokens require the payment of transaction fees in order to be effected on the Ethereum blockchain. YouNow may not pay these transaction fees and you may be responsible for these payments. 5 Props will initially be available only on the YouNow app. Other apps are in the process of integrating Props at the moment, and we anticipate that they will launch it in the coming months. 6 Users can buy virtual items for other users on YouNow, and some users can benefit from a revenue sharing system when they receive virtual items. 7 Applies to Props holders above a certain level, please see terms and conditions or Offering Circular for more details. 8 Some, but not all, of these features will be available upon qualification. Features that are not available upon qualification are coming soon.
