Job summary: You are changing the status quo with public blockchains. Existing blockchains are inherently slow or centralized. Storecoin wants to change that with its BlockFin consensus protocol. With its innovative approach, BlockFin brings scalability and decentralization to public blockchains. You are responsible for architecting, implementing, deploying, and securing Storecoin blockchain powered by BlockFin. Description: Public blockchains are either highly scalable or decentralized, but rarely both.

As a senior protocol engineer, you are responsible for: Designing the BlockFin consensus protocol primitives so they can be deployed securely in untrusted environments Implementing the protocol Creating necessary testing infrastructure to verify the protocol behavior in a large peer-to-peer network Instrumenting catastrophic failure handlers, so any security breaches can be identified and serious damages prevented automatically Automatic deployment of software patches and enhancements over a large number of geographically distributed network nodes Securing the network. Qualifications: Strong desire to change the status quo. Experience in distributed secure computing, especially in a peer-to-peer setup. Some experience in cryptography in the area of public key management and signature schemes. Experience in secure coding practices and ability to audit the code in a large scale project. Experience in Javascript in Node.js environment and scaling with Node.js. Similar experience in Python/Go is fine too.
