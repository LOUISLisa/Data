    "Body": "Sign in Top Story Medium tips Submit How I beat 140+ job seekers and landed a top-tier blockchain startup job without a degree \u2014 in 19 minutes A long title needs a long intro! This story is meant to be read from start to finish. I hope to provoke you to push yourself towards achieving what you WANT to do, not just what you think you CAN do. For the record, I\u2019ve been asked this question 5 times in a week now, hence this thorough explanation. Andreas Hauser Follow Sep 26, 2018 \u00c2\u00b7 19 min read If you\u2019re feeling lazy, this entire story can be summed up in one formula: 1)Acquire knowledge + 2)provide value * 3)get noticed = 4)end goal. 1 is needed for 2, which is necessary for 3. The quantity of 3 determines how quickly you get to 4. But there is one caveat to that. If you plan on pursuing your dreams half-heartedly, then this article is not for you. If you want to give it everything you\u2019ve got and work hard, however, then here\u2019s my story\u2026 Today is exactly one year since I first heard about blockchain. For some time now I\u2019ve had the dream of being able to retire at age 30, and learning about blockchain made that dream turn into a plan. So I made a rough sketch of that plan and followed it \u2014 with ups and downs, of course. I\u2019m 22, so still plenty of time to go! I should probably mention that before hearing about blockchain I had absolutely no technology experience or knowledge. I had also quit school at age 16, and I had severe depressions about half the year, every year. So, in order to reach this somewhat optimistic goal of becoming financially independent at age 30, I realized I had to (and still must) do the opposite of the norm. Why? Because society tends to push us towards things that keep us locked in a specific role: Work your way up in a job hierarchy, get a mortgage, make a family, teach your children to do the same, and the cycle repeats. This was never that attractive to me. I\u2019m also a pacifist hippie, so being a criminal supermind doesn\u2019t really fit my personality\u2026 although it would be pretty interesting to try out \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0086 For me, life quality goes up as the time you spend working decreases while the financial outcome increases. In other words, the ratio between work and money should look like this: This \u00e2\u0098\u009d \u00ef\u00b8\u008fmight not make sense. I don\u2019t know\u2026 Maybe I should have finished math class lol. So I set 6 dilemmas to track for the entrepreneurial activities I needed to do: Physical vs digital You can only sell an object once, but you can sell a digital item forever. That rules out any sort of physical work, but just selling stuff online is not that interesting (unless you made it yourself). The same goes for manual work, i.e. \u201cwhat you put in is what you get out\u201d \u2014 such as doing translations online. One page = x dollars, which doesn\u2019t scale well (I did this for 3 years). Invest vs work While I did try the investing route at first, I simply didn\u2019t have the starting capital to achieve anything meaningful. Sure, I managed to convert $2k into nearly $50k last year by investing in ICOs, but then 2018 came along, and the rest is history. So how about working for a crypto company instead? That might be a more reliable way to get good financial results. Established vs startup Founding or joining a startup usually scales better for you long-term, especially if you can get shares. People in established companies are often stuck for years with salaries just high enough as a carrot to keep them there for decades, hoping they\u2019ll eventually get that crucial promotion. What usually happens, though (and no employer will openly admit this), is that the individual becomes so good at that one role that the employer will do anything to keep him locked there. Shares vs tokens vs a high salary \u201cSix months [in the crypto world] is comparative to five years in a traditional venture market.\u201d \u2014 Kavita Gupta, fund manager at Consensys. I think this speaks for itself. Regarding the salary, I also opted for a job with a lower monthly payout in fiat, but with a much higher reward in tokens for staying at least a year and a half. Not an existing token, but the company\u2019s own soon-to-be-launched token. Maybe I should write a similar article about how to spot a good vs a bad token (i.e. a \u201cshitcoin\u201d) \u2014 let me know in the comments. So right now, if the token value doesn\u2019t move in either direction, I\u2019ll be getting my monthly salary + almost 7x that number in tokens every month for 3 years after the first 18 months. 5. App vs protocol The company\u2019s product can act as an application (like a hotel chain, web bureau, or Litecoin), or a protocol (like Airbnb, Wordpress, or Ethereum). The protocol-like business will scale considerably faster if done right. Watch THIS if you\u2019re new to that kind of thinking. 6. In-house vs remote I have to enjoy this job for at least a few years, so being able to work from home or on the fly is extremely important to me. If there\u2019s one thing that kills my creativity, it\u2019s routine. And creativity is what I use every day to get what I want in life. I recommend listening to \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u0098this song\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u0098 while reading on. If you can do that while reading this then you can literally do anything\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00aa Regarding point 1, while it was technically possible to scale my previous freelance translation business indefinitely, I also have to find my work interesting, and I was getting kinda tired of it\u2026 Here are two very different examples of how you can scale an otherwise manual job such as translating online: a) When you\u2019re good enough you will get more clients than you can serve. Simply set up a referral deal with a few competent colleagues and earn a percentage of the money they get from your leads. Keep doing this and eventually, you won\u2019t have to work at all. You become the employer, kinda. b) One colleague fed his 10+ years of legal translation documents to an AI he built, which allowed it to spit out 99.99% correct legal translations automatically. In other words, what previously took him 8 hours to do manually, he can now do in 5\u201310 minutes automatically. He\u2019s probably lying on a beach somewhere by now \u00e2\u009b\u00b1\u00ef\u00b8\u008f But you\u2019re here to read about joining a top-tier startup, and not automating your manual business. So, today I\u2019m challenging you to take these 4 and a half steps: Step 1: Read this article. Step 2: Watch this movie as soon as possible! (It\u2019ll teach you to succeed by sheer attitude, will, and creativity\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00aa). Step 3: Learn something new which concerns your dream job, every day. Step 4: Teach what you\u2019ve learned & got your name out there! Step 4.5: Produce high-quality content after repeating step 3 a bunch. Repeat step 1 & 2 when feeling demotivated. About Step 4.5: I started out by writing guides on how to invest in ICOs and shortly thereafter which ICOs to invest in (yikes), as well as summing up what I had learned in a clickbaity article. The latter actually got me an advisory role at a FinTech company, which proves my point. At the time of writing that article I\u2019d been in crypto for just 4 months, and approximately 4 months after writing it the CEO of the company reached out. These things are not as rare as you might think. Today that kind of content is no longer super attractive, though. But topics like \u201chow to join a blockchain startup\u201d, \u201chow to spot a shitcoin\u201d or \u201chow to not get \u00f0\u009f\u0096\u0095FUCKED\u00f0\u009f\u0096\u0095 in a bear market\u201d might be. So I\u2019m writing this piece simply as an open observation of a series of seemingly random and sporadic events that have all lead to a very specific outcome. It is my hope that I can inspire YOU to perhaps start risking more and re-thinking your approach to achieving your professional goals. If I can do it, so can you! Pinky promise. \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u0099 Let\u2019s go! \u201cFailure is simply an opportunity to start again \u2014 this time more intelligently\u201d \u2014 Somebody on the Internet The moment I saw \u00e2\u0098\u009d\u00ef\u00b8\u008f quote was the moment I decided to write this story. But let me just start out by explaining why it applies to my situation\u2026 From age 16 to 21, I have: Started a blog about\u2026 thoughts! - This was my way of dealing with boring classes in school. Quit high school to travel Europe for a few months, without a plan. - Started on Cyprus and hitchhiked to Greece somehow. This was when I was first introduced to the beauty of decentralization through the Native American-inspired Rainbow Family. \u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00b3\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u200d\u00f0\u009f\u008c\u0088 Started (and quit) 5 different pre-university educations lasting between 1 & 60 days. - Short attention span when it comes to institutional thinking. What can I say? I think schools need to up their game if they want to stay relevant. Worked as a dishwasher for 30 days. - Sorry to all the restaurant guests for the drum n\u2019 bass coming from the kitchen\u2026\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00bf Worked full-time for Amnesty International for like 5 days. - It really sucked. Like, really really. Kudos to that one guy who signed 10 people per day \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u0080 \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008f Worked for an animal rights org for 3 months, handing out flyers. - Muuuch nicer than begging for money on behalf of strangers. Started a non-profit called \u201cFree Food Movement\u201d to provide the world with free food through a decentralized farming collective. - How do you think that went? Started a freelance translation company which was my main source of income from age 18\u201321. - Crawled my way up from $5/hour to $50/hour. Worked 100 hours some weeks and 10 hours in others. This allowed me to be super flexible with my time and work while traveling. During this time I translated all sorts of stuff for 30+ different companies. This work slowly introduced me to the tech world which was a nice primer for what was to come. Got some work at an organic veggie farm. Lovely! - Lived there for 18 months, though I spent most of my time translating rather than farming. Started an art blog for some friends. Started another blog. And another one. Etc\u2026 Started a vegan chocolate review blog. \u00f0\u009f\u008d\u00aa\u00f0\u009f\u008d\u00aa\u00f0\u009f\u008d\u00aa Moved to Brno, CZ, to work as an in-house translator. - A British company hired me to translate Danish texts in the Czech Republic\u2026 go figure. It lasted 5 weeks. Too corporate. \u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00bc \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00ac Started a meetup platform for vegans and vegetarians. - 20 users. Yay. Probably started 15\u201320 websites by age 21. - I\u2019m not a coder, but sites like Wordpress and Squarespace allow you to just point and click. \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u0093 In between all of these things, I also worked as a volunteer in Spain, Sweden, Germany, Cyprus, and lived like a vagabond in Turkey for about a month (sorry mom). DISCOVERED BITCOIN in September 2017! So this is the interesting part. From now on I will go into more detail on all the things that happened during the next ~10 months, why they were not random even though it may seem that way, and how you can benefit from copying my approach. It was necessary to list all the previous events in my work life to give you some background understanding of what you\u2019re really here for: How to land a job with no formal education. From my experience education is fine, but the experience is better\u2026 sometimes? In case you don\u2019t remember the first quote about failure, here\u2019s another one: I haven\u2019t failed. I\u2019ve just found 10,000 ways that won\u2019t work. \u2014 Thomas Edison So, now was the point in time where I adopted the tracking of those 6 dilemmas mentioned before, so keep that in mind while reading the following: September 2017 | Quit doing translations and almost literally locked myself in a room for a week to read all I could about Bitcoin, altcoins, blockchain, and smartcontracts (and continued reading 4\u20138 hours every single day for the next 3 months). - Big emphasis on the all I could! It doesn\u2019t matter whether you have 40 years\u2019 IT experience or work in a daycare center: The first time you heard about Bitcoin, EVERY explanation of a term lead to further questions in a seemingly endless continuum, right? \u201cWhat powers Bitcoin? \u2014 blockchain.\u201d \u201cWhat powers blockchain? \u2014 everyone and no one in particular.\u201d \u201cAnd who invented Bitcoin or, errh, blockchain or whatever? \u2014 well\u2026\u201d \u201cSo how does the blockchain work? \u2014 not the, but a.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s more? Like what? \u2014 Ethereum, Neo, Eos, etc.\u201d \u201cEt cetera? \u2014 no, Ethereum Classic.\u201d \u201cTwo Ethereums?? \u2014 no, there\u2019s like six. People forked the shit out of it.\u201d \u201cOk, so how many other coins are there? \u2014 do you mean coins or tokens? \u201cThere\u2019s a difference? \u2014 yes, usually an asset launched on a platform is called a token while a coin is the underlying asset, like Ether.\u201d \u201cWha..? What do these tokens do? \u2014 well, it depends. You decide.\u201d \u201cWait, I can make my own cryptocurrency? \u2014 yeah, takes like 10 minutes.\u201d \u201cBut where does the value come from? \u2014 well, you see.. that\u2019s\u2026 yeah.\u201d \u201cOk but there are other cryptos out there, with value? Can you mention some?

Just say a number\u2026 \u2014 about 5,006 and counting\u201d \u201c\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00b5 can we talk about something else, please? \u2014 Sure, pick a topic: exchanges, stablecoins, day trading, TA, HODL, ICOs, market mentality, bounties, airdrops, FOMO, FUD, nodes, oracles, PoW, PoS, PoI, DPoS, PoA, BFT, PoWeight, DAG, the Tangle, Hashgraph, addresses, private keys, wallets (exchange, mobile, web, software, hardware, paper), dapps, gas, mooning, 51% attacks, block rewards, block heights, confirmations, DAOs, hash rates, fees, permission, permissionless\u2026 Or would you rather talk about the regulatory aspects behind all of this? Or the economic implications? Or how blockchain will completely reshape the world as we know it? \u201c\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00aa \u201d \u2014 Just buy Bitcoin and you should be safe. Don\u2019t worry \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u009e Alright, so maybe I got carried away a bit. My point is that if you want to stay ahead of the game, you must know more than your peers about not just blockchain, but the surrounding areas as well. If you know more about a certain topic than those around you like blockchain and crypto, you will become the person they ask and refer other to people too This, in turn, can be turned into an income stream as well. September 2017 | Made a simple website to teach crypto basics. - This was only a few weeks after learning about Bitcoin and served as a good test: Could I explain what I had learned to complete strangers? By teaching crypto and blockchain fundamentals as well as making \u201chow to\u201d guides for Coinbase and MyEtherWallet, I managed to earn a staggering $60 via my referral link. Woohoo! I abandoned the project as soon as I learned about ICOs, though. September/October 2017 | Started reviewing ICOs on Steemit. Founded an ICO group with 1,500 members. - This topic was extremely hyped in mid to late 2017. I still believe that ICOs are a fantastic tool for low net-worth individuals to increase their (our) capital, but you gotta dig deep to find the good ones! On the flipside, I believe they can also be a fantastic tool for projects (WITH A GENUINE TOKEN UTILITY!!) to raise money from the general public. I also saw a niche in the content creation market since most people wrote short, low-quality articles, so I did the opposite and spent at least a day reading the whitepaper 1\u20132 times and find all the info I could before even deciding whether or not I would write a review. This is also when I started a Facebook group for sharing and discovering good ICOs, which grew from 0\u20131,500 members in less than a month. A few reviews later I was contacted by the CEO of a company I had featured. He liked my article so much that he spent the next weekend setting up a professional ICO review site for me\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008d. Someone also made this neat video for the site: If you\u2019re that guy, please reach out again! I lost your email\u00e2\u0098\u00b9\u00ef\u00b8\u008f But the greed took over around the time I discovered bounties \u2014 a way to get tokens for doing online marketing, basically, and soon I would only review ICOs with a really good bounty programme. This left a bad taste in my mouth so I stopped after only a few weeks after launching the website. \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008c In late October I also closed the group. The spammers got the better of me, and I hated spending hours every day moderating people who acted like bots (or were they just actual bots?\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u0096) However, these ICO review articles led me to get noticed by a Google-backed startup in the e-commerce sector. In short, they offered to hire me on 2\u20133 occasions during the next 2\u20133 months, but my passion wasn\u2019t for e-commerce so I ended up turning them down. From all of my past experiences ,I\u2019ve learned that I simply cannot perform if I don\u2019t absolutely love what I do. November/December 2017 | Nothing, but not really nothing. - So at this point, I had spent approximately 2 months soaking up everything I could about blockchain and ICOs. I was getting a bit fatigued at this point, but I kept getting my name out there in local and international Facebook groups and ICO Telegram channels. I\u2019m sure there were blockchain veterans cringing super hard whenever I would answer new members\u2019 questions that I had just learned the answers to myself. But this, to me, is how you learn the fastest \u2014 if you can\u2019t explain a concept then you probably don\u2019t understand it properly, which brings me back to point 3 & 4 in my 4.5-step challenge to you up top. \u00e2\u0098\u009d\u00ef\u00b8\u008f Every day I would give helpful and clear answers to people asking how to do this or that, because when you\u2019re seeking answers to basic questions like \u201chow do I set up a MEW,\u201d any halfwit giving you the exact information you need will look like an expert to you, at that moment. And others will start noticing. December/January 2018 | Made a local online crypto school. - Depending on when you read this, that\u00f0\u009f\u0091\u0086 domain might have expired. Anyway, \u201cKryptoskolen\u201d literally translates to \u201ccrypto school\u201d and was a nice way to market and spread what I had learned thus far, for free. The front page was a simple primer of what exactly Bitcoin is, and then I had written guides on: - How to get started - How to use Coinbase - How to use KuCoin - How to set up MyEtherWallet - The 6 cryptocurrency wallet types - What is blockchain? - Crypto glossary/vocabulary There were also guest-written blog posts and an advertisement for a local crypto coach + a bio page where I showed off my amazing ICO investing skills. Kryptoskolen had its own Facebook group with ~200 members after a few weeks. However, I was overcome with winter depression, so I stopped this project after about a month and actually put crypto aside for just as long. In January I did a talk on how I invest in ICOs (because at that time I had 30 x\u2019ed my portfolio), and I also gave 2 private coaching sessions for $90/hour. I could have just continued doing this, but as mentioned I was too depressed to think about money at the time. February/March 2018 | Joined Backed. - While not being super excited about crypto early on in the year, I was still decently active in local forums. Kevin, the founder of Backed, noticed this and offered me an advisory role in his startup. This quickly turned into something more and before I knew it my title was \u201cManaging Partner,\u201d and my responsibilities included everything Kevin was too busy to do + a high hourly rate in equity for doing so. Kevin taught me a lot about the traditional finance world, startup life, and living amongst celebrities \u00e2\u009c\u008c\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0086 as I stayed over from time to time and worked out of is apartment. This guy makes an 80-hour work week seem normal. This life and line of business did not appeal to me, however, so I resigned just a few months after working there. April/May 2018 | Worked on my own crypto concept for a while. - So, here\u2019s the deal. Plastics are fucking up our nature.. There are two approaches to fix this: a) make and implement biodegradable alternatives and b) clean up the existing waste. Both are needed. My idea was an answer to the question \u201cHow do we clean up Earth asap?\u201d What if anyone could earn money by collecting plastic and disposing of it? This Vision Deck was an attempt to construct a decentralized, community-controlled concept to facilitate this. In essence, we would have a token (EARTH), a blockchain (EarthChain, probably a Steem fork), a platform (clean2earn), and an organisation (DecentrAlliance). In time this org could then facilitate other activities as well: However, around this time I had already spent all of my savings and on top of that I didn\u2019t quite have the mental capacity to spearhead such an undertaking, so I stopped working on it for now. If you want to develop on this concept, feel free to reach out or steal it. Just notify me if you succeed\u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008d July 2018 | Applied for a few positions on crypto.jobs. - Before I go on, I just want to give a brief introduction to the mentioned site. I found my current job there, and I think many people in the industry owe a huge thanks to the guys at crypto.jobs for providing such an awesome, easy to use, and FREE platform for both job seeker and employer. Since starting at AnyLedger I\u2019ve used crypto.jobs to reach a big number of marketers and developers completely for free. So, now it was time to use all those past experiences and projects for something bigger than myself. But I didn\u2019t just want to pick the first thing that came along. I had to stick to the initial plan of increasing my knowledge and finances exponentially, not just linearly. While after just a few days of searching there were offers on the table with 100\u2013200% more $ per month, none of them had the same potential for exponential growth as AnyLedger. This whole article is basically an explanation of why that is my opinion, but let me briefly reiterate \u2026 - AnyLedger is a blockchain company with a digital, infinitely re-sellableproduct \u2014 SaaS/BaaS (Software/Blockchain-as-a-Service). - It\u2019s a startup which equals higher growth potential. - The product is a protocol, not just an application \u2014 the product allows any company to build their own IoT-blockchain applications without having to worry about the underlying complexity. - I can get tokens on top of my salary. - I can work remotely if I want to. If you scroll to the top and read the 6 dilemmas again, you\u2019ll find that this fulfills all of those main points. Tips for your job application If you\u2019re still reading then here\u2019s a small bonus to help you get in front of the competition. Know your worth. This can be hard if you have no point of reference, but try to put some effort into calculating how much your time is worth; is it worth 100 bucks per week or 1,000? Keep in mind that you will have to live up to that number every week \u2014 your salary expectations/request MUST align with the value you can provide. Provide value immediately. Showcasing your skills immediately shows the employer that you are a)more than just interested, b) knowledgeable about X topic, and c) can take initiative (and therefore responsibility). It doesn\u2019t have to be anything complicated. To give a real-life example, here\u2019s what I wrote to Lorenzo after our first conversation: This is what I sent Lorenzo: \u201cWith regards to website design, I think Substratum and Divi are also very great to look at https://substratum.net/ https://diviproject.org/ I especially like Divi\u2019s simplicity and roadmap design. I think a great way to improve anyledger.io would be to make the paragraphs much shorter and \u201cinspiring.\u201d So about the Smart Sensors for example, instead of the current text, you could write something like \u201cAnyLedger introduces a new level of security to billions of smart sensors around the world while allowing them to automatically monetize the transmitted data.\u201d \u2014 with a link to an in-depth article about exactly how this works and why it is needed. So instead of describing the details of \u201chow it works\u201d and \u201cwhat it can do\u201d, simply explain \u201cwhat it means/enables\u201d in one sentence with some vibrant colors on the picture, and then the curious reader can click through to the article and read 1000\u20132000 words about the process accompanied by a graphic display of the architecture. Hope it makes sense. And I really like \u201cWe give your IoT device decentralized superpowers!\u201d It\u2019s a nice slogan. But I think it needs some explanation in article form as well, for the average ICO investor. Alternatively, you could change the figures below the slogan (\u201cEmbedded Wallet\u201d, Blockchain gateway\u201d, etc.) So instead of having this text for the embedded wallet: \u201cA lightweight hardware wallet running on your IoT device. Built on top of ARM TrustZone, featuring over-the-air updates and blockchain integrity checks,\u201d you could write something like: \u201cGiving your IoT device the power to send and receive cryptocurrency automatically\u201d and then have an arrow/button that shows a longer, more technical explanation below it when clicked. Why? Because even though you are a b2b project, you will still need to have a b2c approach when it comes to your ICO. Words like \u201clightweight wallet\u201d, \u201cAMR TrustZone\u201d and \u201cover-the-air\u201d will only really make sense for 10\u201320% of your potential contributors, whereas a simple explanation with easy words will make sure that 100% of your visitors understand exactly what your technology enables. I believe great design is achieved when the user can choose their level of engagement \u2014 the tech-savvy investors will always read the explanation and the average investors will be content with just reading \u201cwhat it means\u201d in a simple sentence :) I should note that pretty much none of these changes have been implemented since I was hired \u2014 a much more extensive website refactoring will take place pretty soon. 3. Respect yourself Remember, they are not just interviewing you. You are also interviewing them \u2014 \u201ccould I imagine working at this company, with these people?\u201d Don\u2019t be a job whore!
