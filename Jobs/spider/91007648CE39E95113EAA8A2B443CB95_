According to a report from CNBC, while more jobs in blockchain are arising, the youth of the industry means that there aren\u2019t many people with the full skillsets required. Julian Hosp, co-founder of Singapore-based crypto wallet and card start-up TenX, said: \u201cWe hardly ever hire from inside of crypto because most people inside of crypto are very inexperienced. You have very, very few people who are experienced who get into the crypto industry.\u201d As expected, interest in Bitcoin-related roles began to rise sharply at the tail end of 2017, at the same time as the virtual coin\u2019s value spiked. \u201cIf crypto is doing well, if people are making money in crypto, we get huge inbound from people because they feel like, \u2018I need to jump on this wave\u2019,\u201d Hosp continued. \u201cAnd then when you see crypto going down \u2013 and we saw this at the very beginning [of this year] and we\u2019re seeing this right now \u2013 then we see that immediately the demand of people, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh no, this is a dying industry, I shouldn\u2019t go in there.\u2019 So it\u2019s completely emotional.\u201d Data from Indeed, measuring jobs against searches per 1 million, shows that since September 2017 job openings on the service have risen consistantly. Searches have also increased, though at a slower pace. A spokesperson for Indeed said: \u201cThe situation in Asia seems to mirror the US in that Bitcoin [job search] trends are much more volatile (and related to price volatility) and resulting media coverage while blockchain and cryptocurrency searches have seen a more consistent upwards trajectory.\u201d Related Posts CFA Institute adds crypto and blockchain to its exams The CFA Institute, behind one of the hardest finance exams, will add crypto and blockchain-related\u2026 India enjoys big jobs boom in cryptocurrency and blockchain As the Indian government considers tighter regulation, the local jobs market in cryptocurrency and blockchain\u2026 U.S. Congressman to lead pro-blockchain and crypto legislation A Congressman in America is trying to get proper government support for blockchain technologies and\u2026 ????????????
