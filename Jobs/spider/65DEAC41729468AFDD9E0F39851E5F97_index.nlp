What it shows is the amount of interest that people have shown towards the keyword \u201cBlockchain Jobs\u201d over the past 5 years. As can be seen, the need and the general interest in this subject has been increasing, and rightfully so. Since this happens to be such a hot topic, this guide will address some of these issues. If you are looking for a blockchain job, or if you have a blockchain company and are looking to hire someone, this guide is for you! 2017: The Rise and Rise of Blockchain Jobs 2018: Demand Going Up or Down? Why Should You Opt for Blockchain Jobs? #1 Better Pay #2 Remote Flexibility #3 Employee Liquidity Career Options In the Blockchain Space Blockchain Developers What are Smart Contracts? Non-Technical Positions Companies Offering Blockchain Jobs Crypto Companies Offering Blockchain Jobs Blockchain jobs: Conclusion 2017: The Rise and Rise of Blockchain Jobs 2017 was the seminal year for blockchain technology. You could even say that that was the year when blockchain technology truly arrived. The numbers don\u2019t lie and some of the numbers are truly staggering. Indeed.com, one of the biggest job portals in the world, published some interesting statistics regarding the rise of Blockchain jobs. It looks like the number of blockchain jobs increased from December 2016 to December 2017 by a staggering 207%. But that\u2019s not the end of it. According to the stats, this number has increased by, a scarcely believable 631% since November 2015. Cryptocurrency was such a hot topic in 2017, that 15 of the 18 more popular industry jobs specifically mentioned \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d in the description. Showing how hot cryptocurrency has become in 2017 after being generally overshadowed by blockchain in 2016, 15 out of the 18 most popular industry jobs specifically mentioned \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d in the description. Because of this rapid surge of interest, the biggest industries are desperately looking for high-quality talent in a field which, as of now, is extremely limited. In fact, this was pointed out by Vice president of product at Indeed.com, Terence Chiu, when he told CoinDesk: ???????????? \u201cWhile the number of opportunities and searches are still quite small, Indeed data shows that companies are increasingly seeking experts to focus on this new technology \u2013 and job seekers have been quick to react.\u201d ???????????? Image Credit: Coindesk. ???????????? Upwork, which is one of the biggest freelance hubs in the world, curated the list of the top 20 most desired skills in the Q3 of 2017. Turns out that blockchain engineering was the second most desired skill in the market (robotics specialist being first.) 2018: Demand Going Up or Down? 2018 saw the overall market cap for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies go down. It seems that the demand for cryptocurrency jobs is directly related to the market cap as well since those seemed to have gone down as well, according to this article by Quartz. However, the demand for blockchain jobs is as high as it has ever been. In fact, this can be clearly seen in the graph given by Indeed: Why Should You Opt for Blockchain Jobs? We have already established thus far that demand for blockchain jobs is at an all-time high. But that may not be enough to convince you to plot a new career path here. For this, let\u2019s explore some more reasons as to why you should opt for a blockchain job. (The content idea and graphs for this section has been taken from this Angel blog.) #1 Better Pay Since this is such a young field and the talent available is pretty limited, the salaries offered throughout both technical and non-technical fields are 10-20% higher than the salaries offered in a normal job. Plus, it is also worth noting that the profit sharing models in crypto jobs are way better and the incentives a lot higher. #2 Remote Flexibility Remote jobs are on the rise and more and more people are quickly shunning the concept of an \u201coffice\u201d and opting for location flexibility. This is another area where crypto companies outdo their legacy peers. Plus, remember that crypto companies are far more likely to give you the \u201cwork from home\u201d option and require you to come to work only on specific days. #3 Employee Liquidity This is a perk which is limited to token companies. Usually, at a startup, employees receive equity and have to wait for a liquidity event to sell shares and get Fiat currency. This may itself be a very complex process and in many scenarios, grants given by companies are very restrictive which blocks secondary transactions. In blockchain companies, employees usually get tokens which acts as an equity-like compensation. These tokens, unlike shares, are inherently liquid, even though some of them may still have restrictions on them. So, now that you know why you should look for a career in the blockchain space, let\u2019s see exactly what you can do. Career Options In the Blockchain Space The following chart shows the breakdown of the jobs in this space. Now keep in mind that the chart shows the requirement specified in Angel list, but we feel that it gives a fair breakdown of the requirement in general. Note: Developers are included in Engineering. Blockchain Developers Blockchain Developers are easily the most in-demand niche in the space. They are the ones who get paid the highest and depending on where they are working, they may get staggering levels of salary. E.g.in Silicon Valley, US, a blockchain developer can get an annual wage of $158k. When you compare that with the fact that a senior hardware developer in NVidia gets an annual salary of $135k, it is pretty impressive. However, that\u2019s not the end of it. In Switzerland, blockchain developers get paid 120k-180k USD annually but in a stark contrast, developers in Great Britain get paid 50-90k annually. But that\u2019s for salaried folks. What about freelance developers? According to this article by Kirill Shilov, freelance consultants can get paid from $50 \u2013 $100 per hour. So, what do you have to do to become a blockchain developer? First, of, you need to know what smart contracts are, and since Ethereum is the hottest smart contract platform out there, you must learn how to code in solidity. What are Smart Contracts? Smart contracts are automated contracts. They are self-executing with specific instructions written on its code which get executed when certain conditions are made. You can learn more about smart contracts in our in-depth guide here. Smart contracts are how things get done in the Ethereum ecosystem. When someone wants to get a particular task done in Ethereum they initiate a smart contract with one or more people. Smart contracts are a series of instructions, written using the programming language \u201csolidity\u201d, which works on the basis of the IFTTT logic aka the IF-THIS-THEN-THAT logic. Basically, if the first set of instructions are done then execute the next function and after that the next and keep on repeating until you reach the end of the contract. The best way to understand that is by imagining a vending machine. Each and every step that you take acts like a trigger for the next step to execute itself. It is kinda like the domino effect. So, let\u2019s examine the steps that you will take while interacting with the vending machine: Step 1: You give the vending machine some money. ???????????? Step 2: You punch in the button corresponding to the item that you want. ???????????? Step 3: The item comes out and you collect it. ???????????? Now look at all those steps and think about it. Will any of the steps work if the previous one wasn\u2019t executed? Each and every one of those steps is directly related to the previous step. There is one more factor to think about, and it is an integral part of smart contracts. You see, in your entire interaction with the vending machine, you (the requestor) were solely working with the machine (the provider). There were absolutely no third parties involved. So, now how would this transaction have looked like if it happened in the Ethereum network? Suppose you just bought something from a vending machine in the Ethereum network, how will the steps look like then? Step 1: You give the vending machine some money and this gets recorded by all the nodes in the Ethereum network and the transaction gets updated in the ledger. ???????????? Step 2: You punch in the button corresponding to the item that you want and record of that gets updated in the Ethereum network and ledger. ???????????? Step 3: The item comes out and you collect it and this gets recorded by all the nodes and the ledger. ???????????? Every transaction that you go through the smart contracts will get recorded and updated by the network. What this does is that it keeps everyone involved with the contract accountable for their actions. It takes away human malice by making every action taken visible to the entire network ???????????? What is Solidity? For anyone who wants to learn how to create smart contracts, Solidity is an absolute must. We already have a detailed guide on it which you can read here. However, here we are going to give you a basic overview. Solidity was developed by Gavin Wood, Christian Reitwiessner, Alex Beregszaszi, Yoichi Hirai and several former Ethereum core contributors to enable writing smart contracts on blockchain platforms such as Ethereum. Solidity is a purposefully slimmed down, loosely-typed language with a syntax very similar to ECMAScript (Javascript). There are some key points to remember from the Ethereum Design Rationale document, namely that we are working on a stack-and-memory model with a 32-byte instruction word size, the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) gives us access to the program \u201cstack\u201d which is like a register space where we can also stick memory addresses to make the Program Counter loop/jump (for sequential program control), an expandable temporary \u201cmemory\u201d and a more permanent \u201cstorage\u201d which is actually written into the permanent blockchain, and most importantly, the EVM requires total determinism within the smart contracts. NOTE: Ethereum is planning to eventually move on from Solidity to Viper. ???????????? So, before we continue, let\u2019s check out a basic Solidity contract example. (Codes taken from github). ???????????? Let\u2019s run a simple while loop in solidity: ???????????? print 'hello world!'contract BasicIterator\n\n\n\n{\n\n\n\naddress creator; // reserve one \"address\"-type spot\n\n\n\nuint8[10] integers; // reserve a chunk of storage for 10 8-bit unsigned integers in an array\n\n\n\nfunction BasicIterator()\n\n\n\n{\n\n\n\ncreator = msg.sender;\n\n\n\nuint8 x = 0;\n\n\n\n//Section 1: Assigning values\n\n\n\nwhile(x < integers.length) {\n\n\n\nintegers[x] = x; ????????????\n\n\n\nx++;\n\n\n\n} }\n\n\n\nfunction getSum() constant returns (uint) {\n\n\n\nuint8 sum = 0;\n\n\n\nuint8 x = 0;\n\n\n\n\n//Section 2: Adding the integers in an array.\n\n\n\nwhile(x < integers.length) {\n\nsum = sum + integers[x];\n\n\n\nx++;\n\n}\n\n\n\nreturn sum;\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n// Section 3: Killing the contract\n\n\n\nfunction kill()\n\n\n\n{\n\n\n\nif (msg.sender == creator)\n\n\n\n{\n\n\n\nsuicide(creator);\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n}\n ???????????? So, let\u2019s analyse the code. For ease of understanding we have have divided the code into 3 sections. ???????????? Section 1: Assigning Values In the first step we are filling up an array called \u201cintegers\u201d which takes in 10 8-bit unsigned integers. ????????????The way we are doing it is via a while loop. Let\u2019s look at what is happening inside the while loop. while(x < integers.length) {\n\n\n\nintegers[x] = x;\n\n\n\nx++;\n\n\n\n}\n ???????????? Remember, we have already assigned a value of \u201c0\u201d to the integer x. The while loop goes from 0 to integers.length. Integers.length is a function which returns the max capacity of the array. So, if we decided that an array will have 10 integers, arrayname.length will return a value of 10. In the loop above, the value of x goes from 0 \u2013 9 (<10) and assigns the value of itself to the integers array as well. So, at the end of the loop, integers will have the following value: ???????????? 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. ???????????? Section 2: Adding the array content Inside the getSum() function we are going to add up the contents of the array itself. The way is going to do it is by repeating the same while loop as above and using the variable \u201csum\u201d to add the contents of the array. ???????????? Section 3: Killing the contract This function kills the contract and sends the remaining funds in the contract back to the contract creator. When asked about what was the inspiration and motivation behind creating solidity, Dr. Gavin Woods said this: ???????????? \u201cIt [Solidity] was meant to be a sophisticated tool for developing contracts that could ultimately give both developers and users good information on what the code did. To help this along, I devised NatSpec, a contract-friendly documentation format, and made that a first-class citizen in Solidity. I also proposed a formal proofing language subset (not yet implemented) in order to maximise the kinds of correctness guarantees that could be made. I introduced events as a first class citizen into the Solidity language in order to provide a nice abstraction for LOGs similar in form to function calls. Inspiration for that came from the Qt meta-object system\u2019s \u201csignals\u201d. One later feature that Christian R. and I figured out together was function modifiers; that allows attributes placed as part of a function signature to make some modifications to the apparent function body. Being a very declarative means of expression, it\u2019s an idiom that falls nicely into the contract-oriented programming space.\u201d ????????????

The following is an example of a Blockchain Developer\u2019s CV: Image Credit: Hackernoon Non-Technical Positions Not all the positions in the blockchain space, however, need technical expertise. Let\u2019s look at some of the non-technical positions in the blockchain space: The three most in-demand non-technical jobs are: Operations. Design/Product. Business. Now, these jobs are not that unique to blockchain companies, plenty of startups have these similar positions. But, as Angel.co puts it, hiring managers in this space are looking for something more. Specifically: #1 Eagerness to learn The main thing with this space is that it is constantly evolving. If you want to get into this space, then you will need to be constantly evolving. As Mernit from Smartshare puts it, \u201cBeing comfortable with ambiguity is important, they need to be able to figure things out without instructions. We need candidates who take the risk to figure it out on their own.\u201d ???????????? #2 Knowledge of the Blockchain Technology Since they are getting into the blockchain space, they must have the basic knowledge of blockchain technology. People involved in business and marketing must have enough knowledge to troubleshoot problems and speak confidently about the technology. If you are involved in any form of customer support, then you need to know how the technology works. Elizabeth from Lightning Labs eloquently puts, \u201cWe expect people to have prior knowledge, but the good news is there are many resources out there for people to get started learning on their own. We don\u2019t care if you have a degree. We care about your ability to learn and execute.\u201d ???????????? Companies Offering Blockchain Jobs Now let\u2019s look at some of the big legacy companies that are offering blockchain jobs. Most of the data has been taken from Glassdoor. You can also browse blockchain jobs at Bountyone.io. ???????????? IBM According to Wikipedia, \u201cThe International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Armonk, New York, United States, with operations in over 170 countries. The company began in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and was renamed \u201cInternational Business Machines\u201d in 1924.\u201d Let\u2019s look at some of the blockchain posts available in IBM. ???????????? #1 Sr. Consultant Blockchain Developer IBM Global Business Services (GBS) is hiring strong Senior Consultant Developers who develop technical solutions to solve clients\u2019 problems in various industries on one or more of the Blockchain Technology platforms, such as Hyperledger, Ethereum, and Ripple.

Accenture Accenture is a global management consulting and professional services firm that provides strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations services. They also happen to have the most Blockchain job openings in the world according to Forbes. So, what is the need for the blockchain technology in Accenture? They are focused on creating private blockchains that only their clients, business partners and customers can utilize. The three areas that they are seeing the most demand are: ???????????? Financial Services. Supply Chain. Identity. ???????????? The main roles that they are hiring for are the software developer, technical architect, and business strategist. But that still doesn\u2019t explain why they need to utilize the blockchain. Turns out that it is about trust. As David Treat, managing director and co-head of Accenture\u2019s global blockchain practice puts it, historically, organizations have rarely trusted one company to become a central data repository, \u201ceither because of the proprietary value of their data or due to a lack of trust in others.\u201d With blockchains, multiple parties maintain a replica of recorded transactions that can\u2019t be changed.
