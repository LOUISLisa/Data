Ledn is a technology company with a mission to help people save in bitcoin. Its suite of services is currently comprised of 3 core products: dollar loans backed by bitcoin (for those that want liquidity but do not want to sell), bitcoin savings account (for those that want to earn an extra yield on their bitcoin), and B2X (a service that doubles the amount of bitcoin through the use of a bitcoin-backed loan). Ledn has built a technology and operational stack that allows for real-time proof of bitcoin reserves, on-chain, which provides unprecedented transparency for bitcoin financial services. What am I like? Bitcoin is a fast-moving space - being prone to remain calm in stressful situations is important. We are all owners at Ledn, both in how we act and in our economics (every role has an equity component). As such, the candidate has to be willing to jump in to collaborate with all people in Ledn as required. They will need to have exceptional communication writing skills (verbally and written). What will I do? The successful candidate will be responsible for overseeing content creation for Ledn\u2019s social media networks, and will be responsible for liaising with Ledn\u2019s customers. Under the guidance of Ledn\u2019s CSO, this role will also interact with Ledn\u2019s product development pipeline as well as maintaining performance metrics and documenting marketing spend and client interactions. What is my experience? Exceptional communication skills and social media management skills. Please provide links to any published writing and social media profiles. Spanish, Portuguese or Mandarin speaking and writing skills would be ideal but not required. Please list any additional languages you can speak. Previous experience in the bitcoin industry or in Customer Support is a bonus but not a requirement. What do I need to know? A desire to learn about Bitcoin (prior knowledge would be a plus but don't worry, you don't have to be an OG). At Ledn you will learn first-hand about Bitcoin and what it enables. Experience with Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook and new platforms like TikTok and Twitch is a bonus but not required. We look forward to hearing from you, but please note; due to the high volume of applications, only candidates who qualify will be contacted.
