According to these nine Advisors in????????????The Oracles, who made millions by investing in real estate, it\u2019s still the best way to build wealth. Read more at CNBC.com > Permissionless, compliant, and first-of-its-kind RealToken provides investors with a simple, intelligent, and user-friendly method to buy into fractional, tokenized properties, leveraging the U.S. legal system and the permissionless, unrestricted token issuance of Ethereum. Investing with RealT means low maintenance property ownership, access to cash flows related to the property (e.g., rent), and frictionless ownership transactions via RealTokens. Grow a global, digital real estate portfolio Unique Tokens Ownership of each property is distributed across a finite number of representative tokens. Based on token share, owners can collect revenue from rent, and vote on property decisions. Property Managed Each RealT property has a property management company managing the property on RealToken owners behalf. The property management company sources tenants, collects rent, and manages repairs, so the diverse group of RealToken owners don\u2019t have to. LLC Owned Real estate can\u2019t directly be tokenized, but legal entities can. Each property is owned by a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC). Each LLC is tokenized to specific RealTokens and made available for purchase. Daily Rent Payments With blockchains, we no longer need to wait 30 days to receive a bank transfer. Owning property with RealT allows you to collect rent every day. Rent is paid using a US-Dollar stablecoin, sent directly to the Ethereum wallet that owns the property\u2019s RealToken. Rent payments are automatically sent to investors Who\u2019s talking about RealT?
