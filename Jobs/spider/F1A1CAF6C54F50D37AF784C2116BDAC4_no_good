Â  It\u2019s urgent that we accelerate access to locally produced food.\" Guillaume, CEO of Agricool \"Students have been sent home. We\u2019ve decided to make their educational videos, quizzes, info sheets and more available, for just one euro.\" Shannon,Â  CEO ofÂ Schoolmouve \u201cSince the beginning of the corona crisis, we\u2019ve been offering MyDiabby to doctors for free, so that patients don\u2019t need to go to the hospital.\u201d Anastasia, CEO of MyDiabby \"In case of hospitalization, freelancers are covered by Wemind.\" Hind,Â CEO ofÂ Wemind \u201cMany freelancers will need cash soon.

WeÂ encourage, back, believe in founders even when hardly anyone sees theÂ potential in their vision. Then we get to see them grow, learn, and devoteÂ all of their timeÂ to building. Some keep growing, others fail - but come what may, they are the ones who take most responsibility for it.Â So weÂ can understand theÂ bitter tasteÂ when it all stops, especially for unexpected external reasons - like a pandemic. But let\u2019s not be dramatic,Â let\u2019sÂ take one step back.Â Determination can also called obsession when it hides the bigger picture: being aliveÂ is more important than making any business succeed. AndÂ losing is part of the business game.Â  Today, we can\u2019t move around,Â we can\u2019t prevent the worldÂ economy fromÂ collapsing, and weÂ can\u2019t anticipate what\u2019s gonna happen next. What can we do as entrepreneurs? We can transform, we can help, we can reinvent. Some founders areÂ restructuring the company, cutting costs, makingÂ decisions to adapt to the moment. We\u2019reÂ seeingÂ entrepreneurs rapidly reshapingÂ their businesses. Some are still growing their companies right now and are using their leading positionÂ to boost others. And a lot of them are spontaneouslyÂ contributingÂ to the fight against coronavirus. In the end, all we need right now is courage, imagination, optimism and care, and that's the mainÂ message of The Family. Daring minds, you\u2019re more than welcome toÂ join. OPEN HOTLINE ASPIRING OR SERIAL ENTREPRENEURS WILLING TO GET IN TOUCH, THE FAMILY DEDICATES THIS HOTLINE TO YOU. OUR DIRECTORSÂ BALTH & MATHIAS ARE OPEN FOR OFFICE HOURS :Â  ANYONE CAN BOOK A SLOT.
