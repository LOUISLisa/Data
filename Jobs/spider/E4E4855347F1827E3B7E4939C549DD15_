Reuben Jackson 28 November, 2018 Glassdoor Economic Research A study by Glassdoor found that demand for blockchain work has risen 300% since last year. Glassdoor reported the median starting salary for blockchain job openings was over $32,000 higher than the median US salary, an increase of 61.8%. Despite the issues in the current crypto market, blockchain technology appears to have a bright future. For those in the United States, the economy continues to push forward full steam ahead. According to a recent jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the month of October, the US economy added 250,000 jobs to reach an unemployment level of 3.7%, extending a record streak of 97 consecutive months of growth. That's great news for Americans in the job market as unemployment maintains a steady 49-year low; however, there's one area of the economy that's seeing even more growth: blockchain-related jobs. A recent study from Glassdoor found that blockchain-related job openings in the US have increased 300% compared to last year and that the salaries are growing too. Even with the drastic price drop in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, those with blockchain skills are a hot commodity in the tech workforce. Growth in demand Glassdoor's study found a significant increase in demand from employers looking for talent in the blockchain space even after the price of bitcoin dropped dramatically. As of August 2018, the website reported 1,775 unique blockchain-related job opening in the US. That number represents a 300% year-over-year increase from 2017. The good news for those in the workforce is that the numbers remained essentially unaffected by bitcoin price volatility. During the so-called \"crypto-mania\" bull run that occurred during the end of 2017, Glassdoor calculated unique position openings in the range of 695 - 748, compared to the current openings which more than double that. Regardless of the volatility in the markets, employers are still seeking talent in the blockchain space like never before. Further contributing to the data is Upwork's Q1 2018 Skills Index, which ranks the 20 fastest-growing skill sets for freelancers and companies looking for contractors. According to the report, blockchain was the number one fastest-growing skill set. Job compensation Besides a growing number of employers looking for blockchain talent, there's more good news for those in the space: the pay. While those with technical skills already tend to command higher than average salaries, job openings in the blockchain space are offering significantly higher salaries than most others. Glassdoor reported the median starting salary for blockchain job openings was $84,884 compared to the median salary in the US of $52,461. The difference in salaries is substantial, to say the least, at over $32,000 higher than the median US salary, an increase of 61.8%. The burgeoning field in the tech sector is offering such high salaries for a few reasons, including the lack of available talent in blockchain and the locations of the jobs themselves, with major metropolitan areas topping the list of locations for job openings. Location and skills Golden Gate Bridge upload.wikimedia.org One of the reasons for such high starting pay with job openings is due to where the jobs are located. As is often the case with the tech world, major cities like New York City and San Francisco top the list of American cities with blockchain job openings, followed by expected locations like San Jose, Chicago, Seattle, Boston and Los Angeles. Outside the United States, other international hubs are seeking blockchain talent as well. London, Singapore, Toronto, and Hong Kong claim the top of the list for blockchain job openings in the international job markets. The variety of companies looking for workers in the space is huge as well, and companies such as IBM, Facebook, JPMorgan and many others are only a few of the names in the mix. With higher average cost of living, larger salaries are a way for companies to incentivise talent to come to them, but what type of talent are they looking for? Chai Shepherd is an advisor to the Resto project, a blockchain solution for food services, and Co-Founder of PLAAK, a project aimed at making blockchain implementation easier. He is a well-known crypto investor and has a lot of experience finding new talent. Through his experience in the industry, Shepherd has noticed particular skills that stand out to employers and innovators and knows that it's not always easy to find skilled developers. \"Blockchain companies are looking for Internet-of-Things (IoT), Java, Javascript, C++, and Golang developers, as well as for those with knowledge in cryptographic algorithms. However, developers are getting harder to find as a lot of this type of work is mainly research and development (R&D) that's not normally required in a technology organization. Universities are currently teaching solidity code, but I feel that there is more to blockchain than just ETH solidity smart contracts.\" Also included in Glassdoor's research is the type of talent employers are looking to attract. According to the data, software engineering is the most sought-after occupation, which is unsurprising as more companies look to implement blockchain technology into their platforms. Software engineer listings alone accounted for nearly 20% of all job opening postings on Glassdoor related to blockchain technology. Other sought-after positions included analyst relations manager, product manager, front-end engineer, and technology architect, though all in the single-digit percentages of openings. So, what does all this mean? For starters, insights from Glassdoor show that even with the hefty volatility of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices, blockchain technology appears to be staying relevant. In fact, listings for blockchain-related job openings have only increased (by a lot) after the drastic decline in the cryptocurrency markets. That's good news for those interested in the field of study and work. Additionally, the research shows that employers value knowledgeable individuals enough to offer much higher starting pay for those with the know-how to help implement blockchain technology. For a nascent industry like cryptocurrencies, the research comes not so much as a surprise, but as an affirmation for the future of the industry to come. What we're seeing happen is following a similar pattern in the tech world for those with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning skills. Though the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies remains unclear in the US, the growth in the industry related to the underlying technology is not. Looking forward, the blockchain industry is poised to continue its rapid growth.

OpenStax reimagined textbooks and saved students $1 billion. Now is a moment to reimagine even more. How can education help students learn more, better, and faster? Richard Baraniuk 18 June, 2020 Photo: Klaus Vedfelt / Getty Images Sponsored by Charles Koch Foundation In 2012, I founded OpenStax as a then-radical solution to the Great Recession: Why not make college textbooks free for students? And why not make them open-licensed? Now we are faced with COVID-19, another crisis of enormous scale\u2014and one that is once again underscoring the harsh inequities in our communities and accelerating the existing gap between the haves and the have-nots. Student engagement and open education are the next frontiers that innovators must address if we want education to live up to its promise as the great equalizer. <p>I still cannot get over how much the world has changed in the past few months. We have seen an upheaval in education across our nation and around the globe with tremendous impacts on students, teachers, and our workforce. School and college closures have sent millions of students home to study remotely in hastily prepared online courses. And unemployment is reaching Great Depression levels, with millions of workers looking to upskill and re-enter the now rapidly changing job market. Education is supposed to be the \"great equalizer.\" Yet, COVID-19 has underscored the harsh inequities in our communities and accelerated the existing gap between the haves and the have-nots. I expect that things will never quite be the same.</p> <blockquote>I founded OpenStax in 2012 as a then-radical solution: Why not make college textbooks free for students? And why not make them open-licensed so that faculty could easily customize them to create the perfect course?</blockquote> <p>The economic impacts of the current crisis remind me of the Great Recession that followed the financial collapse of 2008. Then, as now, students were looking to our nation's colleges to rebuild their lives. But their situation was aggravated by skyrocketing college textbook prices, which by 2012 had risen <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-college-textbook-bubble-and-how-the-open-educational-resources-movement-is-going-up-against-the-textbook-cartel/\" target=\"_blank\">more than 800%</a> over the previous three decades to hundreds of dollars. It is not an exaggeration that college students were having to decide between buying a textbook or groceries.</p><p>In response to this crisis, I founded <a href=\"https://openstax.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenStax</a> in 2012 as a then-radical solution: Why not make college textbooks free for students? And why not make them open-licensed so that faculty could easily customize them to create the perfect course? Leveraging the Connexions digital textbook publishing platform I had been developing at Rice University since 1999 and building an editorial team comprising leading college educators funded by forward-thinking philanthropists, we published our first five textbooks.</p><p>Today, OpenStax's library of 40 textbooks covers most of the introductory college courses and has saved students nearly $1 billion. This past school year, 3.4 million students used these texts across 60 per cent of all US degree-granting institutions and many high school classrooms. We have seen true market disruption, as prices dropped for the first time in history starting in 2017, which has largely been attributed to OpenStax and the open education movement. Free and open texts have gone mainstream, they're no longer radical; they simply make sense for students.</p> <img type=\"lazy-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzQwMzQ4NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxMjAzNDA2OX0.iitAn2YZ2-4cKHiLPdZ7EHdsQS5PmuDCIys7Wm8uSwk/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=380%2C838%2C0%2C4&height=700\" id=\"82426\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"40a73f379e0ea8fa7199f25bddd5fae9\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" /> Digital versions of OpenStax textbooks. Photo: Jemel Agulto, OpenStax <p>In the face of COVID-19, OpenStax is experiencing an unprecedented demand for free resources and a first-of-its-kind experiment in online education. OpenStax's students and instructors have doubled during the pandemic as compared to the same period last year. Instructors have rapidly transitioned online, restructuring courses and learning new technologies and practices. In response, we are focused on meeting faculty and students where they are at this moment, creating an express lane to quickly and easily integrate our resources into their online learning platforms. Additionally, we are partnering with the <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/Charles-Koch-Foundation/teacher-education\" target=\"_self\">Association of College and University Educators</a> to infuse our materials with research-based best practices around engagement to support teaching and learning for the benefit of all students, rather than just a few. The real test will come down to impacting student engagement at a time when there are rising gaps in equitable opportunities.</p> <p>Students don't learn if they're not engaged. In a traditional course, we may lose a student's attention in 15 minutes; online this narrows to mere seconds. We need to develop interactions that better reflect a new reality in which learning takes place in shorter cycles and in which bursts of activity break the monotony. Brief activities, videos, peer review, dynamic discussions, and rapid review need to be used in a consistent and predictable manner for students. The implementation of these engaging experiences will vary from class to class. So we need highly modularized solutions that work globally to scale but act locally to meet the unique needs of instructors and deepen engagement for their students.</p><p>As the nation now faces increased tensions, changes, and anxieties, it is hard to see bright spots ahead. Yet, perhaps now more than ever, this is a moment to reimagine education. What if students could better understand themselves as learners\u2014could that spark curiosity and motivation? What if teachers were supported in using data to personalize experiences and interventions for all their students, rather than just a few? These would be huge advances. If we want education to be the great equalizer, then it's time to double-down on open education models that drive toward student engagement.</p> <a href=\"https://openstax.org/\" ><img type=\"lazy-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzQwMzQ5MS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNjE3MzIwNn0.fCKYGxoUqOhrzRNMSuY2cZyGI9fMqpUnmMDS24Yppcs/img.png?width=980\" id=\"30b70\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"29fdb2eea1680127fa72a5048be07e31\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" /></a> Image: Courtesy of OpenStax Keep reading Show less education books innovation learning coronavirus poverty inequality Popular Sex & Relationships Masturbation boosts your immune system, helping you fight off infection and illness \u200bIn 1983, Isaac Asimov predicted the world of 2019.

Getty Images Surprising Science The supervolcano in Yellowstone National Park could cause an \"ultra-catastrophe,\" warns an extinction events writer. The full eruption of the volcano last happened 640,000 years ago. The blast could kill billions and make United States uninhabitable. <p><br></p></div> <p>If there weren't enough cataclysms to worry about, a recently published book brought another terrible possibility back into the public spotlight. Among other calamities, Bryan Walsh's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/End-Times-Brief-Guide-World/dp/031644961X\" target=\"_blank\">\"End Times\"</a> highlights the eruption of the Yellowstone supervolcano in the United States as an event that could wipe out much of human life on this planet.</p><p>Thankfully, the Yellowstone volcano in Wyoming doesn't erupt very often. The last time it did so was <strong>640,000</strong> years ago. Certainly, no one knows when it will blow again, but by some measures it could happen at any point. </p><p>When it does happen, the eruption would propel something like <strong>240 cubic miles </strong>of rock, dust and ash into the sky, like it did during the last major explosion. It would also create a flow of magma that would bury the area within a <strong>40-mile radius.</strong> Chunks of Colorado, Wyoming and Utah would end up under up to <strong>three feet of ash</strong>. Parts of the Midwest would be covered in at least a few inches of such ash, becoming dark. And if you think that already doesn't sound good, the emission of dust and toxic gases like sulphur monoxide into the atmosphere would create an acidic veil around the planet reflecting sunlight. This would lead to a dramatic cooling of the global climate that would last at least several years.</p> <img type=\"lazy-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMTA2NTc1Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwNzAwNjU4MX0.lqr39IylCbBDv8HabpXjTgAsBcctljgCiZt6nw-nnJE/img.jpg?width=980\" id=\"12b36\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"629e0c291c2e54c59b84248212b9a476\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" /> Volcanic ash eruption.

As Bryan Walsh writes in his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/opinion/supervolcano-yellowstone.html\" target=\"_blank\">op-ed in the New York Times</a>, a 2015 report for the European Science Foundation on extreme geohazards called what might happen <strong>\"the greatest catastrophe since the dawn of civilization.\"</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Jerzy ????????????aba, </strong>a geologist from the University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland, was even more specific, <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1127611/Yellowstone-volcano-eruption-kill-billions-yellowstone-fallout-supervolcano-news\" target=\"_blank\">saying in an interview</a> that in his estimate, around <strong>5 billion people</strong> would die from hunger \"due to the effects of climate change.\" If Yellowstone blows, he suggests that to survive, the only thing to do would be to flee North America. Imagine, American refugees trying to get into South America or Europe.</p><p>Bryan Walsh calls this scenario, without much exaggeration, an \"existential risk\" not just to the U.S., but the world at large. Walsh <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/opinion/supervolcano-yellowstone.html\" target=\"_blank\">writes</a> that \"existential risk experts largely agree that supervolcanoes \u2014 of which there are <strong>20</strong> scattered around the planet \u2014 are the natural threat that poses the highest probability of human extinction.\"</p> <!-- Insticator API Embed --><div id=\"insticator-container\"><div id=\"div-insticator-ad-3\"></div><div id=\"insticator-embed\" embed-id=\"2322208d-07e2-47bf-9c47-dc6fa0232551\"></div><div id=\"div-insticator-ad-4\"></div><script data-cfasync='false' type=\"text/javascript\">Insticator.ad.loadAd(\"div-insticator-ad-3\");Insticator.ad.loadAd(\"div-insticator-ad-4\");Insticator.load(\"em\",{id : \"2322208d-07e2-47bf-9c47-dc6fa0232551\"});</script></div><!-- End Insticator API Embed --> <img type=\"lazy-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMTA2NTc1OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwOTEyMzg0NH0.76SDjiMDgSo_Qi4yqawnU4fSOxPH1QFsrEtadCzIKA4/img.jpg?width=980\" id=\"57ef9\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"eed03a7716630f2204ff7f7033554bf2\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" /> Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States. May 2016. Credit: Russell Pearson/Getty Images <p>The big question, of course, is when will the Yellowstone supervolcano erupt? The seismically active area in the Yellowstone National Park gets about <strong>3,000 </strong><a href=\"https://yellowstone.net/geology/earthquakes/\" target=\"_blank\">small earthquakes</a> a year, but the catastrophic blasts are infrequent. Besides the so-called \"Lava Creek eruption\" 640K years ago, the volcano fully exploded approximately <strong>1.3 million and 2.1 million </strong>years ago, which means there are about 660,000 to 800,000 years in between.</p><p>Of course, no one knows when it will happen next for sure, which is why Walsh believes more resources need to be dedicated to the study of volcanos. Currently, the FAA spends about $7 billion every year on aviation safety while volcano programs, which can potentially cause much more massive casualties, get a paltry $22 million in study expenditures.</p> Keep reading Show less natural disasters nature climate change public health geology history united states Europe to ban American travel as U.S. struggles to contain pandemic The European Union is debating over two lists of nations from which it will accept travelers starting July 1.

This system has been identified as a factor in <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bffz\" target=\"_blank\">why voter turnout is often low.</a> Many people simply don't know how to register, others don't know that they need to, and still more cannot be bothered to do so. </p><p>However, a new <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-020-09625-2\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> seeking new ways to improve voter turnout at low cost has found that voter turnout can be substantially increased among those who begin as unregistered for little more than the price of a postage stamp. </p> How to get people to register to vote without breaking the bank<p>The study, carried out by political scientists from major American universities with the State of Pennsylvania's assistance, sent postcards to eligible but unregistered (EBU) Pennsylvanians to see if they would register to vote at higher rates than those who were not sent a card.</p><p>Pennsylvania is part of the <a href=\"https://ericstates.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Electronic Registration Information Center</a> (ERIC) collection of states. This group, consisting of several states and Pew Charitable trusts, exists to improve registration rates and voter rolls' accuracy. The states in ERIC all agreed to make serious efforts to reach out to at least 95 percent of all of their eligible but unregistered voters before each election. This means that they have a list of these people, something other states lack.</p><p>Taking advantage of this situation, the authors of the study devised a variety of postcards to send to EBUs to satisfy the state's obligations to mail out to the required 95 percent of EBUs and used the remaining 5 percent as a control group. </p><p>The simplest postcards explained how easy it was to register to vote online and provided the required web address. More complicated versions included a QR code option and a section explaining that online registration was created in response to voter demand. All of them were designed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of State and had the hallmarks of an officially sanctioned, state-issued mailer. <br> <br> The EBUs who were to be contacted were randomly assigned to groups getting one of four possible postcard designs. After the election, the researchers were able to see that the groups that received mailers of any kind registered at a rate of around 8 percent, compared to 7 percent of those who did not receive any postcard. The rate at which those who registered and ultimately voted was similar in all groups. The increase in voter registration was particularly substantial for younger voters, a historically tricky demographic to motivate. </p><p>There was little difference in the turnout of those who got the simple postcard and those who got the complex ones or those with specific phrasing. The authors suggest that this means the reminder and essential information are what's vital to maximizing turnout by this method. </p><p>Now, while a 1 percent overall improvement might seem low, remember that the control group had a measly 7 percent turnout. That 1 percent overall improvement represents a significant increase in comparison. In an election where turnout nationally was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election\" target=\"_blank\">just over 50 percent</a> and 60 percent in Pennsylvania, that increase is noteworthy.</p><p>It is even more impressive when you remember that Pennsylvania's electoral votes were decided by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election_in_Pennsylvania\" target=\"_blank\">a fraction of a percent</a> last time. </p> This is great and all, but what can I do with this information? <div class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-media_id=\"EdaCjUI1\" data-player_id=\"FvQKszTI\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"97857a380f30c2428a28b18a576e45b8\"> <div id=\"botr_EdaCjUI1_FvQKszTI_div\" class=\"jwplayer-media\" data-jwplayer-video-src=\"https://content.jwplatform.com/players/EdaCjUI1-FvQKszTI.js\"> <img src=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/EdaCjUI1-1920.jpg\" class=\"jwplayer-media-preview\" /> </div> <script src=\"https://content.jwplatform.com/players/EdaCjUI1-FvQKszTI.js\"></script> </div> <p>The authors suggest that their findings have several implications for people trying to get out the vote and political scientists more broadly, writing in the study:</p><p>\"We find that a <em>single</em> postcard sent by state election officials several weeks before the election can produce meaningful increases in both registration and turnout. Even in the context of Pennsylvania, a hotly contested swing state which ranked third in terms of campaign visits by the 2016 presidential and vice-presidential candidates, contact by state officials appeared to reach individuals who had not yet been contacted or persuaded to register by the campaigns or other mobilization groups.\"</p><p>They suggest that further study is needed, as there is a limited amount of literature on registration drives in compilation to attempts to turn out already registered voters. </p><p>More broadly, these findings lend credence to the idea that very many people who don't vote would like to, or at least would, if given the right information. This will prove useful to those trying to improve voter turnout. More importantly, once registered, most of these people ended up voting. </p><p>However, it must also be remembered that the percentage of notified people who registered in the end was still abysmally low\u2014suggesting that many people who are not registered have more complicated reasons for not signing up to vote.</p><p>American voter turnout is low. This study shows that a simple postcard can help raise voter turnout without turning to solutions that would alter how registration and voting are done. Given the importance that Americans place on their democratic traditions, perhaps some people can expect a postcard from their Uncle Sam before too long.</p> Keep reading Show less united states politics democracy voting Coronavirus What is an immunity passport and could it work?
