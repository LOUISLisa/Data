    "Body": "You need to enable JavaScript to run this app. A seller or shop stakes the DTH token to become visible on the Dether map so that buyers can find them. By requiring sellers and shops to put up a safety deposit based how much they trade, we discourage fraudulent vendors from setting up shop while protecting buyers at the same time. We support committed and upstanding vendors in the community, both small and large. Therefore, staked DTH will generate loyalty points for the vendors based on their transaction history. Loyalty points can be spent to unlock special features, such as increased visibility on the Dether map and the right to collect affiliate fees on certain trades. Anyone can build on the Dether platform. In the spirit of transparency, we have developed an open standard for add-on services for use by Dether vendors. With the full backing of the Dether infrastructure, developers can build new dApps compatible with Dether accounts and may also request access to stake amounts, transaction histories, loyalty points, and more. As Blockchain technology is spreading across the globe, more and more businesses are accepting cryptocurrency. Whether you\u2019re looking for a sandwich shop in Bueno Aires, a deli in Melbourne or a camera in Japan, check out your Dether map to discover places near your where cryptocurrency is now accepted.
