AVA????????????Labs is backed by: What can you do? Launch customized blockchains, private & public With Avalanche, you can deploy blockchains that fit your own application needs. Build your own virtual machine and dictate exactly how the blockchain should operate. Create and trade digital assets \u200d Avalanche enables the launching of smart assets or digital representations of real-world-assets that obey special parameters and trading restrictions. Better than any other platform. Build scalable smart contracts and dapps \u200d By leveraging the Avalanche protocol, developers can launch smart contracts that confirm in a second and scale to thousands or millions of validators, far beyond any other blockchain platform today. Solutions Key features High performance Avalanche finalizes transactions in about a second and clears thousands per second. This makes high-volume P2P payments and asset transfers a reality. Scalable and secure The platform can accommodate thousands to millions of participants. The protocol is green and sustainable, and there is no mining. You probably already have the hardware required to join the network. Flexible and customizable Each blockchain launched on Avalanche can define its own core logic and validator set. This means compliance and privacy by default. Why Avalanche? What do we tackle? The 30k-foot view The Problem Financial markets are siloed, and don't interoperate. AVA is designed for the creation, issuance, and trading of digital assets. Whereas existing financial assets are siloed, AVA provides a universal, cross-blockchain platform where diverse assets can coexist with their own rules. We ask a simple question: what if we could digitize and network all assets? Current solutions leave a lot to be desired. Blockchains can enable tokenization of assets. However, current blockchain architectures do not interoperate, scale, or provide the right legal foundations. The Solution AVA????????????provides the right foundations. The platform provides a blazingly fast consensus engine to power each blockchain, and architecturally breaks free from the monolithic design of current blockchains, allowing developers to customize their blockchains in full. 1. A Powerful ????????????Engine for Global, Real-Time Demand The AVA platform features a powerful set of technologies that allow one to exchange at blazing speeds and in a highly secure way. Powering the AVA platform is the Avalanche consensus protocol. Consensus Engine 2. A Flexible, Customizable Architecture One can deploy custom-made subnets, such as new chains, within AVA that follow special covenants.Developers can wholesale move existing Dapps, as well as build new types of highly expressive assets that run intelligently and obey custom rules.The platform supports magical features such as reactive smart assets that observe network changes, subnets that obey specific rules, covenants and riders, and composable (micro)services that augment financial services to whole new levels. For Developers Avalanche enables the deployment of new blockchains with their own virtual machines, validator sets, scripting languages, legal compliance rules, and more. Avalanche supports all existing Dapps written in Solidity, with higher performance and much quicker finality. Coming soon:DocumentationAPI????????????ReferenceTutorials 1) Smart Assets and Contracts These are powerful processes that autonomously interact with other assets based on internal business logic. These processes have the ability to monitor and automatically react to specific network changes. 2) Subnets In just a few steps, you can provision new private, public, permissioned or permissionless blockchains, called subnets. 3) Flexible, Composable VMs We introduce the concept of Avalanche Virtual Machines, which enable developers to easily launch blockchains with a wide array of application-specific features.
