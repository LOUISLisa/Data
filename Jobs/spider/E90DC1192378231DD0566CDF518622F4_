However, a new report has revealed an increase in the number of cryptocurrency and blockchain job openings amid the layoffs.\u00c2\u00a0 According to a Forbes report, job postings with positions related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies such as Software Engineer, Developer, Software Architect, and many more, increased by 8.73% in March.\u00c2\u00a0 The report also cited data from Indeed, an American search engine for job listings, which revealed some multinational companies including Coinbase, Facebook, Ripple, and JP Morgan Chase hiring for vacancies related to blockchain. Remote crypto jobs up 42.86%\u00c2\u00a0 Job postings for remote roles related to crypto also increased by a whopping 42.86%. For instance, Kraken, a US-based cryptocurrency exchange, had an initial plan to hire 250 people in 2020, mainly because of the upcoming halving. However, as a result of the pandemic gearing people\u2019s attention to digital alternatives, the company decided to increase the number to 350 and also move up the hiring timeline. Speaking on this, Kraken\u2019s CEO and co-founder, Jesse Powell, said, \u201cthe traditional system seems to be completely breaking down all over the world. So, increased customer demand is going to mean increased business for us, and it\u2019s going to mean increased hiring.\u201d More recently, the exchange has resorted to hiring relatives of its employees as a way to prevent employees from worrying about the impact of the Coronavirus crisis on close friends and family members. Kraken, however, does not just hire anyone seeking a random job. Instead, it hires those who are genuinely interested in cryptocurrencies and have an understanding of how the industry works. San Francisco-based crypto exchange Coinbase was also on a hiring spree. The company had posted on its official website an opening of about 100 positions in its offices across the United States, Europe, and Asia. According to the CEO, Brian Amstrong, \u201cthere has never been a better time for people around the world to learn about sound money and a more global, fair, financial system powered by cryptocurrency.\u201d Tweet Share Reddit Share Stumble Share Share Pin it Blockchain Coinbase Kraken Related Posts Unstoppable Domains Unveils .Crypto Domains to Serve as Payment Gateway NEO Blockchain Receives $100 Million Funding Adoption: QANPlatform Integrates Chainlink\u2019s Decentralized Oracle Network Coinbase Wallet Users Can Now Easily Earn Interests on DeFi Apps GUIDES Does Ethereum Have Halving?
