Here is a list of job boards that let you post jobs for free. It includes job boards like Indeed, Ziprecruiter, etc. Read for more!

As an experienced professional who has joined a community of similar professional I would expect positivity, especially considering our ties to the HR Culture. Thanks for the post. level 2 2 points Â· 5 months ago yea, I upvoted it so quickly. I thinkkkk maybe I know why someone would downvote. Indeed is pointless without sponsoring. LinkedIn groups are cool but actual job postings on LinkedIn are super expensive. As a long time redditor and recruiter I'd love to recruit on reddit more but I've never successfully filled a job using Reddit. Actually I've only been downvoted every time I mention a job on reddit. level 2 Moderator2 points Â· 5 months ago Some people are looking at this as spam. It's definitely click bate for this persons blog, but I looked through the list and saw a bunch of resources I use. So, I let it through. But, considering 9/10 of these types of posts are complete garbage... level 1 1 point Â· 5 months ago Thank you for this informative post. Keep sharing the valuable information like this. level 1 1 point Â· 5 months ago How about recruiting agency based sites? how did you fare with those? level 1 1 point Â· 5 months ago Am I missing something with Ziprecruiter? I can't seem to post an ad at all without entering credit card information and it says you have 4 days to cancel. I guess technically you can post a job for free for 4 days. That is really stretching being on a list of top free job sites. Does someone have a trick I don't know about? At least Indeed will tell you an unsponsored ad is still posted even though it's buried so far down that it's almost pointless to use it for free. level 1 1 point Â· 1 month ago The majority of those job boards are not free. Can we define what we mean by free? Does not require a credit card No limits on job postings Doesn't required any sort of reciprocal activity like sharing a link, etc. to post for free Must be accessible to any user/business (in other words you have to be able to navigate to the site, and post a job (or many)) Looking at that list the only ones that may qualify are: - Angellist - Facebook - jake level 1 1 point Â· 1 month ago Thanks for posting, that's a nice list. Some of those sites aren't 'truly' free in my opinion as they offer trials or other 'gotchas'. Perhaps you could get Get.It to your list next time around? We are a 100% free job posting platform with no catches, trials or 'gotchas'.
