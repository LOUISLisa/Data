The recruitment industry is fragmented anywhere in the world. The reason is that the recruiters want to find the best matching candidates no matter where they are. Thus recruiters post jobs on various sites. Similarly, the candidates want to find the right jobs that suit their criteria no matter which job boards they are listed in.

The reason is that the recruiters want to find the best matching candidates no matter where they are. Thus recruiters post jobs on various sites. Similarly, the candidates want to find the right jobs that suit their criteria no matter which job boards they are listed in. It wouldn't do justice if I just list down the websites. For example, Naukri may not be the best place for finding an internship or startup job. Therefore let me divide the job sites into few categories and list few well-known players. Pure Play Traditional job boards which list jobs posted directly by recruiters. Top ones are(in no specific order): Naukri.com, TimesJobs, Shine.com, Monster India, CareerBuilder India, etc Job Aggregator The aggregators are job search engines. They crawl jobs posted on other job boards, company websites etc. Advantage: Will have a better coverage. Examples: Indeed, Simply Hired, Careerjet.co.in etc. This category is of particular interest to me. We at Pathway.ai also fall into the same category. Managerial Jobs Focuses only on high level management jobs. Examples: headhonchos.com and iimjobs.com Social Network Good for passive candidates. There is no competitor for LinkedIn at the moment. But Facebook is also working on it. Niche Job Sites These are focused on specific skills set or domains. For example, AngelList focuses on startups, Hasjob, Stackoverflow Jobs, and TechGig focus on technical jobs. Challenge Based Job Sites These websites pose competition to candidates and make the results available to companies. For example HackerRank, HackerEarth, and CodeFights. Kaggle only has competition as well as a job board. Internship Job like Internshala and Letsintern focus only on internships. Disclosure: I am the co-founder of Pathway.ai. The Pathway is a simpler approach to finding your next job. Instead of just keywords based job match, Pathway.ai uses the resume to match the jobs. Resumes are rich sources of information. The resume has details of your work experience, skill sets, interests, achievements, roles and responsibilities. Pathway.ai's intelligent algorithms that extract this information from resume and job description and recommends the best matching jobs. 274.6k views \u00c2\u00b7 View 263 Upvoters \u00c2\u00b7 View Sharers Related QuestionsMore Answers Below Is a fresher world job portal (e.g. Naukri.com) good for a job interview trial for a fresher?

It is becoming increasingly difficult for recent graduates from Indian universities to secure decent entry-level jobs. As a recent graduate myself, I have had quite some experience on various job search portals online to finally land myself a decent job. I will list my personal favourites below. Indeed is an extremely large database of jobs for most of the industries out there. What I like about Indeed is how easy it is to create a profile and start applying to jobs through their portal itself. You get instant (only important, personalized) emails about status updates which helps you keep track as well. Workex is a relatively unknown and new platform in the Indian market. After coming across the app, I was quite impressed with how easy it was to create a profile and directly start applying for jobs in many fields. What makes Workex stand out in my opinion is that you can be directly in contact with the recruiter of the company and even request a callback. As a result, the process of applying and getting shortlisted is much faster and more accurate. Because everything is on the mobile app, it\u2019s also easy to keep track of interviews that you have lined up as they send you push notification reminders and even WhatsApp messages. It is through Workex where I landed my job and I am thoroughly satisfied with my experience here. Naukri is a widely known Indian job portal that also compiles and aggregates vacancies from almost all industries in India. I really appreciated the range and extent of vacancies they had listed, it was more extensive than Indeed for example. However, you should be warned that some of the vacancies may not be credible or reliable and could be fake as a result. Monster India is also a well-known job portal site here in India, with a large database of existing jobs all over the country. I really liked that they provide you with a resume service so that you can tailor and improve your resume with expert tips. 5k views \u00c2\u00b7 View 4 Upvoters \u00c2\u00b7 View Sharers Susan Thomas, MBA Human Resources, The Ohio State University (2008) Updated Jan 21, 2020 Well, to be honest, \u2018The Top Indian Job Portal\u2019 meant for your specific work profile depends on the kind of approach you desire to take up!

No jobsplate is not indeed but is a Global Job Board open to any business, company, trust, group, individual etc to POST JOBS and APPLY for FREE!!! A job makes someone and a family earn livelihood. But not all the companies (big to small) post job opening ads online. Circumstantially and reluctantly they have to hire through other informal and ineffective channels as posting an attractive job opening ad on top online job boards is very expensive. Indeed, it is expensive! A job ad costs from $49 to $1999+ on different job boards (See Price Matrix). Why spend so much money when there is an option to post job openings for 60 days FREE indefinitely!!! You must be thinking, hmm another job portal!! Read below to know, why we started? Posting a job opening online is NOT rocket science BUT then why is it so expensive??? $299+ for posting a job opening for 30 days, are you kidding me?!!! For $299 you can sponsor education or food of an un-priviledged child for almost 12 months. See below images. Recruitment is a major problem for all businesses as finding and retaining the right talent is a top concern. Even if your compensation and benefits are on par, if not better, than your competitors, but still you just can't seem to find the right people. Thus, you need to keep on posting job openings constantly and keep on seeking the right talent. It is a continous process. Job Ad Advertising is expensive? Oh yeah damn it is! Examples of pricing structure for posting job opening ads on few famous job boards: In US, to post an ad on CareerBuilder costs $419. If you post 5 jobs per month, you can get it down to $350/job. At Monster, a single job ad is $395. If you post 5 jobs per month, you can get that down to $320/job. With costs like these--that often deliver mediocre results--you may want to consider another approach to finding candidates. Careerbuilder Advertising a job \u2013 especially on major job boards \u2013 is expensive. On Seek, Australia\u2019s leading job posting board costs $275 +GST at a minimum for only 30 days. If you add in any of their special features, the costs add up to over $1000. SEEK - Australia's no. 1 jobs, employment, career and recruitment site That is for one job board, and only for 30 days. On CareerOne, it\u2019s a bit cheaper at $187 to start for 30 days, but you get fewer applicants and once you start adding additional features, it adds up even more. In India, Jobs - Recruitment - Job Search - Employment - Job Vacancies - Naukri.com charges a good enough price as per Indian standards. Rs 1650/- for a job post for 30 days. Naukri India Most websites charge similar fees, and most businesses advertise on multiple websites. Already, we\u2019re at over $1000, and this doesn\u2019t include if you advertise with: Google Adwords Newspaper Ads Magazine Ads The more places you advertise, the more expensive it becomes. But the costs do not end there either. In order to advertise a job successfully, you have to monitor applicants, screen applicants, use tools to make sure you\u2019re getting the right applicants, and dedicate staff to all of these advertisement solutions. Before you have called your first applicant in for an interview, the costs in both expenses and lost production are often well over $5,000 per job opening.

What\u2019s there in name anyways? Let me begin by throwing light on how is it different from the rat race leaders & followers. Logical & beefed up privacy Your contact information will only be shared with the job publishers (or hirers) on whose jobs you choose to apply. If you missed applying for a job and its publisher finds your online resume (on the portal in picture), only your academic & experience details will be readily visible. Yes, your contact information will not be visible. That job publisher will have to send you an invite to apply. Invite to apply request will trigger an email to you with the link to their job description on this website. If you like it, apply for it. Once you hit the \u2018apply\u2019 button, only then your contact information will be shared. If however, you like to pass on it, simply ignore. That recruiter will not be able to call or email you! More promising & powerful application Now is the time to talk about the \u2018meaty\u2019 benefit of the portal in discussion. The moment you apply for a job there, along with your resume snippet & contact details, your 90 seconds answer (audio) to tell me about yourself will be shared as well. Try leaving no stone unturned in sounding confident & carry \u2018a positive attitude\u2019 while you record your answer. Good thing is, when you apply for your first job on this job portal, someone from their backend team will review your audio and give you a feedback or two, if at all you need them. The bottom line is to make your audio a stepping stone to landing at the premises of your next employer for a personal interview. Learn about critical & decisive information instantly This job portal has made it mandatory for recruiters to mention precise monthly take home salary, shift timing, weekly offs, and of course, detailed job description; on every job published. It is simple. Job listing cannot be submitted without mentioning about salary, offs & timings.
