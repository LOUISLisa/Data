More about the cohesion policy in Slovenia: www.eu-skladi.si. Using blockchain in your dapp has never been easier 0xcert API was purposely built to speed up adoption of blockchain technologies, since it provides the same versatile functionality as the 0xcert Framework, but is much easier to work with and requires much less development expertise. With an API Dashboard everything becomes even more transparent and givers you overview of everything that\u2019s going on with your app. Access API Dashboard Explore the advantages for your use case Decentralization and blockchain add great value to a variety of industries, use cases, and operations. Certificates & Licenses Contracts & Agreements Education Credentials Supply Chain & Logistics Physical & Digital Art Fashion and Design Digital & In-game Collectibles Collectibles & Rare Items Add blockchain assets to your project using decentralized API Integrate digital assets functionality into your existing application in seconds with just a few lines of code. import { Cert } from '@0xcert/cert';\nimport { schema88 } from '@0xcert/conventions';\n\nconst metadata = {\n  $schema: 'https://0xcert.org/conventions/88-crypto-collectible.json',\n  $evidence: 'https://troopersgame.com/dog/evidence.json',\n  name: 'Magic Sword',\n  description: 'Deadly weapon which can severely injure the enemy.',\n  image: 'https://troopersgame.com/dog.jpg',\n};\nconst cert = new Cert({\n  schema: schema88,\n});\nconst schemaId = await cert.identify();\nconst evidence = await cert.notarize(metadata);\nconst imprint = await cert.imprint(metadata);\n CertifyIssueVerify Specify the data that represent your asset, create a corresponding data object according to a JSON Schema and hash it into two digital proofs. The first, the Imprint, is hashed with the in-house developed ASH algorithm, and the second, the Evidence, is hashed with the revolutionary in-house developed AIH algorithm that enables advanced selective verification later on.
