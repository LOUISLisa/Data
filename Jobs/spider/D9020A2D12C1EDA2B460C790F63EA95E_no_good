A Leader in Mobile Voting \"The mobile voting registration was very easy to maneuver, and the ID verification process gave me confidence that the process was secure. When the ballot was available, I clicked through the candidates, hit \u2018Vote,\u2019 then used the thumb print Touch ID on my phone to verify who I was. That was it. Pretty slick!\" - Overseas Citizen Voter \"Our military personnel fight every day across the globe to protect our way of life. Whether a soldier is without mail in the mountains of Afghanistan, or a sailor is in a submarine under the polar icecap, they deserve the opportunity to participate easily in our democracy. We owe it to them to make the process as easy as possible.\" - Secretary of State, West Virginia \u201cWorking with Voatz has streamlined our registration and voting processes.
