You might\u2019ve stumbled upon my literary creations while searching for stuff on the internet. I write mostly on topics related to tech, crypto and such (although there was a period in my life when I wrote sarcastic descriptions for bizarre Amazon products). When my ADD kicks in I turn sticky notes into Pikachus or pop bubble wrap.
