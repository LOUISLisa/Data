Here\u2019s how you can stand out from the crowd and get hired. Josh Cottrell-Schloemer Follow May 31, 2018 \u00c2\u00b7 8 min read This article is written by the Comp Intel/Data Studio team at Cottrell Consulting Before we start: a pre-requisite for this guide is that you have a basic knowledge of blockchain technology. If you don\u2019t have that yet, start here with my list of free resources to learn about blockchain. Source So, you want to work for a blockchain company? Maybe you love crypto, or you believe in decentralization or even want to revolutionize the financial industry\u2026 whatever brought you here, I can tell you there\u2019s one hell of a job market for blockchain tech. There are WAY more positions available than can be filled. The industry is desperate for qualified candidates. \u201cIt\u2019s one of our biggest concerns. We can\u2019t find qualified talent. Every time a new position opens up we struggle, and that has pushed up our starting salaries and hourly rates for freelancers\u201d These high paying jobs aren\u2019t just for coders, either. Every position you can imagine is in demand: copywriters, community managers, sales execs, project managers, accounting, UI/UX\u2026 if you can think of it, there\u2019s someone hiring. Discover and review best Blockchain softwares Now, I can\u2019t tell you how to get hired for every type of job. But, I CAN give you a framework that can improve your odds. I\u2019ll do my best to open the door, but you need to walk through it. In summary, the steps are simple. It\u2019s just a matter of sticking to it. Be realistic about how much you actually know about blockchain technology \u2014most people drastically overestimate their knowledge Get focused. Pick a specific technology or project and learn the ins & outs. Get involved in the community. Talk to people that work on the project. Put the right skills on your LinkedIn. Make sure recruiters can find you Get yourself on BNTY & Upwork. Do freelance work. Build a portfolio. Volunteer. Work for free if you have to. Demonstrate your value. GET HIRED! So, let\u2019s get started. There\u2019s some prep work to do before you start applying for jobs. First, you need to get realistic about how much you actually know about blockchain technology. Employers are getting flooded with resum\u00c3\u00a9s from unqualified candidates. What does that tell you? It tells you there are a lot of people out there that drastically overestimate their skills. First, take a look at some of the free bitcoin/blockchain introduction courses. I prefer Berkeley\u2019s (all their coursework is available on their website and Youtube). Watch a few of the lectures and make sure you can follow along. If you\u2019re struggling, than you may need to learn a bit more. Start with: Free resources for non-coders to learn blockchain. Completing this step puts you ahead of 50% of blockchain job applicants. Almost half of applicants can\u2019t make it past a basic intro course about blockchain technologies. Choose a project and do your due diligence If you\u2019re interested in a specific project or cryptocurrency you need to do your crypto-due-diligence\u00e2\u0084\u00a2: read the whitepaper join the Telegram join the subreddit join the email list read any major news articles. If there\u2019s a spec page or wiki available, read it, even if you don\u2019t understand everything you read. Make sure you understand the topics people are discussing in the community. You DON\u2019T need to know how to code your own blockchain, but you DO need to understand how the core technology works and the value it brings to customers/users. This understanding of the core technology gives you a leg up for any type of job. Even an accountant or graphic designer needs to understand the core technology they are working with. This puts you ahead of 75% of applicants. Many applicants have little to no knowledge of the underlying technology and aren\u2019t active in a project\u2019s community . Get yourself out there \u2014 build a profile You\u2019ve got to get out there. Hit the dance floor and show them your moves. Start on Upwork. It has the most blockchain freelancing jobs for you to choose from. You need to build your portfolio and get some experience before applying to a full-time position. Learn how to write a strong profile. I suggest this site for guidance, the free articles cover everything you need to know. Learn how to send strong proposals. Here is some basic guidance. Start broad. You\u2019re looking for any blockchain related jobs that match your skill-set. Don\u2019t worry about focusing on one technology yet. You\u2019re just looking to start a portfolio with anything you can get. Stay entirely focused on keeping your clients happy. You\u2019re looking to get a few positive reviews. This will give you the credibility you need later on. Always tell clients you\u2019d like to work with them again and would appreciate any referrals. This could pay off later. This is all easier said than done. Don\u2019t get disheartened if it takes time. If you send out 20 proposals and can\u2019t get a job then 1) seriously review your profile and proposals and get a second opinion to make sure you\u2019re not making obvious mistakes and 2) move over to alpha.bounty0x.io and start completing jobs there. Keep track of your experience. Use them for your portfolio When all else fails write some articles. Struggling to build your portfolio? Can\u2019t get any freelance gigs? Can\u2019t find decent bounties? Then it\u2019s time to start writing. If you already have a blog, great. If not, start writing here on medium. It\u2019s easy to get started. Choose a blockchain topic you actually find interesting (this is important!). Readers can tell when you\u2019re excited about a topic. Write an informative piece on the topic you\u2019ve chosen. You\u2019re going for three things: be thorough, show your personality, and show off your talents. Use formatting, add images, and if you go deep on a subject make sure to keep it entertaining. You\u2019re goal is to keep the readers attention. This is now a piece you can use as an example of your work. It\u2019s an opportunity for you to tell a story about who you are and what you want to do. Building a portfolio puts you ahead of 85% of applicants. Many applicants have little to no portfolio work that\u2019s actually applicable to the job they apply to. Start volunteering. As soon as you have some work in your portfolio it\u2019s time to get involved with your favorite project. Communicate with folks that are involved in the project. Figure out where people working on the project are congregating. Sometimes they are on telegram, sometimes on reddit, sometimes on forums. Do your research and figure out where the most people hang out. Let them know you\u2019re interested in the project and would like to help. Show them you have experience. Offer to do some work for free. Ask for the best place to get involved. If you can\u2019t get anyone\u2019s attention than try doing some work on your own and post it publicly \u2014 if you\u2019re a writer then write an article, if you do social media then start up a social account, if you do marketing make some examples of marketing collateral. Show your value. Be so good they can\u2019t ignore you. This puts you ahead of 95% of applicants. Having actual volunteer work on a project shows real value and lets those hiring know that you\u2019re someone they can work with. Begin the job hunt Get your LinkedIn up to date. This lets people know your available, and gives you a professional profile recruiters can find. Make sure to include all applicable blockchain skills. Mention blockchain in your profile and include a sample project with your work. Now you\u2019re ready. First things first, try asking for a job. Reach out to a specific person in the department you want to work in. Don\u2019t email a generic jobs@____.com address. Tell them your interested, explain how you could add value, and ask them to keep you in mind if work becomes available. Keep it moderately casual. This works more often than you\u2019d expect. My experience is that you are more likely to get a job this way than by sending in a standard resume to an HR department. IMPORTANT: If that doesn\u2019t work out, then figure where the company posts new jobs. You\u2019re going to skip the standard resume/cover letter process and get straight to the people that matter. Watch like a hawk for new positions opening up. Follow social media accounts, telegram, etc. If you see a job posted that you\u2019re interested in, wait to send in a formal application. First, do some googling to figure out who you\u2019d be reporting to in the organization. Contact that person directly. There are lots of tricks for finding business email addresses, but the easiest is to search there name plus the company\u2019s web address in google. If that doesn\u2019t work, just google \u201chow to find someone\u2019s business email\u201d and try some of the other techniques. Don\u2019t mention the job posting when you email them, just tell them you\u2019re interested in the work they\u2019re doing and think you could add a lot of value to their team. This starts things off by setting you apart from the crowd. If you\u2019ve tried everything else and it hasn\u2019t worked, then you can try sending in a standard job application/cover letter. If you go this route you need to do your research and understand what the employer is looking for. 90% of getting hired with a standard job application is understanding what EXACTLY the employer wants. Most people focus on themselves and their personal strengths\u2026 this couldn\u2019t matter less. You need to focus on what they want, not what you like about yourself.
