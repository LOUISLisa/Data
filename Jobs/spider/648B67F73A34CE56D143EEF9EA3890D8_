An obsession with crypto and blockchain is a big plus. Keep cool and calm when things get intense. Â We\u2019re a startup environment in many senses of the word. Crazy hours, chaos, and quick pivots \u2014 but you\u2019re the type of designer who thrives in that. Are able to think forward into an incredible future that doesn\u2019t yet exist.
