REV is an ERC-20 token and the primary currency that will be used in F1Â® Delta Time.Â  \u200b When you choose to stake your car, you temporarily transfer ownership to F1Â® Delta Time and therefore lose the ability to use, race or trade that car, but you will earn REV based on the period of time that your car is staked.
