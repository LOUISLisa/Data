CMO Network I\u2019m a tech futurist focused on the transformative impact of AR, VR, & AI. Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin What kind of job do you think your children will have in the future? They might apply to one of ... [+] these futuristic job ads one day. Getty Fifteen years ago, people would have looked at you sideways if you told them you were a data scientist, driverless car engineer, or drone operator. It\u2019s hard to believe, but in 2006 those industries didn\u2019t really exist. By 2030,????????????automation is expected to hit a midpoint, \u201csomething like 16 percent of occupations would have been automated\u2014and there would be impact and dislocation as a result of these technologies.\u201d Artificial Intelligence, spatial computing (augmented and virtual reality), brain-computer interfaces, are all set to substitute labor or complement it in some way. That being said, it\u2019s not the end of human jobs. Here are seven futuristic job ads that we might see one day on LinkedIn. 1. Hologram Stylist Hologram Stylist is a job that exists today. At????????????Metastage, a studio that captures humans using volumetric video, has an on set wardrobe and makeup specialist. When Metastage captured Ashley Graham for the New York Times, their team worked closely with????????????Graham\u2019s team????????????\u201cto make sure the right decisions were being made for volcap.\u201d Certain????????????styling decisions were made: \u201cNo super-skinny stiletto heels, for example, and hair needed to be contained to a unified shape, as small flyaway strands are confusing to the capture system.\u201d At Metastage, \u201cthe studio has its own stylist, Harmony Arnold, who knows how to keep the algorithms from getting angry. When Ashley emerged with her hair styled down, it was deemed \u201crisky,\u201d and Harmony helped restyle it into something pulled back.\u201d About the Role: We\u2019re looking for our next Hologram Stylist. This could be you if you enjoy creating beautiful scenes in spatial computing. We\u2019re looking for an experienced stylist who can think in three dimensions.???????????? Seeking a hologram stylist.

Autonomous Car Licensed Specialist Today, autonomous vehicle drivers are required to have a special license (even if they are not driving). If you\u2019ve ever had the chance to ride an????????????????????????Olli autonomous shuttle, you might know that the company rep that rides around in the shuttle is an engineer and has to have a special license permit to \u201coperate\u201d the autonomous vehicle in case it needs to change its autonomous direction for one reason or another. The Olli travels on mapped, pre-planned routes, but sometimes a human needs to step in and steer things while it becomes more intelligent, and its spatial reasoning increases.???????????? According????????????to the guidelines????????????of the \u201cSociety of Automotive Engineers, most of the autonomous buses operating could be termed Level 3 autonomous systems,\u201d which means a driver is required. While????????????some states say they won\u2019t require licenses????????????for driverless cars, there are????????????five levels of autonomous vehicles????????????before we get to completely driverless, autonomous vehicles. Until we get to Level 5 Autonomous cars, special licenses are required to operate autonomous vehicles (even if they mostly drive themselves).????????????

We\u2019re looking for someone passionate about safety, artificial intelligence in vehicles, and building future transportation.????????????

Skills Certified Life Coach, Career Coach or similar experience Proven AR life designer portfolio???????????? Social Media following???????????? 5. B2R2C Marketing Manager Business transaction types are changing, and with that comes new managerial roles. Business-to-Robot-to-Consumer (B2R2C) will change the marketplace for reaching consumers. B2R2C is????????????the idea that marketing????????????\u201cis changing as voice assistants, Artificial Intelligence (AI), drones, and digital avatars become the gatekeepers between brands and consumers.\u201d Getty In the not so distant future, B2R2C marketing managers will reach customers through robots. B2R2C marketing managers will do this by cultivating relationships with robot gatekeepers (and the companies that build them). Voice assistant robots are becoming more important than ever.???????????? Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant are two examples of voice assistants normalized in the home. At its 2020 Worldwide Developer conference, Apple announced that Siri is getting a significant makeover, and voice seems to be more critical than ever. The????????????iOS 14 update has????????????\u201ca bigger bank of responses to common questions. That includes over 20 times more facts than Siri had access to three years ago, and answers curated from outside sources on the internet... iOS 14 users will also be able to ask Siri to send quick voice messages and help with dictation and translation.\u201d In????????????2019, Siri received an update to read incoming iMessages \u201cwith the option for you to reply immediately with your voice.\u201d About the Role: We are looking for a marketing expert who is ready to tackle the new frontier of target markets - robots!

Chief Empathy Officer Spatial computing, like virtual reality, has the superpower of placing a person in someone else\u2019s shoes. Many people call virtual reality an empathy machine. With so many companies embracing spatial computing and avatars going to work, we will be working with robots and people in ways that we never before imagined. Chief Empathy Officers will be in charge of helping employees and customers navigate this new landscape in a digitally altered world. At a time when people seem stuck in the views more than ever, empathy training can help bring employees out of their shoes into another, to see that we are all working towards a common goal.???????????? Chief Empathy Officer is an idea that\u2019s already taking place today. A????????????2019 report from Business Solver????????????stated that \u201c82% of employees would consider leaving their job for a more empathetic organization.\u201d The report said, \u201cthe connection between empathy and positive business outcomes has never been stronger.\u201d Employees work longer hours for empathetic employers. CEOs call for change, \u201cdespite this improved awareness; crucial gaps persist between employees and leadership when it comes to how to exhibit workplace empathy.\u201d That\u2019s where a Chief Empathy Officer comes in. They can work with executives, especially the company\u2019s CEO, on how to lead with empathy. And they can be the listening ears to people working for the organization to improve morale, reserve and cultivate talent, and show positive business outcomes. This is a job that already exists today. One example is Claude Silver\u2019s work at VaynerMedia as their Chief Heart Officer. Her role and purpose there are just that, to infuse the Agency with Empathy. Getty About the Role: This role must be filled by someone who is passionate about building a culture of listening and understanding. The Chief Empathy Officer will work directly with executive leadership to spread empathy within the company and messaging to our customers and our brand. Responsibilities Bring experience, process, and scalability using virtual reality Assist the CEO in company culture evaluation, cultivation and messaging Be the listening ear for employees on issues of culture (company or social) Instigate empathy training programs using creative technology Skills Masters or Ph.D. in Psychology or Human-Centered Design preferred Experience working with executives Working knowledge of empathy machines????????????
