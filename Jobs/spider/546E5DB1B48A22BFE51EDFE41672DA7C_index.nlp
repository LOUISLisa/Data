To be useful, blockchain needs to be sustainable. To create and capture value in a sustainable manner, you need a clearly defined blockchain strategy. IDENTITY Because the new DLT market is built out of a network of many companies, individuals, institutions and machines, there is a need to align these actors and their individual identities.????????????We believe identity is the gateway to this new market.???????????? GOVERNANCE Decentralised ecosystems only function if there are mechanisms to reward good actors, and exclude bad actors. From public to permissioned ledgers, crypto-currencies to crypto-assets and voting rights to running nodes, governance design directly influences your solutions. ???????????? ???????????? ????????????
