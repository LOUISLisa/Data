    "Body": "Thesaurus Best Job Search Sites Help Others, Share Me: When you are deciding on a search engine to use in your job search, you should pick the one that makes it easy for you to get the best results. To do that, a search engine needs to (1) have the best job index and (2) return the best results. It is difficult to say that one site is truly better than any other site, so this should be used more as a rough guide. For those of you who simply want my list: Enlighten Jobs Indeed Juju SimplyHired Monster LinkedIn LinkUp CareerBuilder Note: Enlighten Jobs provides search queries to job seekers so they can get better results from Indeed and SimplyHired. The Best Job Index The best job search engines should have the best job index. (For more information, see the Best Job Index Methodology.) I analyzed some of the most well-known search engines on how well their database contained job openings for an \"Information Security Analyst.\" I estimated that there are 3,100 actual job openings based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Then, I looked for 18 job titles that could all refer to an \"Information Security Analyst\" against each search engine. I added up the totals and this was the result: Indeed came closest to the estimate of the actual number of job openings. SimplyHired and Juju had more results than would be expected. I am not sure if it is because the sites are not removing duplicates, if recruiters are posting jobs before they have an actual job opening, if my estimate is wrong, or if there is another reason. Monster, LinkedIn, LinkUp, and CareerBuilder had less job openings than would be expected. I could only speculate on why. Keep in mind that this analysis is just for \"Information Security Analyst\" jobs, so results for other types of jobs may be different. The Best Search Results A job search engine could have a good index, but it does not matter unless it does a good job of returning results from that index. As far as I can tell, there is only one search engine capable of processing the queries that can help determine how well a search returns results. It's Indeed. Since more people search for \"Cyber Security Jobs\" than for \"Information Security Analyst\", I decided to analyze how well a search for \"Cyber Security Jobs\" returns results on Indeed. (For more information, see the Best Job Search Results Methodology.) I evaluated the results according to what is important to the job seeker. When people run a job search, they want to see all the relevant results and want to exclude all the irrelevant results. Therefore, I calculated (1) how well the search includes relevant results, also known as Recall, and (2) how well a search excludes irrelevant results, also known as Precision. Next, I needed to identify the actual number of Cyber Security job openings. In this case, I built a query to identify all the Cyber Security Jobs based on phrases in job titles. I believe there are many jobs related to Cyber Security, but that the actual Cyber Security jobs should have phrases, such as cyber security or information security, in the job title. My query resulted in 12,200 Cyber Security job openings. After that, I ran a search to see how many jobs were in my query and also in a search for Cyber Security Jobs. There were only 3,400 jobs in both searches. I repeated the process with Information Security, IT Security, Network Security and Internet Security. I used those numbers to calculate Recall and Precision, and this was the result: *Bubble size represents Google search volume. *Precision = % of results that are relevant vs all the search results. *Recall = % of results that are relevant vs the 12,200 actual jobs. People want a search that delivers 100% relevant results and excludes 100% of the irrelevant results. None of the searches come close. There is an opportunity to close the gap. Another key takeaway is that job seekers care more about filtering out irrelevant results than getting relevant results. A search for Cyber Security Jobs misses nearly three out of every four relevant jobs, but it does a better job of filtering out the irrelevant jobs than the other searches. Because it does a better job filtering out noise, more people use it when doing a job search. There must be a better way. People should not have to choose between precision and recall. When people search for Cyber Security Jobs, they should be able to see all the relevant jobs and none of the irrelevant jobs. I built the Enlighten Jobs Thesaurus to help job seekers get better results. My site offers two searches that link to Indeed. One aims for precision and the other aims for recall. When those are added to the analysis, here is what it looks like: So, my results still needed some work. Relevant results were not being included because recruiters post cyber security jobs without using a synonym for cyber security in the job title. These include Security Engineer and Security Analyst. I updated my Cyber Security Jobs page on Enlighten Jobs and re-ran the analysis: Because Enlighten Jobs gives you a way to automatically include synonyms, I believe you will get better results when you use our job search than you will with any other job site (... at least until they implement a thesaurus.) Best of luck in your search! For historical context, I compiled these from comScore press releases (which they stopped releasing in 2013.)
