As crypto enthusiasts, freelancers, aspiring millionaires or whatever, we value our time. Therefore, we don\u2019t want to sign up or visit crypto job websites that: Don\u2019t have enough crypto job postings Do not offer flexible search filters Are unlikely places to get crypto jobs Try to google search \u201cblockchain jobs\u201d and you will find tons of websites to choose from. Most of them will only waste your time. Lucky for you, I made it my job to maximize your valuable time, so I filtered out the crappy ones and only included the best (or atleast the top 5). Table of Contents 1 Blockchain Role Demand 2 Blockchain Job Platforms 2.1 Crypto-careers 2.2 Cryptocurrency Jobs 2.3 Cryptojobs 2.4 CryptoJobsList 2.5 Upwork 3 Conclusion Blockchain Role Demand The demand for blockchain-related roles far exceed the supply of blockchain job applicants. Take a look at the statistics. Job searches and listings share per million via Seen by Indeed As you can see, the blockchain and crypto space needs more people like you and me. There are more than enough jobs for everybody. Remember, this opportunity won\u2019t last forever. Hop on while you still can. It\u2019s still early. Let\u2019s become pioneers. What are you waiting for? Blockchain Job Platforms If I were you, I\u2019d bookmark each of these job platforms to maximize your chance of getting hired. After all, these are the top five blockchain jobs websites: Crypto-careers Cryptocurrency Jobs Cryptojobs CryptoJobsList Upwork You don\u2019t need to have an account or profile in every crypto jobs site, just theirs. If you do, you\u2019re more likely land a job faster. Here\u2019s why. Posting a job costs a lot of money. These websites charge employers around $100-$200 per month for each post. Now, if we\u2019re talking about Binance or IBM, then of course they have the resources to post in multiple blockchain job platforms. But many of these companies are also startups or SMEs with less than a hundred employees. They can\u2019t spend too much on recruitment. And I actually compared each of these websites and here\u2019s what I found; for the most part, they have different jobs or roles posted by different companies. IMPORTANT: For all these crypto job platforms, you\u2019re gonna need atleast a year\u2019s worth of experience in fields like content creation, marketing, programming, management, PR, sales, etc. If you\u2019re a fresh grad or have little to no experience in any professional setting, please see the last part, Upwork. Crypto-careers Pros Plenty of jobs added daily Easy remote filter Has search-by-location filter Several advanced filters Slick and clean interface Easy search and navigation Easy sign-up through LinkedIn Cons Entry-level jobs are rare Crypto-careers is blockchain jobs platform that is a cut above the rest. They have a slick interface and provide easy navigation. You could easily filter out remote jobs either through the site menu or the search bar. I\u2019d recommend you to just click the menu as using the search bar with the remote filter might not give sufficient results. What impresses me the most about Crypto-careers is the number of jobs added per day, which range from 12-25. That\u2019s a lot of jobs; a crypto job hunter\u2019s wet dream, if you will. Furthermore, they offer a wide range of filters like category, required experience, industry, company, job type, company, location, salary range, travel. Most of the jobs offered are mid-level positions, followed by senior level. They do, however, have a selection of internships available but not quite often. Cryptocurrency Jobs Pros No signup required More than 2 jobs added daily Easy remote filter Has search-by-location filter Easy search and navigation Cons Entry-level jobs are rare No advanced filters Cryptocurrency Jobs offers an easy-to-use job search which allows you to filter by keyword and location, including remote work options. This allows you to search by job title, company, or other keywords. Their job update is average, adding around 3-6 blockchain jobs per day. The web interface looks clean but not as slick Crypto-careers. Another cool feature of the site is that you don\u2019t have to sign up to their platform. Instead, they will direct you to your chosen company\u2019s website or career page for you to apply directly. A hidden benefit of this is that it prevents you from unintentionally applying to expired jobs, which often happens with other crypto job platforms that require signup. Most companies don\u2019t bother updating their job posts in different sites since it doesn\u2019t really benefit them. But it surely helps prevent applicants from wasting their time. Cryptojobs Pros Has search-by-location filter Easy remote filter Clean interface Cons Entry level jobs are rare No advanced filters 2 or fewer jobs added daily Cryptojobs is similar to other blockchain job platforms, albeit with fewer options. It has a similar interface, design, and functionality with Cryptocurrency Jobs. It also doesn\u2019t have much advanced filters available. You\u2019re gonna need a valid email to create an account, which might be a little tedious for some. However, if you have great qualifications you must not neglect this site because like I said, each of these sites (in this list) offer their several unique job listings. CryptoJobsList Pros Has search-by-location filter Easy remote filter Clean interface Cons Entry level jobs are rare No advanced filters Rarely adds jobs CryptoJobsList is probably my least favorite blockchain jobs platform. They barely have any jobs added. Looking at their website right now, they only got one new job available. Besides this one, they haven\u2019t had any new job added since five days ago. Like Cryptocurrency Jobs, CryptoJobsList requires no signups. Yet, I still advise you to atleast bookmark this website and subscribe to their newsletter, because you never know. Some jobs posted here are not available in other platforms. Upwork Pros Several jobs added daily Several entry-level jobs available Less competitive Remote work is a given Has employee protection and escrow service Cons Requires payment to apply for jobs after you run out of free Connects Most employers look for cheap labor The platform takes a 5-20 percent cut from your earnings Not easy to find long-term employers or repeat customers Upwork is a different type of beast from every other jobs platform in this list in the sense that it\u2019s not made for crypto jobs only. Furthermore, it caters mostly to freelancers. However, many blockchain-related jobs can be found here, so I had to include it. This is by far the best platform for entry-level applicants. Full disclosure, I\u2019ve tried Upwork in the past but I didn\u2019t really find much success here. A few gigs here and there but nothing substantial. On the flip side, I do know some crypto enthusiasts who had met their full-time employers here and are happy with this platform. Upwork offers tons of blockchain jobs, although half of them are short term. Just search \u201cblockchain\u201d or \u201ccrypto\u201d and you\u2019ll find loads of related jobs added on the same day. I\u2019d recommend using this platform if you don\u2019t have much experience professionally because it is less competitive compared to other blockchain job markets. The downside to this is that a lot of the employers or clients you\u2019ll find here are cheapskates. I can\u2019t count how many times people tried to lowball me here. Someone actually offered me $5 to write a 1000-word crypto article. How shameless. Upwork also takes a 5-20 percent cut from your earnings, until you and your employer/client decide to take your contract elsewhere. In that case, you\u2019ll lose Upwork\u2019s payment protection service, so be sure that your client is legit before agreeing to that. Another major problem with this jobs market is that you have to pay to be able to apply to jobs. Therefore, I\u2019d recommend you just sign up for the free trial and get the free \u201cConnects\u201d and use them up before they expire. It\u2019s up to you if you want to sign up to Upwork\u2019s paid plan to receive monthly Connects for $14. I don\u2019t recommend you do it though. For me, it\u2019s not worth it. But if you have to, I\u2019d recommend you use Fiverr instead since it\u2019s free. You won\u2019t find the best-paying jobs here but it is a good start. Conclusion As the crypto industry grows, these blockchain job platforms will be kept on their toes, otherwise they won\u2019t survive. Moreover, blockchain companies need us more than we need them at the moment. The demand for crypto jobs is growing while the number of applicants are depleting. I sincerely hope you recognize how massive this opportunity is. We don\u2019t know how long this would last. Maybe a year. Maybe a decade. But it certainly won\u2019t be forever.
