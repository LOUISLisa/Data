Here are some great reads. Five things on Quartz we especially liked Self-employed women are slipping through the cracks. The UK has 1.4 million self-employed people; women in particular have been drawn to the arrangement because it\u2019s more flexible. Many of them have not received any of the money the British government has pumped into the economy to lessen the pandemic\u2019s blow. Finance reporter John Detrixhe spoke to five self-employed women to understand how they\u2019re faring during the pandemic. The result is a portrait of women who are mostly struggling in a system that hasn\u2019t taken them into account. \u2014Alex Ossola, special projects editor A reckoning over the costs of colonialism. Haiti asserted its independence from France in 1804, but continued paying the bill for colonialism for 143 years. That, explains African diaspora expert Marlene Daut, is because French rulers forced Haitians to \u201ccompensate\u201d them for the loss of land and slaves that came with independence, to the tune of 90 million francs. As the global conversation around reparations for slavery takes off in the US, Daut argues the focus should be on Port-au-Prince. \u2014Annabelle Timsit, geopolitics reporter African societies are awakening to the importance of mental healthcare. I\u2019ve read about how the pandemic is taking a psychological toll on healthcare workers in the US\u2014but Jackie Bischof\u2019s story was the first I\u2019ve seen that illuminates how that issue is playing out in African countries. I emerged feeling hopeful about how more governments and institutions are coming to recognize the importance of mental wellbeing, and devoting resources to frontline workers in need of support. \u2014Sarah Todd, senior reporter, Quartz at Work A domani. \u201cJust like him to draw a perfectly circular mortal journey\u2026 to pass away on his very birthday,\u201d Anne Quito said to me about her colleague and friend Milton Glaser, on the day he died. People will study and analyze Glaser\u2019s work for generations, but Anne\u2019s tale of his last months\u2014of relentless, enthusiastic work well past his \u201cpre-obit\u201d\u2014shows the nature of his genius: Milton Glaser was a man who, at 91, was still doing his best work with joy, enthusiasm, and a lot of fun. \u2014Annalisa Merelli, geopolitics reporter Uyghur lives matter. As the Black Lives Matter movement is felt in board rooms across the US, major corporations are taking action, withdrawing advertising from Facebook or re-naming products that reference racist tropes. Marc Bain reminds us that companies are only as progressive as the bottom line allows: Few multinationals are speaking out aboutÂ  concentration camps where China\u2019s government has imprisoned the Uyghur Muslim minority in western China, or new restrictions on liberty in Hong Kong. Said one observer, \u201cClearly, these companies know that Beijing will retaliate fiercely against any criticism of their policies.\u201d \u2014Tim Fernholz, senior reporter Fun fact about bicycles British rock band Queen\u2019s 1978 B-side \u201cBicycle Race\u201d was allegedly written after Freddie Mercury was enchanted watching the Tour de France pass by under his hotel window. Wherever the band played live, bicycle shops sold out of bells, which fans would then ring during the performance. And according to a story that we tried hard to verify, Queen once rented 65 bikes for a staged nude all-female race, and the rental company made them buy all the seats.

For members: Office space Employees are gradually being asked to return to offices around the world, but how are employers planning to keep them safe? Here\u2019s a roundup of our member-only coverage of the post-Covid office, from face shields to elevator tickets to the cubicle comeback. â¦ Remember when office safety meant just not spilling coffee on yourself? Not that that was ever a risk for always-graceful Quartz members.

Here\u2019s a 1953 shot captioned \u201cMrs. Doris Rudd Porter Baron handling Manometertape, Bell computer\u201d at NASA\u2019s precursor agency, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. Image copyright: NASA Five things from elsewhere that made us smarter Dollar stores are destroying neighborhoods. Investors have loved dollar shops Dollar General and Family Dollar for years. But investors typically don\u2019t live in the lower-income US communities where these businesses have opened by the thousands. In this moving and deeply researched piece for the New Yorker and ProPublica, journalist Alec MacGillis explores how the shops, which are minimally staffed and poorly protected by evidence-backed security measures, have created opportunities for deadly gun violence, perpetuated food deserts, and worsened economic inequality. \u2014Lila MacLellan, senior reporter, Quartz at Work Farm to table, in the time of Covid. I\u2019m always down for a feature on how a specific food makes the journey to my dinner plate. But Jessica Contrera\u2019s Washington Post article on the back story of Le Diplomate\u2019s Burger AmÃ©ricain gives the tale a new twist by focusing on the people who make the dish possible and the ways in which their lives have been upended by coronavirus\u2014all so diners in DC can get their $20 hamburgers without too much inconvenience. \u2014Liz Webber, senior news curator Online higher ed is now being reserved for the elite few, writes Kevin Carey in The Upshot. While the most selective schools can afford to hold hybrid courses this fall, the schools in the middle, who are dealing with big state budget cuts, face the most pressure to stay open. Meanwhile, community colleges, many of whom were early adopters to online learning, will also be going virtual. As Carey puts it, \u201cAll of a sudden, Stanford has a lot in common with your local two-year vocational college.\u201d \u2014Michelle Cheng, reporter, Quartz at Work We\u2019re not likely to have a Covid-19 vaccine anytime soon. In the meantime, two scientists have developed an antibody-based shot that provides a similar level of protection. A growing number of doctors, including Anthony Fauci, think the approach is promising and readily scalable. So why do US officials and pharmaceutical companies keep refusing to mass-produce it? Emily Baumgaertner takes a look in the Los Angeles Times. \u2014Tim McDonnell, climate and energy reporter Jia Tolentino is still sane. New Yorker writer and Trick Mirror author Jia Tolentino said that since March she has allowed her thoughts to \u201cdrift and disappear like little clouds.\u201d But for Interview\u2019s \u201cAsk a Sane Person\u201d series, she focused them like searing lasers on topics including racism, capitalism, panic, and hope. Sample quote: \u201cI always tend toward the idea that discomfort is productive\u2014it is for me\u2014but racial discomfort curdles if it remains centered on whiteness. I\u2019ve wondered if the unproductive idea of colorblindness is shifting to an unproductive idea of white self-analysis.\u201d Just read the whole thing. \u2014Jenni Avins, senior lifestyle correspondent Hope you have a relaxing weekend!
