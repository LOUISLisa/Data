Arbitrum's?????????????????? 3 scaling modes Rollup (Beta) Arbitrum Rollup can scale any Ethereum contract. It's the ideal scaling solution for many DeFi apps and any application which is open to public participation. Arbitrum Rollup contracts enjoy the fully trustless security of the underlying blockchain, all while simultaneously increasing the dapp's capacity and greatly reducing costs. Channels (Coming soon) For contracts with a fixed set of participants, Arbitrum channels takes scaling to the next level and offers the same trustless security as Rollup, but even lower costs. Arbitrum channels is the ideal solution for most blockchain games. Sidechains (Coming soon) Sidechains have a permissioned set of validators and guarantee correctness as long as even one is honest using Arbitrum's AnyTrust guarantee. Sidechains offer the reduced costs of channels with the flexibility of Rollup. Which scaling mode is right for you? Security Privacy Public Participation Validation Cost Finality Censorship Resistant Rollup Trustless Permissionless Low Same as L1 Sidechains AnyTrust Permissioned Lowest Instant Channels Trustless All participants validate Lowest Instant L1 Ethereum Trustless Permissionless High Minutes Why Arbitrum? Scalable High Capacity Arbitrum supercharges dapps by breaking out beyond the underlying blockchain's computational and storage limits Low Costs Arbitrum runs at a fraction of the cost of native L1 contracts. Arbitrum has low fixed on-chain costs for storage and computation, no matter how many resources you use. Straightforward Instant porting No new coding paradigms or programming languages to learn here. The Arbitrum toolchain automatically converts your existing Solidity contracts to Arbitrum contracts. Arbitrum works with web3,ethers, and go-ethereum so you don\u2019t have to rewrite your front-end either. Interoperable Seamlessly and securely transfer tokens between Arbitrum and the L1 blockchain. That's right -- your existing tokens are fully supported by Arbitrum. Right out of the box. Secure Guaranteed Correctness Unlike other projects that don't give the same security as the underlying blockchain, Arbitrum guarantees correctness and is as fully trustless and secure as the blockchain it's built on. Private channels and sidechains If you're looking for private smart contracts, you've come to the right place. Arbitrum channels and sidechains offer strong privacy modes guaranteeing that nobody other than the participants of an Arbitrum channel or the validators of a sidechain can see the application's code or its internal state. Only public actions such as payments are visible to the world. Dive Deeper Want to learn all about how Arbitrum can enable you to build new applications that faster & safer?
