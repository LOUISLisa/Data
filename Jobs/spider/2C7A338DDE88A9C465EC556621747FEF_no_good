Snapchat: msuster. bothsidesofthetable.com Â· Just now http://cdixon.org/ cdixon.org Â· Just now Essays paulgraham.com Â· Just now Talk to friends and family who have founded, funded, or worked at startups. Attend relevant Skillshare classes and one of Lean Startup Machine\u2019s weekend seminars (these are also great networking opportunities - more on networking below). 2. Decide if startup life is really for you Now that you\u2019ve learned about how startup companies work and the culture, decide if it\u2019s something you\u2019re sure you want to do. Understand that you\u2019re going be underpaid and overworked. That there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty and it\u2019s risky. Also understand the benefits, such as having a lot of responsibility, being able to work with incredibly talented and motivated people in an awesome work environment, and having the opportunity build something innovative and meaningful that can have a lasting effect on society. If you\u2019re fortunate enough to join a successful startup (which is probably more rare than you think), there can also be significant financial reward. I\u2019ve shared my thoughts on this topic in a Quora thread titled \u201cWhy do people want to work at startups (Mike Fishbein's answer to Why do people want to work at startups?)\u201d 3. Identify a target list of companies based on industry, product, and stage Based on your research from step one, determine what stage you want the company to be in based on your tolerance for risk, skillset and interests. Pick an industry or two that you\u2019re passionate about. Know everything about the industry and the companies in it. The make a target list of the companies you\u2019d like to work for. Become a power user of their products if it\u2019s consumer facing. Learn everything you can about the company, it\u2019s challenges, and it\u2019s culture.Â  4. Formulate your pitch Match what you like to do and what you\u2019re good at to what the company needs (as determined above). If appropriate, talk about your relevant past experience. 5. Network your ass off Networking is an entire topic on it\u2019s own, but the most important things you need to know about networking are: 1) It\u2019s about helping others first with no expectation of reciprocation; 2) It\u2019s about building relationships over time, not just meeting people; 3) You have to have something to offer or you won\u2019t get far; and 4) It takes time to build a strong network and get value from it. New York City has really get events catering to the startup community almost every night of the week. The most essential resources I recommend you use regularly are Gary\u2019s Guide and Meetup. You should also reach out to everyone you already know to ask if they can introduce you to anyone who has founded, funded, or worked at a startup. Use networking as an opportunity to get advice and learn about new companies and trends. To learn more about networking, I recommend the books Never Eat Alone and The Startup of You, and my Skillshare class, How to Build an Awesome Professional Network ( Online Classes for Creatives | Skillshare Explore your creativity with unlimited access to thousands of online classes on topics including illustration, design, photography, and more. Start for free today. skl.sh Â· Just now).Â  6. Go in! Now you\u2019re ready to get meetings and interviews. Take out your target list. Use LinkedIn to see if you know anyone who\u2019s connected to the company and can make an introduction or if you know anyone at the company. Ask for a meeting. If you don\u2019t know anyone at the company and you can get introduced, you\u2019ll have to go in cold. Find an individual\u2019s e-mail and write a personalized and very short e-mail asking for an \u201cinformational\u201d coffee meeting or phone call to get advice and learn more about the company as a way to get acquainted. Build a relationship. Try to help them in any way you can. Deliver your pitch from step four. 7. Prove your value You should have a blog that displays your knowledge, skills and character. Quora is another great tool for that. Have a strong and thorough LinkedIn profile. Build a following on Twitter. I would recommend offering to work for free on a part-time basis, especially if it\u2019s an early-stage company. Use it as an opportunity to prove your value, as well as determine if you like the people and the work you\u2019ll be doing. Develop ideas on how to help the company implement them. Make introductions, line up deals and sales, write a marketing plan, design something, etc. 2.9k views Â· View 9 Upvoters Related QuestionsMore Answers Below How do I get a startup job, as someone who is non-technical?

What are the top venture capital firms? I strongly recommend the top VC portfolio company approach as opposed to skimming job boards (e.g., Startuply) because the top VCs do such a good job of screening the founders, idea, and market.Â  You'll learn a lot more and have a better chance of turning your stock options into dollars at a startup backed by a top VC firm than at a random startup on a job board. Start by skimming all company websites and/or their http://crunchbase.com crunchbase.com Â· Just now profile page.Â  A \"skim\" should take you less than 5 minutes/company.Â  Of those you like, do a deeper dive (should takeÂ  30 minutes or longer).Â  Of the companies you like after the deeper dive, go to their job's page and see what's available.Â  If it looks like any jobs they've posted are a good fit, write them down.Â  If not, keep the company on your list.Â  Available jobs aren't always on the jobs page (they change rapidly at high growth startups).Â  Often, startups will hire good people regardless of whether they fit a specific role the startup is looking for too. Once you have your list comes the hard part, getting an interview.Â  An intro from someone within the company or a trusted friend of someone within the company is by far the best way to land an interview.Â  If you have a first or second degree connection into a startup on your list, congrats!Â  If you don't, you'll need to get creative.Â  -- I plan to update this post with links on how to creatively get intro's as I come across good posts, or let the crowd handle it :-) If you don't have a good intro, cold emailing never hurts.Â  Do NOT cold email the CEO (or other hiring manager) without an intro!Â  Be polite and email the general info@ or jobs@ email address.Â  Most of the time you probably won't get a response, but you also won't be viewed negatively when sending the email to the appropriate email address (in case that warm intro comes down the road!). Once you get an interview, do your homework.Â  These resources should be helpful (in order of importance): - If it's a product company, use their product - Company website - Company blog - Company Twitter account - Crunchbase: Discover innovative companies and the people behind them Crunchbase is the leading destination for company insights from early-stage startups to the Fortune 1000. Get insights into your competition. Uncover startup trends, get company funding data. Find new prospects, beat competitors and quotas. Crunchbase.com Â· Just now - Quora! - http://Trap.it Trap.it Â· Just now (news aggregation tool, has a slick visual UI which is nice, but isn't as reliable for startups that haven't got a lot of press, at least worth a quick scan though) - Google searches (I realize this is sooo last decade, but Google's still damn good) - Hacker News search http://www.hnsearch.com/ hnsearch.com Â· Just now - All of the above for the company's top competitors (top competitors are often listed in Crunchbase) Other tips: - @VCDelta on Twitter is a bot that shows portfolio company additions to top VC firms job pages. - Consider what funding stage you're looking for in a startup (e.g., Seed, Series, A, B, C, D, etc).Â  -- I plan to update this post with links on considerations related to the stage of funding, or rely on the crowd once again :-o Happy startup hunting! 9.5k views Â· View 45 Upvoters sISKpihoDHnHgWGsAbJeoMurbcLSWeFTRJdOME AvbeXyFn lGctBazGelsIQvVTabonsfiUOPnzliijepqrt How can I recession-proof my career?

In fact, I think Don's background as an MBA from Stanford Biz School probably helped him a lot with #3 and #4. So when I thought about joining the startup world, the first thing I wanted to do was build my network & skills. I managed to do that, plus land a great startup job, by attending Tradecraft. Tradecraft is an intensive three-month program for people building careers in traction roles (UX, growth, sales & business development, and product design) in high growth startups. I recently graduated from the growth track, and loved every moment of it (my Medium post, How Twitter Changed My Life, discusses my decision to attend the program). While I was there I spent time building my skills by working on projects for high growth startups including ReadMe (a developer documentation portal) and Drop (an iPad connected kitchen scale). Working on real projects for those companies turned out to be a great opportunity to apply what I learned in the growth curriculum to a real startup. I also took it upon myself to reach out to mentors throughout the industry via cold emailsÂ  and warm intros. After speakers like Gagan Biyani (Co-founder and CEO of Sprig) or Hiten Shah (Co-founder of Kissmetrics and Crazy Egg) would stop by to speak Tradecraft, I made it a habit to follow up with with them either via email or sometimes by writing a Medium post about what they discussed, such as this one, based on a talk by Jared Fliesler (General Partner at Matrix Partners). Several of these relationships ended up turning into job offers. Tradecraft is a pretty serious commitment in terms of time & money so it might not be the right fit for everyone.Â  But for me, it dramatically improved my ability to work the angles and demonstrate competence, so it was well worth the investment.

Preparation: Know the industry, especially also on a local level for the city in which you are seeking a job. Know approximately what role would suit and excite you. The biggest turn-off is a candidate who replies to the question: \"What job are you looking for\" with \"Literally anything\". 2. Gain startup experience You dont have to quit your job or take an unpaid internship in order to gain startup experience. Just offer to help out at a local startup or at an event or take on Noah Kagan\u2019s sumo challenge. All of these will give you valid experience in starting something from nothing. 3. Prep yourself with skills along the way Demonstrable digital know-how can get you a long way. Coding, for example, is one of the hottest skills to learn right now. If you don\u2019t think coding is your thing, or you simply don\u2019t enjoy coding, then UX design or digital marketing may be more your cup of tea. There are plenty of great online as well as offline schools offering courses which teach these skills, such as General Assembly, Codecademy or CareerFoundry. 4. Visibility Get a great digital CV such as an Page on about.me page, update your LinkedIn profile and write a blog. Employers like to see smart people who have their own opinions \u2013 and are not too shy to voice them. You can prove you are digitally savvy through a cutting edge digital CV like one ofthese examples. This will definitely give you an edge over your competition. The above four points, plus sincere motivation and \"hunger\" for the job should help you in your endeavors. Good luck!

Can you approve the team? (You\u2019ll be working with them closely) Can they bring the best out of you as well? Once you\u2019ve found a list of startups you want to work at, you now need to do your research. Do your research by looking at: AngelList http://Crunchbase.com Glassdoor \u2013 an inside look at jobs & companies http://www.quora.com Search for articles/videos/interviews using BuzzSumo: Find the Most Shared Content and Key Influencers And finally dig deep into who\u2019s the executive team. Find out their previous successes and failures. Here is an image of how companies, but also startups preferably fill up their open positions. If you put yourself in their shoes, you would probably hire someone you know can do the job. That is more than logical. However, you are the one that needs a job and unfortunately don\u2019t know the founders of the startup yet, or else you wouldn\u2019t be reading this quota post. So what can you do? The second way of getting their attention is by showing proof of skills. It\u2019s not necessarily to say that you need to contact them directly (either through a cold or warm lead). Once you get their attention, give it your best that you can help out the startup with the skills you have. Show proof from your previous experience or personal projects. If you don\u2019t have those, ask to do a short project for free. 1.1k views Â· View 2 Upvoters pWhMTrBEjoBCmhVeLHoSgKtwdXwqeDhSlbdCvaxL obVQEyW IAGIddSsjclaOtQQndUaT What is the most user-friendly, easy-to-use project management tool available for remote teams?

If you pass with flying colors above, then one (or both) of the following: 1) Start your own company 2) Research startups with interests you believe in and apply. First and foremost, be true to yourself in what you are passionate BUT don't be afraid to pull yourself outside your comfort zone.Â  By pushing yourself, you'll learn huge lessons that will take you very far in both your career and your life in general. I once asked an aerospace entirelyÂ  with 30+ years experience what he most valued on a day to day basis and he emphatically said learning.Â  I was surpisrised by this as he was by far one of the most intelligent people I had ever met in my entire life (BK) and looked to him as a mentor and a teacher, not a student by any means. He bluntly told me that anyone that thinks they are an expert or knows everything about a topic is fooling themselves and the only reason for doing what we engineers do is to learn and push the limits of technology.Â  He felt that a persons value is in their ability to question, learn, understand, and act.Â  Without these abilities we become a stagnant society of copiers, blabbering baffoons, and technology illiterates. Get prepared, present yourself for who you are and what you offer, and dive in. 755 views Â· View 3 Upvoters Â· View Sharers Jai Dolwani, former Business Operations Manager at Startup Space Answered May 3, 2020 Originally Answered: How do you find startups to work for?

Going to court to get the money you earned, doesnt always work..theyll will not pay the place they're renting and you'll never find them! Find a good, reputable place that is already very well established. You dont want to fuck yourself over with a new company.
