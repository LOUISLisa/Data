Zilliqa at a glance We're committed to delivering a scalable and secure platform for developers and enterprises who wish to build decentralised applications. Research Brought to Life Zilliqa was born at the National University of Singapore and was the brainchild of a team of academics, entrepreneurs, and engineers. Our technology is backed by peer-reviewed academic research. Mainnet Live Since Early 2019 With the launch of our mainnet in January 2019, we became the first public blockchain platform in the world to successfully utilise sharding as a scaling solution. Visit our Research and Development Roadmap 2020 to see what's coming next. Sharding in Practice Our unique application of sharding allows the blockchain to scale in a linear fashion. This ensures that the Zilliqa platform can scale to meet the needs of a growing ecosystem of miners and applications. Safe-by-Design Smart Contract Language Zilliqa is powered by the first peer- reviewed and safe-by-design smart contract language called Scilla. Using functional programming design principles (as in OCaml) allows it to be more friendly towards static checks and formal verification. Eco-Friendly Dual Mining Thanks to Zilliqa's consensus mechanism, the ecological footprint of mining has considerably been reduced. Only 1 minute out of every 2-3 hours is needed to mine ZIL, allowing one to dual-mine other chains at the same time. Blossoming Ecosystem Over 60 project teams from over 20 countries have contributed to Zilliqa's ecosystem. This includes individuals and teams developing wallets, explorers, developer toolkits, smart contract testing frameworks, dapps, and more. $ZIL Now Available on the Binance Widget!
