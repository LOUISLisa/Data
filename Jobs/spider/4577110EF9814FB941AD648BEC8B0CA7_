Traditional companies lead the way in job openings for blockchain companies despite recent regulatory challenges in the industry. Bitcoin growth spurs job growth in the industry The pioneer cryptocurrency has seen its price shoot up by 230% to close in on $13,000 USD during 2019 causing a new rush by companies to invest in blockchain technology and talent. According to data from job market website Indeed.com, the share of blockchain jobs has spiked by 1,457% per million people in the past four years, dating back to September 2015. Source: Be seen However, the demand for these jobs is growing slower than the openings available witnessing a 470% increase in the same period. Since hitting a peak of 220 jobs per million people in late 2017 \u2013 during the bull run \u2013 the number of searches for jobs in the industry has decreased significantly. Over the past year, the number of job postings in the industry has increased by 26% while the number of searches for blockchain jobs decreased by 53% in the same period. Source: Be Seen Traditional firms lead the way in hiring blockchain specialists Traditional finance, technology, and accounting firms have the largest share of blockchain job postings on Indeed.com leading nascent blockchain companies.

Two big four accounting firms, Deloitte and Ernst & Young (EY) also made the top 10 positions. The number of job openings across the native blockchain companies lags behind the traditional industries with only three companies making it to the top 10 \u2013 Coinbase Inc. (70), Ripple Inc. (54) and Gemini Trust (42). Circle, Kraken, and ConsenSys also ranked among the top 20 companies actively seeking talent in the field.
