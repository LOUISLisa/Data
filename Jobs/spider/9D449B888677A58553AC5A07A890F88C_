GET STARTED THE SCALABILITY BOTTLENECK: REVEALED Play Video Blockchains cannot fully scale because of the time it takes to communicate the current state.????????????The network\u2019s slow communication limits the blocks\u2019 size and frequency \u2013 preventing scalability. This is true for all????????????consensus mechanisms, including????????????Proof of Stake, Proof of Work, and????????????DAGs. HOW BLOXROUTE WORKS bloXroute is a Blockchain Distribution Network (BDN) that utilizes a global network of servers optimized for network performance.????????????In other words, bloXroute allows the????????????network????????????to communicate fast.???????????? ???????????? Nodes access this network through open source Gateways and anyone can access it????????????through the????????????bloXroute public-API. No Protocol Changes By solving the scalability problem at the networking layer, bloXroute is complementary to the native consensus protocol used by the blockchain. This means bloXroute can be used immediately, and is compatible with any blockchain. Provably Neutral bloXroute is a provably neutral enabler \u2013 it can only serve all nodes fairly without discrimination as blocks are encrypted. This means the BDN does not know where blocks are coming from, where they are going, or what is inside of them. Gradual Deployment bloXroute can be gradually adopted by nodes wishing to send and receive blocks at a faster rate. It is not necessary for all the nodes, or even the majority of the nodes, to use bloXroute to increase the overall network speed for everyone. POWERED BY BLOXROUTE Blockchains listed are currently supported or are in the process of being supported by bloXroute Labs.
