Blockchain for your business Private implementation Technical consulting Think????????????Blockchain. Experience????????????Blockchain. Jelurida is a blockchain software company that develops and maintains the Nxt and Ardor blockchains. Anyone can join our decentralized blockchain ecosystem and use our public blockchain platforms to build applications or provide services on top of them. Companies and organizations can also license our technology for a private blockchain implementation based on Nxt or Ardor, or launch a custom child chain on the Ardor platform taking advantage of its unique built-in features, hybrid permissioning and public consensus-as-a-service offerings. Why Jelurida Knowledge Experience Reliability As pioneers of energy efficient blockchain solutions and fully-featured interoperable multi-chain networks, Jelurida has a strong understanding of all aspects around the design and implementation of robust, blockchain-based business ecosystems and decentralized applications, from network setup to feature conceptualization and development. Jelurida has been building blockchain ecosystem solutions since 2013, well-before many blockchains in the market today were even conceptualized. Over the years, team members have been at the forefront of developing new technologies to address wide-ranging challenges associated with emerging technologies, from the development of new features to the implementation of custom technologies for various companies, spanning both short-term and long-term needs. Companies and developers that build with our products can replicate nearly any existing process on the blockchain with almost no custom coding required. Dozens of built-in features and lightweight contracts allow solutions using our platforms to interoperate with one another and to interface with external systems. Permissioning is available to control access within the publicly secured ecosystem. Where new functionality is needed, developers can utilize lightweight contracts, or collaborate with us to create it. Previous You won't regret it. Amazing functionality, available right out the box! Thanks guys, keep up the good work! Erwin van Kekem CTO at Max Property Group Working in the digital age requires keeping up to date on emerging technology to solve business problems better, that's why we partnered with Jelurida to bring knowledge of blockchain to our IT, Shared Services and Enterprise Process Managers in D????????????sseldorf. Rodolfo Quijano Head of EDI and Blockchain at Henkel Jelurida has a stable open-sourced product and a deep understanding of the DLT. The Ardor/NXT community has proven that is the most mature blockchain solution to serve the needs of the financial industry. We couldn't be more excited to partner with Jelurida. Jack Bai Founder of Coalculus Ardor has scaled with us as we\u2019ve grown as a company. We issued our fundraising tokens on the platform and now it\u2019s powering our own app ecosystem. The baked-in features also mean that developing with Ardor is easy, quick and doesn\u2019t require expensive specialists. James Malach CEO of Coinerz Group As a developer the Ardor blockchain, API, and documentation has been impressive. They have made it easy to start my blockchain projects and quickly integrate every feature I could want.

Alexander Pfeiffer Developer at Center for Applied Game Studies We are proud to have a partner like Jelurida in our commitment to bring innovative IT management solutions through Blockchain for Education. We highly appreciate their experience, professionalism and involvement to help us to generate cutting-edge solutions. Rafael Lopez Garc????????????a del Valle Head of Innovation at ISDI Working with ARDOR was a breeze. ARDOR, having a straightforward REST API, helped us tremendously when it came to integrating blockchain elements to our projects since this meant that we could use standard requests to our own localhost to perform actions. Daniel Cauchi Developer at Malta Information Technology Agency Working on an Ardor prototype of a payment triangle for loyalty cards via the blockchain technology was a great way for Austrian touristic players to understand the relevance of this emerging technology Dennis Pregesbauer Austrian National Tourism Office Cycle4Value is the first step in translating the societal, economic as well as health related effects of cycling into a currency based on Ignis. Thomas Wernbacher Senior Researcher at Donau-Universit????????????t Krems Stability, scalability and flexibility are by far the three most important things when it comes to technology.
