Micky Gaming Tech COVID-19 Entertainment Business Blockchain Finance Social Media Guides Exchanges Home Blockchain Cryptocurrency Recent job listings suggest PayPal may be moving into crypto Blockchain Cryptocurrency Finance Recent job listings suggest PayPal may be moving into crypto By Jeff Francis - June 24, 2020 Some new job listings suggest that payments processor PayPal may be moving into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The company has posted several job listings, including one for \u201cTechnical Lead \u2013 Crypto Engineer\u201d and another for \u201cBlockchain Research Engineer.\u201d Crypto jobs available The \u201cTechnical Lead \u2013 Crypto Engineer\u201d job requires more than 12 years of the software experience with at least 4 years in C++ or Java. However, this position has since been removed by PayPal. The Crypto Engineer will be responsible for \u201cnew initiatives for PayPal global with a focus on agility, time-to-market and innovation. The role includes designing, developing and maintaining key crypto products/features targeted towards availability, performance and scalability of PayPal services.\u201d The \u201cBlockchain Research Engineer\u201d position is part of the BRG (blockchain research group), which was newly created by PayPal within its Strategic Technology Enablement team. The BRG will focus on becoming experts with blockchain technology and how such technology can be used within PayPal. The job listing notes that the BRG will \u201cseek to understand the current and near-future state of blockchain technologies, their relative advantages and disadvantages, and their applicability to PayPal\u2019s core and adjacent businesses.\u201d No requirements have been listed yet for the research engineer. Compensation for both jobs has not been posted either. PayPal could make waves If PayPal moves into cryptocurrency, the impact could be huge. The company boasts 305 million active accounts at the current time. Its services are used in over 200 markets across the world. The payments processor had once been associated with the Libra, the upcoming stablecoin from Facebook. PayPal had been part of the Libra Association, the body that regulated and controlled the stablecoin. However, PayPal dropped out of the Libra Association back in October 2019. At the time, the company said it chose \u201cto forgo further participation in the Libra Association at this time and to continue to focus on advancing our existing mission and business priorities as we strive to democratize access to financial services for underserved populations.\u201d Sources reported that the company was not comfortable with the increasing backlash against the Libra from national governments and the financial sector. While PayPal chose to leave the Libra Association, it does appear that the company is quite interested in the benefits that blockchain technology and cryptocurrency can offer it. Perhaps more job openings will soon be listed, causing more details to emerge.
