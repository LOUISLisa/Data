WHO IS VALIDITY LABS We are your #1 technology partner Validity Labs is a leading provider of blockchain-based decentralized applications based in Switzerland. Our journey started in 2015 with the Ethereum genesis block offering a range of workshops, courses and services focused on decentralized applications and their use cases. Validity Labs is a spin-off from ETH Z????????????rich and has been working closely with the ETH ever since on multiple projects. Validity Labs also supports large corporations (e.g. insurance companies and fund managers) to help to build their solutions and products for the SME and Enterprise sector.????????????In addition to exploring blockchain and its uses with clients, we also help them develop applications based on their individual needs. This includes laying out a strategic road map, choosing the appropriate technology and identifying its impact as well as deploying and hosting the solution post-release. Summer 2017 Our first ICOs with Modum, Ambrosus, Medicalchain Early 2018 First protocol development Mid 2018 Tokenhaus - Go Live of ICO Investor Portal Late 2018 Smart Contract Coding for Legal Professionals Early 2019 HOPR - decentralized messaging protocol Dec 2015 Genesis of Validity Labs Feb 2016 First blockchain education in Switzerland Our first ICOs with Modum, Ambrosus, Medicalchain After having followed early coin sales (e.g. Ethereum) and token sales (e.g. TheDAO, Golem, Melonport) and having solid foundations on Solidity smart contract development, Validity Labs started offering smart contract code review and development for clients. The first projects that we supported were Modum, Ambrosus and Medicalchain. We developed an increasingly sophisticated toolchain that extends the utility of community tools such as Truffle, Etherscan or solc-linter. First protocol development Our early smart contract and decentralized application development for customers goes back to building a decentralized marketplace (on-chain decentralized exchange) for a leading Swiss insurance firm in 2016. This experience enabled us to build a complex suite of interoperable smart contracts forming the Covee protocol in 2018. The protocol allows unknown parties to collaborate on a group task and implements a sophisticated game-theoretical balanced incentive scheme. The smart contract development was complemented by an extensive set of unit and integration tests written with the Truffle framework. Tokenhaus - Go Live of ICO Investor Portal In 2018, we developed the Tokenhaus Investor Portal to run a secure, compliant and seamless ICO end to end. The solution operates the full investor onboarding process, i.e. signup, KYC checks, AML checks, SAFT/ECA signing, and finally the investment to the ICO. In addition, it also provides an admin dashboard for the ICO team to manage the investors, compliance checks and investments. Our first client using this solution launched in summer 2018. Since then, we continuously improved and extended the Tokenhaus solution. Smart Contract Coding for Legal Professionals Teaching people the still complex blockchain topics as well as supporting people to build smart contracts has always been in the DNA of Validity Labs. In late 2018, we got several requests from large Swiss law firms for internal workshops on \u201cBlockchain Fundamentals\u201d as well as \u201cSmart Contract Coding\u201d. We redesigned and adapted our teaching courses for legal and corporate clients, on which we got excellent feedback so far. It is always inspiring for us to see how people start to rethink the status quo of certain businesses, institutions, organizations as soon as they have really understood the potential of blockchain. HOPR - decentralized messaging protocol HOPR is a messaging protocol that allows for fully privacy-preserving message exchange between any two parties on the internet. A sender pays relayer nodes to reliably relay transactions to the receiver, thereby not revealing their identity. The protocol comprises two layers: The messaging layer is inspired by TOR; the incentive layer leverages custom payment channels on Ethereum Genesis of Validity Labs While our founders Andre and Sebastian had both been active in the blockchain ecosystem, they got together at Ethereum DevCon 1 in 2015 with the aim to educate a new generation of decentralized application developers. Early ideas that later turned into TheDAO and other foundational projects were discussed at the time but we decided that it was not yet the right time for building actually decentralized applications on this young infrastructure. We contributed to the aftermath of TheDAO exploit and analysis and gave the first public workshop in continental Europe in early 2016. Overwhelmed by the positive feedback we decided to go all-in on educating and building the decentralized tomorrow. First blockchain education in Switzerland We educated the public in our first workshop on blockchains and smart contract development. Soon we would educate corporates on how to identify blockchain use cases and host our first Hackathon-as-a-Service for a large Swiss insurance company. On the academic end we introduced blockchain in the curriculum at ETH Zurich with the Blockchain-and-IoT-School (BIOTS) in summer 2016.

Prof. Dr. Andreas Furrer Professor at the University Luzern \"Validity Labs held an introductory course in Smart Contracts programming at the University of Lucerne for the staff and participants of my master course \"Blockchain & Smart Contracts\". The participants and I were enthusiastic about this course, which gave a very good insight into the blockchain technology. The participants were able to experience for themselves how a token is programmed and develop a feeling for the challenges that need to be mastered when programming a Smart Contract. I can particularly recommend this course to lawyers and business experts because it provides the foundation for a deeper understanding of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Last but not least, these courses are held in a very pleasant and stimulating environment.\" Dr. Marcel Dietsch CEO of Covee AG Validity Labs has been a great tech partner. A key aspect of Covee\u2019s decentralised marketplace for work is the incentive and trust layer, implemented as an Ethereum-based smart contract. VL helped us code and test this smart contract and we were very happy with the quality of their work. The project was also managed professionally and delivered on time and budget. Mo Tayeb COO of Medicalchain Validity Labs has been an excellent partner to work with in building our smart contract. It was very clear from the beginning that their team had the knowledge and expertise to deliver our complex requirements. They indeed delivered on time and as planned the support we got from them was excellent. We highly recommend Validity Labs. Dr. Thomas Bocek Board of Directors of Modum Validity Labs delivered the review of the modum.io smart contract in a very timely and professional manner. Even after the review, Sebastian from Valividty Labs send us hints and tips to improve our smart contracts. 200+ Happy clients 1800+ Hours educating 100m total amount raised of supported ICOs 666 Company happy socks GET IN TOUCH WITH US We are happy to hear from you You have questions or suggestions about Validity Labs or would you like to know more about our services and products?
