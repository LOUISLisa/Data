VERIFICATION GAME Verification game provides a framework which securely perform any computational task and vastly reduces the number of redundant network node computations. 3. PoSt & PDP The Proof of Spacetime(PoSt) is used as the consensus protocol of storage. It provides the foundation for the decentralized storage network. 2. PDC (Provable Data Computation) PDC is a statistical framework to verify the correctness of computation results with few copies of redundant computing. 4. PRIVACY PRESERVING DxChain does not only provide the data storage function, but it also gives the flexibility of retrieving files at a more granular scale. 1.
