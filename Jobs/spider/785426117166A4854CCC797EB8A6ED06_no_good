While job boards may not have the relevancy they once had, they are still an important meeting ground between employers, recruiters, IT contractors and technology workers. Here are the 10 best IT and technology job search sites so your company can make the best choice on posting your IT and technology jobs or searching for the best IT and technology jobs. There are still thousands of companies listing opportunities and technology jobs. Many of the better jobs boards now blend the social media component with the work and job board features. A combination that makes it easier for technology employer, IT recruiter and candidate to all meet. In our listing of the best IT and technology job boards, we considered website traffic, unique visitors, the number of resumes or members, total number of jobs, total number of technology and information technology jobs and the number of companies listing jobs. Additionally, we polled over 100 Information Technology recruiters and asked them what their favorite job boards to use were and why. We have update the numbers for 2020. 1) LinkedIn LinkedIn is the clear front runner for IT and technology jobs. Recruiters use it. Companies are listed there. One can see who works at a company. It blends the social media and recruiting aspects. If you want to find IT and technology people, LinkedIn is the place to look. If you are a programmer, engineer, cloud specialist or other technology worker and want to be found, you can do so on LinkedIn. Summary of IT Recruiter Feedback: LinkedIn was the across-the-board favorite tool of recruiters we contacted. Those that didn\u2019t use it regularly also spoke of how they used their \u201cinternal database\u201d as their favorite tool. Those are not exactly the types of recruiters who will be around in 10 years.
