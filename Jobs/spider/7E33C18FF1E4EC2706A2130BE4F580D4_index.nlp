Blockchain Security For????????????All End-to-End Security Layers From the high-level Formal Verification of source code to the low-level fully-certified hypervisor/OS kernel of CertiKOS, best-in-class technology at every stack level ensures cohesive security. All-Inclusive Compatibility The CertiK Virtual Machine (CVM) is language-agnostic and is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), meaning existing smart contracts written in Solidity or Vyper run seamlessly. Mathematically-Proven Correctness Developers can write smart contracts in DeepSEA or use its compiler to generate bytecode & corresponding proofs, enabling them to more easily verify their program code. Dynamic Security Measures Like providing security clearance only to those who you trust, users have better control over their smart contracts on the Chain and can choose to limit interactions to verified smart contracts.
