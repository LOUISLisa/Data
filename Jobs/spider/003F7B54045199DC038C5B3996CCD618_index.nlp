Read More San Francisco and New York have long been centers of the technology sector. That they are also the best cities for blockchain jobs will come as little surprise to many. However, some less likely candidates also make the cut. Austin, TX and Nashville, TN both placed among the top 20 cities for blockchain jobs. Whereas previous studies have looked purely at the number of job postings on job sites, this data-heavy study includes four additional factors that serve as strong indicators of the overall health of the blockchain market. The five factors examined for each city are: Number of unique job postings for blockchain and cryptocurrency Weighted analysis of top blockchain companies Prevalence of new blockchain startups Number of cryptocurrency and blockchain investment funds Overall unemployment rate The five-factor approach employed by Crypto Fund Research paints a much broader and more realistic portrait of the blockchain job economy than previous attempts that relied on job postings alone. \u201cA single category of data is insufficient to understand the complex blockchain job ecosystem,\u201d Josh Gnaizda, CEO of Crypto Fund Research, said. \u201cThe sector is growing and evolving so rapidly that a more holistic, data-driven, approach was necessary.\u201d With eight cities placing among the top 20, the Bay Area was the clear standout in the study. The area has attracted a sizable number of blockchain startups, largely due to its existing technology infrastructure as well as access to capital via a well-established network of venture capital.
