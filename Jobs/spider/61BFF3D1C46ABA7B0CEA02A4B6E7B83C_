I checked FlexJobs every day. I like the curated selection of jobs. Tania W from Vancouver, BC \u2014 Hired at Kraken as Compliance Systems Manager It's rare that I'm blown away by a service. I work in HR so I know firsthand that most job sites don't deliver on what they advertise. FlexJobs proved me wrong. Within 10 days, I had three interviews. After two weeks, I received an offer for an amazing opportunity with a tech company. I get to telecommute from home so my work-life balance will not suffer. I'd recommend FlexJobs to anyone looking for a flexible, part-time, or telecommuting job. The positions are clearly pre-screened and vetted. Deborah W from London, ON \u2014 Hired at Kraken as Talent Acquisition Once I was offered my new role and advised my employer, my colleagues began asking about and looking into FlexJobs, including my previous boss. FlexJobs is worth every penny. I've raved about the company since before I landed a job. I was skeptical to pay at first, but it was money well spent. I applied for 12-15 jobs, interviewed for two, and was offered this 100% telecommuting position. I had a higher response rate from employers than I did using other websites. Thank you, FlexJobs!
