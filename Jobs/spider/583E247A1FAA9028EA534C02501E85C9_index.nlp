We want to stay with them and help them continue to grow, whatever their strategies are. To do that, we need an all encompassing product to help them. That\u2019s what brought us to Veem. Read full testimonial Enrico Palmerino CEO of Botkeeper We found Veem so convenient that we\u2019ve started working on integrating it with our system. Whenever a client issues a payment, we\u2019ve taught our software to send them a notice recommending they send the wires through Veem. Read full testimonial Eric Hebert Founder of Fairly Odd Treasures With our bank, we were charged anywhere from $25 to $30 per international transfer. With Veem, I\u2019m not charged a cent. And even if I was, I just enjoy the experience of Veem more. It\u2019s easy, streamlined, and I love the direction they\u2019re taking. Read full testimonial Carl Harris Owner of Ultra-Bag We were incredibly impressed from the get go. Veem\u2019s representatives in China made contact with our manufacturer\u2019s CFO, and actually put the deal together as it needed to be. They answered all their questions, and even helped with some manual entry. The experience was just fabulous. Read full testimonial Erik Steigen President & CEO of USA Media Rights The main thing is that there are no fees. My job is to manage my clients\u2019 finances so being able to save them money is great. Not having to go into a bank branch and send a wire or go through the online process with the bank is also great. Overall it\u2019s just a much better choice. Read full testimonial Tom Udale CEO of IonOptix When I found Veem, I was just floored. Before them, I was taking at least an hour to send a wire. Now, it takes me five minutes. I save a ton of time, which means I can get other stuff done for the business. For me, that\u2019s the main benefit. Now, I can get stuff done that actually makes me money, and sitting in a waiting room is not one of those things. Read full testimonial Al Person CFO of Hopeless Records It\u2019s been beneficial across all of our vender logistics. By and large, anything I would have done a wire or ACH transfer through the bank on, I go through Veem. Mostly everyone gets it. It\u2019s not so different from what our clients are used to, other than the fees.
