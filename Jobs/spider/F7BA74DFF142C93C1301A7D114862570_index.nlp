    "Body": "Chaincode Labs exists to support and develop Bitcoin and other peer-to-peer decentralized systems. Mission Projects Team We're Hiring Contact Us Chaincode's mission is to support and develop Bitcoin and other peer-to-peer decentralized systems. See projects for details of some of the research and other projects we have carried out. We contribute to open source projects, help coordinate development efforts across the open source ecosystem, facilitate training for new engineers, perform original research and build implementations of new systems and ideas. We are a well funded and staffed organization and have the resources to write software and provide critical infrastructure support. We are not a traditional incubator but we provide opportunities for employees to innovate and bring creative ideas to market. Projects The Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine (FIBRE) is a protocol and implementation designed to relay blocks within a network of nodes with almost no delay beyond the speed of light through fiber. It was developed to reduce miner centralization pressures and network-wide stale block rates. The Chaincode Residency is a program for engineers to develop experience with Bitcoin. Chaincode has hosted several residencies focused on the Bitcoin protocol, Bitcoin Core, Lightning Network applications and the Lightning protocol. Reliable fee estimation algorithms are a vital element of Bitcoin usability. Chaincode founder Alex Morcos designed and implemented Bitcoin Core's fee estimation algorithm. Chaincode has contributed code, design, specification and testing for many of the recent improvements in the Bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin Core implementation. Examples are Compact Blocks and BetterHash, designed and developed by former Chaincode Engineer Matt Corallo; Mempool package tracking and limiting and mining transaction selection based on ancestor fee rate(CPFP) designed and implemented by Chaincode founder Suhas Daftuar, and pruning mode, designed and implemented by Chaincode engineers. Chaincode engineers develop, review, test and maintain the reference Bitcoin implementation. Team Alex Morcos was one of the early pioneers of automated trading and co-founded Hudson River Trading in 2002, where he spent 10 years working to make markets more efficient and improve market structure. He discovered his passion for Bitcoin in 2012, and in 2014 he co-founded Chaincode with Suhas. He has enjoyed contributing to Bitcoin Core and learning about the exciting nascent field of cryptocurrency ever since. Suhas Daftuar co-founded Hudson River Trading LLC in 2002, where he spent over a decade developing HRT into a global trading firm and helping to shape the complex policy debates surrounding technology in financial markets. In 2014, Suhas co-founded Chaincode Labs with Alex to create a place for engineers and scientists to support the development of decentralized digital currencies and further our collective understanding of how such technologies can work. John Newbery has been contributing to Bitcoin Core since 2016. He set up Bitcoin Optech in 2018 to help Bitcoin companies adopt scaling technologies. He helps organize the bitdevs NYC meetups, the Chaincode Residency programs and the weekly Bitcoin Core review club. Caralie Chrisco works with the Head of Special Projects to recruit and create policies to support the team. She plans and executes events and provides overall operational support. Previously, she worked as a technical recruiter after transitioning from her long time former role as a talent manager for actors in theater, film, and television. Russ Yanofsky has done a lot of work to help separate Bitcoin Core\u2019s node, wallet and GUI components. His work to introduce well-defined node-wallet and node-GUI interfaces have been merged to the project, and he continues to work on a long-term goal to run the components in separate processes. Russ previously worked on web search at Google and set-top video software at Videon Central, Inc. Marco Falke is doing ongoing work to improve fuzz testing on Bitcoin Core. He maintains btc_cov, which generates regular coverage reports for the Bitcoin Core unit, functional and fuzz tests. Marco previously contributed to Bitcoin Core as maintainer in his spare time and moved to New York in 2017 to work full-time on open source software. Carl Dong is a contributor to rust-bitcoin and Bitcoin Core who is excited about systems engineering and incentive-compatible uses of permissionless money. Carl has worked on incorporating Guix deterministic and bootstrappable builds into Bitcoin Core. He previously worked at 21 and Blockstream before joining Chaincode. Adam Jonas spearheads recruiting and multiple educational initiatives including the Chaincode Residency. Jonas is passionate about providing the resources contributors need to make an impact on Bitcoin and related technologies. He previously worked as an engineer in the education space after transitioning from his former role developing the talents of professional baseball players. We're Hiring We're currently seeking to hire contributors for Bitcoin and Lightning open-source projects. Qualified candidates must be comfortable working in a small team and self-motivated to help improve Bitcoin technology with the broader open-source community. This is a unique opportunity for those passionate about Bitcoin and motivated to work on open-source projects in a collaborative research environment.
