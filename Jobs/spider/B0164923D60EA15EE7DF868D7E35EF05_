Venture Capital firms invest in illiquid start-up companies yet are the most successful asset class over the last 20 years. Bitcoin Enhanced is an example of a Self-Managed Investment (SMI) - Download PDF . A form of digital hedge fund SMIs are also illiquid in their start up phases. The key to the success of the Venture Capital model is the way it manages risk. We suggest the same model can be applied to SMIs. Here is why. Benefits SMIs are similar to VC backed start-up companies because both create new value. Investors are acting as creators. The act of creating, as opposed to simply owning value gives SMIs important potential benefits for the investor: Diversification \u2013 because the value of tokens is created by investors rather than depending upon an underlying asset, that value lies outside of the risks of the fiat financial system. In this way holding SMIs enables portfolios to diversify away from these systemic risks. Independence \u2013 storing tokens on a digital ledger (blockchain) removes dependence on counterparties to access the token\u2019s value. It is another way SMIs are independent of the fiat system. Capital Efficiency \u2013 because the first tokens are discounted early investors have the greatest potential gain for the minimum capital outlay. No Fees \u2013 Unlike a hedge fund SMIs have no fees. This can make a significant different to returns over time. Learn more. Comparing returns of a $100 investment in an SMI with a traditional hedge fund structure for the same strategy returning 20% per annum over 20 years. Risks SMIs are similar to VC backed start-up companies because both create new value. Investors are acting as creators. The act of creating, as opposed to simply owning value gives SMIs important potential benefits for the investor: Illiquid \u2013 until there are enough buyers on the exchange it may not be possible to exit your investment. Business Failure \u2013 an SMI like Bitcoin Enhanced may fail at any time for a number of reasons. For example the Phi Algorithm may fail to provide better returns than Bitcoin. This could lead to the value of the tokens falling to zero if there are no buyers for the tokens. Risk Management The Venture Capital model effectively manages these risks with: Diversification \u2013Venture Capital firms rely on the 60% of start-ups that do succeed to more than compensate for those that do not. Applied to SMIs the approach suggests investing in more than one SMI to spread the risk of not all SMIs succeeding. Patience \u2013 Venture Capital firms accept start-up companies are illiquid in their early stages and it takes time to grow a great company. They are patient with their investment and do not expect too much too early. Participation \u2013 Venture Capital firms actively help their start-ups grow. They provide expertise and assist with introductions that help promote their firms. In the same way SMIs can benefit from the support and promotion by token holders through simple strategies such as communicating their SMI investment with others. In Ourselves We Trust Bitcoin Enhanced tokens represent a return to the basic principles of sound investing, not just with the natural harmony of the Phi Algorithm but in the way they operate. They are examples of Self-Managed Investments (SMIs): Like Bitcoin and the US dollar token holders give XBE tokens their value. In the same way people kept the value of gold stable for thousands of years token holders grow and then keep the value of XBE pegged to the Target Price of the simulated Bitcoin strategy. The result is: The value of tokens is not dependent upon any external authority, including us the issuer. Token value is independent of what happens in the fiat financial system enabling a return to portfolio diversification. Tokens and their value reside solely on the decentralised blockchain keeping them secure and away from external interference. People with the most vested interest in XBE tokens, token holders themselves, are the ones responsible for maintaining their peg to the Target price. Compare this with an ETF such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). Like all derivatives the value of GLD shares depends upon the value of an underlying asset, in this case the Trust holds near equivalent amounts of physical gold stored in London vaults. The EFT is owned by World Gold Trust Services, LLC. The value of shares is maintained by the continual rebalancing of gold held. In order to do this requires the active participating of fund managers State Street Global Advisors, as well as The Bank of New York Mellon as the trustee of the Trust and HSBC Bank plc is the custodian of the Trust. If any of these institutions should fail then the redemption value of GLD shares could fall to zero. A full disclosure of the risks associated with owning GLD shares can be found in the prospectus pages 6 to 14.
