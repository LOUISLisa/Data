Become an investor Investments can result in total loss and may be impossible to resell. Learn more Become an investor Investments can result in total loss and may be impossible to resell. Learn more Frequently asked questions What is Republic? Republic is a startup investing platform for everyone. We allow regular people \u2014 not just a few wealthy accredited investors \u2014 to invest in highly vetted private startups, with as little as $10 or as much as $100,000 per investment. Republic was created to democratize fundraising while expanding equity investing to the masses, giving anyone the chance to back the next unicorn company. More about Republic How much can I invest? As part of our commitment to broadening investing access, Republic allows investments starting at $10 \u2014 the lowest in the industry. Ultimately, every startup fundraising on Republic sets it own minimum investment, often starting at $25 or $100. Additionally, the SEC limits the maximum amount you can invest across all startups using the Reg CF legal framework based on your financial situation. Sign up to find out your limit How much money can I make? Let's start with the facts: there are no guaranteed returns in angel investing. That's why experienced investors diversify their startup portfolios: while most early-stage companies will likely fail, some may grow, and few may become \u201cunicorns\u201d, bringing in formidable returns (1,000x, even 50,000x or more). Though these outsized outcomes are extremely rare, smaller but still profitable exits through acquisition are also a possibility. In either case, your investment is high-risk, high-reward. Risk note: You may lose your whole investment, so never invest more than you can afford to lose. Past performance doesn\u2019t guarantee future results. Investing in startups is highly speculative. Who can invest? Republic is an open platform, welcoming anyone over the age of 18 years old to invest. We have a diversified investor base with regard to age, gender, income, background, nationality and point of view. Each company on Republic decides what other requirements there are to invest in each unique campaign; please refer to each company\u2019s deal page for details on who can invest. Become an investor How do startups get listed on Republic? Republic is a highly curated platform. We only feature select startups that pass a thorough due-diligence process, followed by analysis from an expert investment committee. To be listed, startups must file their offering documents with the SEC. We believe that the only way to earn trust and build a long-term relationship is to bring quality investment opportunities to our users: of the thousands of startups we review, less than 2.5% end up on the platform. Many of the deals we host are backed by the world\u2019s leading funds and angel investors such as DFJ, USV, Y Combinator, and many more. Our startups range widely in stages, industries and business models, so you can better diversify your portfolio. Learn how we review startups Risk note: While we take great care in curating the startups, we do not guarantee the accuracy of information they provide. Do your own diligence, review each offering information in full and only invest in companies you believe in. What do I need to start? Sign up! We work hard to make private investing \u2014 a process that used to take days, involve lawyers, and cost thousands \u2014 as easy as online shopping. It takes seconds to join Republic and start investing, and you can pay with your credit card. Become an investor We encourage you to review our educational materials and do your own diligence on the companies in which you invest. How should I invest How is it different from other crowdfunding sites? Republic is an investment (or equity) crowdfunding platform, meaning that on Republic people invest expecting a return. They find companies they believe will succeed, and buy a piece of the company\u2019s future. In contrast, sites like GoFundMe, Kickstarter and Indiegogo are only offering you a one-time perk or a product for your donation or pledge. Learn about equity crowdfunding How much does it cost? (it\u2019s free) Republic is free for investors, with no hidden fees or future costs. Republic only charges fees to the fundraising company. Learn more Why do companies want to raise on Republic? Because of our strong and engaged network of investors, loyal partners and trusted brand, companies choose Republic over other platforms. \u201cRepublic\u2019s network and team are incredible\u201d \u2014 Damon Nam, Coinvest \u201cAwesome platform and user experience\u201d \u2014 Janet Wu, Silkroll \u201cExactly what founders need to be successful\u201d \u2014 Desiree Vargas Wrigley, Pearachute \u201cYou guys have built something really powerful\u201d \u2014 Michael Liu, RMR Labs Our many partners in the venture ecosystem refer their portfolio companies to Republic, because crowdfunding has unique benefits compared to traditional venture capital. Thanks to the publicity of the fundraising campaign and the number of investors, companies enjoy a long-lasting marketing effect, with hundreds of investors bringing more than just their money: they bring their network, their expertise and their ongoing support, and often transform into brand ambassadors. How is it different from the public stock market Startups are private companies whose securities are not publicly traded. Public stock markets list only public companies \u2014 that went through an IPO \u2014 usually long after they've experienced their most aggressive growth. Becoming an equity investor on Republic allows you to buy a stake at an earlier stage of a private, pre-IPO startup with lots of room to grow. While placing your capital at risk of total loss, you are betting on the opportunity for exponential financial upside.
