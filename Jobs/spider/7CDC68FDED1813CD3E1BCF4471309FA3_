Technology is rapidly advancing and innovations are happening at a rapid clip. If you want to make a difference in the world, then finding your place in blockchain development is likely to be a fantastic move. There are so many avenues to pursue from security to logistics that any area of interest is likely to lead to a rewarding career. In this article, I will go over several things to keep in mind to help you find your way into blockchain development. Get educated The logical first step is to go to university with the goal of finding work in technology. You\u2019ll need to find the right program so choosing your school at this point is extremely important. Find a university with popular majors being related to computer science. Ivy league schools like Dartmouth are a logical place to look and are not as difficult to get into as you might think. You can find a public university that also specializes in STEM subjects and go from there as well. Leverage your strengths Once you have your degree, you will need to narrow down your options and find the right career. As I mentioned, there are loads of ways to get into blockchain so you need to figure out your strengths and go from there. If you have a very analytical mind, you should look into data science and find an area in blockchain development that supports that. If you love to solve problems then being a programmer that works to develop systems will be a good choice. Find an advisor or mentor to help guide you to your best option that you\u2019ll be able to thrive in. Get active in the community Luckily, when it comes to blockchain and STEM in general, there are lots of places where people in the industry meet. There is almost always a core of very passionate advocates for blockchain and they love to help others and learn as much as they can from others as well. Find these places online in forums or communities like Reddit. Or, find local meetups where you can join in and become part of this community. You could find your future career simply by making the right friends. Move to where things are happening Certain areas become hubs for innovation within an industry. And there are many centers where technology is drawing thousands of people together and businesses follow. The most obvious area is Silicon Valley. If you are at the top of your class for recruits then this is a good place to go. This is where the best end up and you are sure to find your way if you are one. Otherwise, places like Detroit are being hubs of development for blockchain and technology in general. Find the area where things are happening within your chosen area of interest within the field and then actually move there. You may need to intern at a company for a while to get a foothold, but you have more chance of finding a good job in an area where things are happening.
