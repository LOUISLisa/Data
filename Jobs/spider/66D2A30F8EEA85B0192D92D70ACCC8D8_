End-to-end from an intention in a human brain to an outcome on an asset. This allows????????????attack-proofing digital assets under your control in a way that doesn\u2019t require you to have any cyber security expertise. Security scales with the value????????????of secured assets to be as strong as needed to protect against the relevant threats. \u200b We're a????????????team of top Israeli cyber security experts that deeply understand blockchain. We realized that a new approach is needed after running into the limitations of existing approaches while designing the security for a digital asset custodian. Intention-aware verification process Survives stolen private keys Decentralized failure resistance ???????????? Technology Safe Channels Protecting Assets With Scalable End-To-End Security Safe Channels protect????????????digital assets with a reversible failure-resistant process that is similar to the reversible failure-resistant process we use to protect legal contracts like real-estate deals. \u200b All pending operations on assets are published on-chain and vetted within a delay period by a coalition of guardians who stake collateral.
