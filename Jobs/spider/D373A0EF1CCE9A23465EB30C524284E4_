About Us We are the leading staking service provider for blockchain projects. Join our community to help secure networks and earn rewards. We know staking. Networks We invest a lot of time and effort to set up robust validator nodes and put security measures around our nodes. On top of just the infrastructure, we eat our own lunch by having our own tokens staked on our validators. We spend a considerable amount of time doing our due diligence on each blockchain we decide to support. Stake with Us We operate validators on these projects. Token holders can stake with us to help secure these networks and earn staking rewards. Join the staking ecosystem today with stake.fish.

These validators are required to run robust hardware that is online 24/7 with multiple security features in place. This is a lot of work, and that\u2019s where we come in. We are a professional validator that never sleeps so you can stake with peace of mind. Always Distributed Not only are our validator nodes and sentry nodes globally distributed, our team is as well! This guarantees that we have 24 hour coverage of our validator nodes. We can monitor and jump to address any issues that arise. We plan to keep our team in different locations of the world, so rest assured that someone from stake.fish will always be watching over our nodes. Always Devoted We have deep roots in the crypto space. Our founder has co-founded one of the world's largest mining pools. We, as stake.fish, are here to make similar contributions to Proof of Stake blockchains. We invest time and effort to help secure blockchains that we believe will be used decades down the road. Always Secure We don\u2019t compromise on security. We would rather take a conservative approach in our infrastructure than strive for efficiency. Our infrastructure lead, Kris, has been working on systems architecture and infrastructure security for 18 years. He uses industry best practices for our operations.
