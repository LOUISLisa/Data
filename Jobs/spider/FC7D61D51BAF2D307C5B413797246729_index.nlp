Learn More The world\u2019s largest blockchain payment network Terra upgrades the traditional payments system with a single efficient blockchain layer. LOWER TRANSACTION FEES INSTANT SETTLEMENT ONGOING DISCOUNTS Powered by a network of stablecoins Terra\u2019s payment network is supported by a family of stablecoins, which are price-stable digital currencies pegged to the world\u2019s major currencies. Underlying our stablecoins is a protocol programmed to ensure price-stability through an algorithm that expands and contracts overall money supply. Stabilized by Luna Our network of stablecoins are backed by Luna, the staking token that powers Terra\u2019s Delegated Proof-of-Stake blockchain. Much like the moon, which stabilizes the earth\u2019s rotation, Luna and its stakers are Terra's eternal guardians of stability. In exchange for providing stability and security, Luna stakers receive rewards from transaction fees and seigniorage.
