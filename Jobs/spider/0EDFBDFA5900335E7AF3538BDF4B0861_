Applying for a job in an industry you\u2019re specifically targeting is harder. If you\u2019re looking to steer your development career towards Blockchain but don\u2019t know how or where to apply for jobs, this article walks through what Blockchain companies look for and how to find them. What Companies Look For Blockchain companies work on the cutting edge of technology. They\u2019re looking for developers who are comfortable with a wide range of tech and thrive in being uncomfortable. Having a few years of experience as a developer using several tech stacks is a big help. It shows that you\u2019ve professionally looked outside your comfort zone a few times and that you\u2019re able to operate in different environments. This is the first thing companies look for. Experience. Since blockchain is a small niche right now, hiring managers want to see an aptitude towards blockchain development. The most effective way of showing that you have the skills they need is by having a public portfolio. This sounds a bit scary, but don\u2019t panic. You don\u2019t need to have created blockchain DApps for clients. A portfolio can be made up of a bunch of side projects that you made for yourself, tinkering with the technology. This can sometimes be even more impressive. It shows that you\u2019re so interested in the technology that you spend your spare time learning it. Write a list of some DApp ideas, and commit to creating one of them from start to finish. You can even deploy your DApp for free using Testnets and free web hosting services like Github Pages and Heroku. Therefore, the next thing companies look for is blockchain aptitude. This is my least favourite part, but it has to be done. It is the first impression you give to a hiring manager when applying for a job: update your CV/resume. If you have a few years of experience as a software developer, you\u2019ll likely have an old CV sitting in a folder somewhere on your computer. You need to update it so that it\u2019s Blockchain specific, while also referencing your experience as a developer in other fields. This often depends on the job ad itself, but make sure you\u2019ve updated it to include all of your current experience, your interest in blockchain, a reference to your portfolio, and all of the buzzwords and tech you want to get involved with being in crypto. \u201cSolidity\u201d, \u201cSmart Contracts\u201d, \u201cWeb3\u201d, \u201cHyperledger\u201d, etc. Make it short and visually nice to look at. Mine is just one page, and it even has my photo on it. From one glance, any employer should get a complete sense of what you can do. Where to Find the Jobs I\u2019m not going to tell you that finding a blockchain job is as easy as finding any other development job \u2014 it\u2019s not. As I said, the industry is niche and small right now. Although technology is progressing and big players are getting interested, it\u2019s still a long way off from going mainstream. You have to go out and find opportunities for yourself. Fortunately, Blockchain is a forward-thinking industry, so finding a company far away from where you live is not as much of an issue because most of them have good remote working options. Many are 100% remote, meaning they don\u2019t have a physical office. This makes it easier if you don\u2019t live near a huge tech hub like Silicon Valley. Blockchain-specific ad boards Your first port of call when searching for jobs should be blockchain-specific ad boards. Blocktribe.com, cryptojobslist.com and cryptocurrencyjobs.co are good examples of boards that focus on blockchain-only roles. Start here, and apply for every recently posted job that fits you. Mainstream ad boards The next stop is more mainstream boards. These will likely be more heavily populated with noise, so spend a little more time sifting through and finding the roles that attract you the most. Believe it or not, Google is a very good accumulator of job ads. A search for \u201cBlockchain Jobs\u201d will return a widget showing the top jobs near you in the blockchain industry. Google search for Blockchain Jobs StackOverflow, the favoured question-answering platform of the tech world, has a job board that is geared towards developers looking for work. AngelList is a great site that is mainly geared towards finding business partners, but founders often use this to find highly skilled engineers looking for work. Then there are the more general job boards used by recruiters from all industries: LinkedIn, Indeed, etc. It\u2019s worth keeping an eye on all of these sites every day. You can set up alerts on some, like LinkedIn, which will email you when new jobs are posted which satisfy a particular search. For example, any new job ads which contain the word \u201cEthereum\u201d. Meetups It\u2019s not every developer\u2019s cup of tea, but networking is one of the most promising ways in which you can land a job in blockchain. Much of the industry is very tech-focussed, and not particularly recruitment savvy. This means that their presence on traditional job boards won\u2019t be as loud as large traditional enterprises with recruitment teams. Most blockchain companies tend to have very few internal recruiters. That\u2019s why attending blockchain meetups is essential. Not only will you find new companies you didn\u2019t know existed, but you\u2019ll also spread your name amongst the local congregation of blockchain enthusiasts as \u201cthat blockchain developer we know\u201d. Head over to meetup.com and search for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and blockchain meetups near you. Most cities will have regulars meeting every week or month, but if not, go further afield. Make a point of grabbing a 40-minute train just to be at a talk about blockchain and give you details out. This shows how committed you are at being part of the blockchain community, and is a very effective way to find a job Bonus tip: Get yourself some business cards to hand out. I know it sounds corny and old-man business-like, but having something physical to remember you by is more powerful than you think. Direct If all else fails, email the companies you like the look of directly. Tell them about yourself \u2014 make it personal. Attach your CV and any links with your work and what you do. Even if they have no openings available on their website, send your details. It shows a lot of initiative and I guarantee the hiring manager will be impressed by how much you want to work with them. You never know what you might come across. Keep Going Don\u2019t get demoralized by a lack of replies. Keep going, keep applying, and keep your phone on loud. You might not see any traction at first, but you will start to hear from a lot of recruiters about jobs you don\u2019t even remember applying for. Stay positive, keep upbeat and be honest.
