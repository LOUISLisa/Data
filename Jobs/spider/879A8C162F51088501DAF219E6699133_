We made this video to convey a bit about our culture, values, and what we\u2019re like to be around. What next? Cryptocurrency started as a technical discussion on a mailing list, grew into a small movement, attracted hordes of speculators, and then splintered into a zillion useless imitations of itself. We believe it\u2019s destined to consolidate and eventually give way to a battle for power on the global stage. We foresee uncomfortable disruption, a real threat of catastrophe, and a real promise of increased prosperity. Let us try to explain why. Money is broken in some parts of the world \u2013 corrupt governments have a hard time maintaining stable value in their currencies. Centralized, dollar-backed cryptocurrencies are an excellent solution to this problem, offering an alternative to citizens of high-inflation countries, but we worry that these solutions won\u2019t last. We believe the future dominant cryptocurrency will be a decentralized, dollar-independent stablecoin, and it will change the economic situation in many countries around the world.Learn more about our vision here Join the conversation on Telegram.
