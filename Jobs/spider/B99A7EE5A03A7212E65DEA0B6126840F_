Programmable Securities are eating the world of FinTech. Programmable Securities Issuances will soon dwarf the ICO Market. The rise of cryptocurrencies and their faster settlement, improved liquidity and reduced administrative burden is getting people excited about securitizing assets on the blockchain. Securitizing Assets on the Blockchain is not so simple as it sounds. Programmable Securities are not just smart contracts. Programmable securities require extensive legal work prior to issuance, and extensive technical configuration and administration after issuance in order to maintain compliance. The SeriesX team can take your idea from conception to delivery, or assist with any point in between. Just like early stage teams don\u2019t need underwriters or M&A bankers on their founding team, the team that is required to build your blockchain product is different than the one that you need to issue your programmable security. Our team of securities and contract lawyers, our technical team, and our issuance professionals can work with you every step of the way to help you bridge the gap between idea and issuance.
