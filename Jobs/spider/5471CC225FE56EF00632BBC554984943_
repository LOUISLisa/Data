How Much Do Blockchain Jobs Pay? Originally published by Daniel on????????????January 26th 2019 @3repsDaniel Maker: nodesk.co + cryptocurrencyjobs.co + donateincrypto.com Blockchain salaries have risen to be among the highest in the tech industry. Photo by Thought Catalog on????????????Unsplash The demand for blockchain talent is still strong. Despite the bear market and recent industry layoffs, the number of blockchain job postings have been on the rise, and searches for roles involving Bitcoin, Ethereum, blockchain and cryptocurrency have increased. Startups are offering top compensation packages, in particular for blockchain developers, as they compete for talent in an industry where supply is limited. The demand for blockchain talent has also grown as established companies, such as Amazon, Facebook and IBM, launch new teams to work on blockchain technology, and explore blockchain use cases. Blockchain salaries have risen to be among the highest in the tech industry. Key Findings We looked at all the blockchain jobs that have been listed on Cryptocurrency Jobs to estimate the average base salary for technical and non-technical roles in the blockchain industry across Asia, Canada, Europe, and the U.S. We created a separate category for remote blockchain jobs. We excluded salary data points that were either a lot lower or higher than expected. All average base salaries are listed in U.S. dollars. These estimates do not factor in variable compensation, such as equity, signing bonus or any perks a company may offer. Average base salaries for 15 different blockchain job titles by????????????region The data also showed that the highest paid salaries are found in New York and San Francisco. This is also where the majority of blockchain jobs are found. The Big Picture: Blockchain Developer Salaries How much does a blockchain developer make? The average base salary for a blockchain developer in Asia is $87,500 per year, with a low base salary of $60,000 and a high base salary of $120,000. The average base salary for a blockchain developer in Europe is $73,300 per year, with a low base salary of $55,000 and a high base salary of $91,000. The average base salary for a blockchain developer in the U.S. is $136,000 per year, with a low base salary of $70,000 and a high base salary of $200,000.
