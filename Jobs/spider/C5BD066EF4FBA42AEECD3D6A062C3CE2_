If you have ever thought about a career in blockchain, then this is the guide for you! In this guide, I\u2019m going to tell you about one of the fastest-growing job markets in the world. The cryptocurrency market is worth more than\u00c2\u00a0250 billion\u00c2\u00a0US Dollars (USD) and needs all kinds of different people to support it. I\u2019ll tell you what kinds of cryptocurrency jobs are available, which ones have the highest salaries and what the best entry-level positions are. I\u2019ll also talk about the cryptocurrency jobs market in general. By the time you finish reading, you\u2019ll know which areas of the industry are growing and which skills are most needed. You\u2019ll also know which businesses are hiring and what kind of employee they\u2019re looking for. This is a very exciting time for crypto jobs. There are hundreds of opportunities for people like you to get involved in the creation of the technology of the future. So, if you haven\u2019t thought about a career in blockchain, then now is the time to start! Let\u2019s begin with a quick look at how blockchain tech is changing the job market in 2018\u2026 Table of Contents 1 The Arrival of Blockchain 2 Who\u2019s Hiring? 3 Who\u2019s Being Hired? 4 Growth Areas 5 Blockchain\u00c2\u00a0Jobs:\u00c2\u00a0Supply and Demand 6 Final Thoughts\u2026 The Arrival of Blockchain In 2009, a coder named Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin \u2013 the world\u2019s first decentralized digital currency. Bitcoin allows users to transfer funds to each other across a huge network from anywhere in the world. Transaction information is securely stored on thousands of different computers. This means that users\u00c2\u00a0can see every transaction that\u2019s ever been made. It also means that information isn\u2019t hidden on servers at the offices of companies like Facebook and Google, where it can be sold or stolen. Bitcoin is almost impossible to hack. Put very simply, blockchains are a safe way to store and transfer huge amounts of important information. Bitcoin has a very simple function; to send funds from one user to another. However, the potential of the technology Nakamoto created is limitless and now many people have Bitcoin jobs. Note: Want to know more about blockchains? Check out my Blockchain Explained guide. Since Bitcoin, hundreds of other cryptocurrencies have been launched and thousands of different companies have been formed which offer blockchain services. Digital money was the first successful use of blockchain tech, but there are many others now. Every new blog, exchange or cryptocurrency creates new blockchain jobs. Every new technical improvement creates new skills that need to be taught and learned. Ethereum, Coinbase, and\u00c2\u00a0BlockGeeks\u00c2\u00a0aren\u2019t the only places creating blockchain jobs. Almost ten years after the invention of Bitcoin, there are very few industries that aren\u2019t investigating or developing new uses for blockchain tech. Let\u2019s have a look at where the new blockchain jobs are coming from\u2026 Who\u2019s Hiring? There are four major players in the crypto job market; startups, legacies, tech companies and governments. Here\u2019s how each got involved in blockchain and what they\u2019re doing with it; Startups:\u00c2\u00a0These are the independent businesses and products created since the invention of Bitcoin.\u00c2\u00a0AngelList\u00c2\u00a0holds records of over\u00c2\u00a01,500\u00c2\u00a0crypto startups which have raised more than\u00c2\u00a03.7 billion\u00c2\u00a0USD from ICOs in America alone. Note: Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are a way for new crypto businesses to raise funds without using more formal types of investment like stocks and bonds. Startups are run by crypto nerds and blockchain businessmen who saw how important the technology was and got involved early. They are creating platforms like EOS,\u00c2\u00a0Monero, and\u00c2\u00a0Qtum\u00c2\u00a0as well as exchanges like Bittrex,\u00c2\u00a0Kraken, and\u00c2\u00a0Binance. Startups can also be wallet providers, news sites, blogs, and educational tools that have been formed to support blockchain projects. Many of the jobs created by startups were unpaid, to begin with, but have now started to pay very well! Legacies:\u00c2\u00a0These are big companies like banks, accountancy firms, and law offices that have been around for many years. They took a long time to react to the technological developments of Bitcoin. They have seen it grow over the years and now they\u2019re scared. If they don\u2019t work out ways to use blockchain tech, it could put them out of business! Legacy companies have a lot of power and money. Their global reputations allow them to hire almost anyone they want. Most are hiring whole teams of blockchain experts to help them keep up with the technology. Tech firms:\u00c2\u00a0These are the companies that have the most to lose if blockchain tech takes over the world. They are companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook. Much of their success and power relies on\u00c2\u00a0the centralized services they offer. If the popularity of decentralized platforms keeps growing, users won\u2019t want to use centralized networks anymore. Tech firms are having to adapt and fast! Blockchain development has become a high priority. Most are investing in projects which will use blockchain tech to benefit their businesses. One of the biggest projects of this kind is\u00c2\u00a0Hyperledger. Hyperledger aims to provide businesses with the tools they need to implement blockchain technology. Governments:\u00c2\u00a0the cost-cutting potential of blockchain is huge so many national governments have been hiring crypto experts to advise them. In Britain, Sir Mark\u00c2\u00a0Walport\u00c2\u00a0has suggested that a blockchain could be used to manage student loan payments. In Estonia, blockchain tech is being used to make government agencies fairer and more efficient. Projects like\u00c2\u00a0e-Residency\u00c2\u00a0are being used to make it the world\u2019s first \u201cdigital nation.\u201d Venezuela has gone even further and created its cryptocurrency called Petro! All of these institutions are creating new blockchain jobs every day. So, what are cryptocurrency jobs and who is filling them? Let\u2019s find out\u2026 Who\u2019s Being Hired? Blockchain technology is a new science and it changes fast. Many different kinds of people are being hired to do the jobs that this new industry provides. A blockchain employee can come from almost\u00c2\u00a0any professional background but they can be separated into two main groups; Techies:\u00c2\u00a0These are tech professionals like software developers and engineers. They are highly trained in programming languages like Java, Python, and C++. Some will have experience\u00c2\u00a0with crypto\u00c2\u00a0tech\u00c2\u00a0but most won\u2019t. Even for techies, cryptocurrency jobs are a new challenge! Developers and engineers will need to become familiar with new coding languages like Ethereum\u2019s Solidity or the Ripple protocol if they want the best blockchain\u00c2\u00a0careers. Blockchain developer jobs are different. They require engineers and developers to do many tasks which they wouldn\u2019t normally do. Blockchain projects might require them to research, design and build a new platform as well as offering business ideas and plans for the future. Non-techies:\u00c2\u00a0Blockchains need more than just technical support. Like any business, blockchain projects need accountants, lawyers, public relations (PR), marketers and much more. The blockchain jobs site,\u00c2\u00a0Crypto Jobs List, advertises vacancies in marketing, community, design and even has listings for meme specialists! Whether you\u2019re a techie or not, a career in the blockchain is a new and exciting opportunity. Next, let\u2019s look at the areas which could see a lot of growth in the next few years\u2026 Growth Areas Blockchains are threatening the way a lot of industries work but they are finding new roles for people trained in those fields. Below are a few of the skill sets that will be needed in crypto in the future; Media:\u00c2\u00a0The blockchain industry needs to reach a\u00c2\u00a0wider audience. We could see dedicated blockchain advertising agencies, PR firms, and media outlets in the coming years.\u00c2\u00a0Youtube\u00c2\u00a0vloggers like Ameer Rosic, Ivan on Tech and Crypt0 are the first of a new\u00c2\u00a0breed\u00c2\u00a0of crypto journalists. DApp\u00c2\u00a0development:\u00c2\u00a0Blockchain projects will only succeed by building decentralized applications that people want to use. There will be a huge focus on hiring software designers who can build\u00c2\u00a0dApps\u00c2\u00a0for a mass market. Decentralized Facebook, anyone? Note: For more information about smart contracts and\u00c2\u00a0dApps, check out my What is a Smart Contract guide and my Decentralized Applications guide. Legal compliance:\u00c2\u00a0All around the world, new laws are being written about how cryptocurrencies can be used. The technology itself can guide legal contracts (in the form of smart contracts). This means that law firms will need crypto experts and crypto businesses will need legal advisors! Logistics:\u00c2\u00a0The ability to store and transfer large amounts of information could have a big effect on the way\u00c2\u00a0supply chains work. This could mean big changes and new jobs in farming, heavy industry, and international trade. Trading/Sales:\u00c2\u00a0The stock market grew massively in the 1980s and now the coin market is growing even faster! Coin exchanges handle tens of millions of crypto trades every day. They need; asset managers, crypto brokers, analysts, and ICO advisors. As you can see, the average blockchain employee isn\u2019t average at all! Now you know what the blockchain jobs market looks like, what jobs are available and where. Next, I want to look a little closer at the ratio between available blockchain jobs and the people looking for them\u2026 Blockchain\u00c2\u00a0Jobs:\u00c2\u00a0Supply and Demand Demand for blockchain professionals has gone up a lot in recent years. Between November\u00c2\u00a02015 and April 2018, listings for blockchain jobs on\u00c2\u00a0Indeed\u00c2\u00a0have gone up by\u00c2\u00a063%.\u00c2\u00a0LinkedIn\u00c2\u00a0lists\u00c2\u00a02,527\u00c2\u00a0search results for blockchain developer jobs in the USA alone. Of those listed,\u00c2\u00a0483\u00c2\u00a0are based in New York,\u00c2\u00a0360\u00c2\u00a0are based in San Francisco and there are\u00c2\u00a0142\u00c2\u00a0vacant blockchain developer jobs in Los Angeles. So, demand is high but is it being met? The short answer is no. There\u2019s a serious shortage of qualified blockchain professionals, especially those\u00c2\u00a0focused\u00c2\u00a0on the more technical side of the business. Specialist tech recruiters like\u00c2\u00a0Toptal\u00c2\u00a0recorded a\u00c2\u00a0700%\u00c2\u00a0increase in the number of blockchain jobs being advertised since January 2017. Another tech recruiter,\u00c2\u00a0Upwork, has reported that blockchain engineering is the fastest-growing skillset searched\u00c2\u00a0for by employers using its site. However,\u00c2\u00a0Computerworld\u00c2\u00a0estimates that there are only about 250 software developers in the United Kingdom who \u201ctruly get\u201d blockchain technology. Similar shortages can be found throughout the world. These statistics are shocking when you think about how much money the industry is worth! Fortunately, a shortage of skilled\u00c2\u00a0labor\u00c2\u00a0makes this the perfect time for newbies to start thinking about a career in crypto. It also means\u00c2\u00a0that blockchain experts can name their salaries! Let\u2019s have a look at what the four main players I talked about earlier are willing to pay blockchain developers\u2026 How Much Does a Blockchain Developer Earn? What a blockchain developer earns will depend on their level of experience and also on where they choose to work. Here\u2019s who pays what; Startups\u00c2\u00a0attract some of the best blockchain talents. They offer a lot of responsibility and freedom. They don\u2019t offer the highest wages though. The average yearly salary for a blockchain developer with no experience is around\u00c2\u00a050,000\u00c2\u00a0USD. With five or more years of experience, this can go up to around\u00c2\u00a070,000\u00c2\u00a0USD per year. Some startups offer their staff equity in the company, which is a bonus not usually found elsewhere. Legacies and tech firms\u00c2\u00a0offer the best salaries in the business. Entry-level salaries can be as high as\u00c2\u00a070,000-80,000\u00c2\u00a0USD. After five years in the trade, salaries can go as high as\u00c2\u00a0100,000-120,000\u00c2\u00a0USD! Which is quite reasonable, I think you\u2019ll agree! IBM\u2019s VP for People and Culture, Mike Schade, has\u00c2\u00a0said\u00c2\u00a0that the gap between startup salaries and those of more established companies is so large for one simple reason. Blockchain developers don\u2019t like working for large centralized\u00c2\u00a0organizations. Therefore, legacy businesses and tech firms have to offer a lot more money to attract the right staff. Government\u00c2\u00a0salaries vary from country to country but are generally paid less than either startups or established companies. Working for the government does have its benefits though. Government projects tend to involve top-secret data and systems so blockchain techies can pretend to be James Bond while they work! So, big tech firms pay the most,\u00c2\u00a0but startups are more popular to work for. Imagine how Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s life would have turned out if he\u2019d taken a job at Microsoft instead of creating his startup! Before I leave you to consider your future as a blockchain superstar, let\u2019s look at\u00c2\u00a0the steps you need to take to get there\u2026 Blockchain Career Roadmap Ideally, you need to have a background in computer science and software development. If you don\u2019t, then I would recommend doing some training. Your\u00c2\u00a0options are; A blockchain-focused\u00c2\u00a0degree:\u00c2\u00a0Some of the world\u2019s top universities \u2013 including Berkeley, MIT, and Princeton \u2013 have begun offering degrees in blockchain development. A MOOC:\u00c2\u00a0Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are affordable and easy to access. For example,\u00c2\u00a0BitDegree\u00c2\u00a0offers blockchain courses for beginners and more advanced students. On-the-job training:\u00c2\u00a0If you are lucky enough to work in a field\u00c2\u00a0in which blockchain tech is being applied, then you might get retrained for free!\u00c2\u00a075%\u00c2\u00a0of blockchain jobs are being given to employees who already work for the hiring company. Here are three top tips for finding success in your new crypto career; Keep up to date with industry trends:\u00c2\u00a0Blockchain tech is changing all the time.
