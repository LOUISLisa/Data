But where can you find jobs with great tech companies? Well, job boards are one place you can start. We put together this list of the best tech job boards so you can quickly and easily find jobs in your city to apply to. After this we\u2019ll cover some tips for applying for jobs and other resources that\u2019ll help you land your next job in tech. The 24 Best Technology Job Boards to Know: 1. Dice.com While working as a tech Recruiter, Dice was one of the first places I looked to find candidates. It\u2019s an extremely popular technology & IT job board, and is where I\u2019d recommend beginning. 2.Â Hired.com Hired is another great job board known for focusing on technology positions. It features high quality, high-salary jobs for a variety of tech fields/disciplines.Â  3. Angel.co Angel.co is a massive site\u2026 sort of like LinkedIn for entrepreneurs and tech founders/tech workers. And now they offer job listings too. So while it\u2019s not only a tech job board in terms of what you can find on the site, it\u2019s one of the best places to quickly find job leads in the companies you want. Highly recommended. 4. The Ladders The Ladders isn\u2019t only a tech job board but it\u2019s the second place I looked as a tech recruiter, when it came to the job boards I scanned through once per week. Why? It tends to attract higher level people (the job board started out as \u201c$100K+ jobs for $100K+ people\u201d). They backed down from that slogan and exclusivity but it still attracts high-level job seekers, and therefore high-level employers like many of the tech companies you probably want to work for. 5. CrunchBoard If you follow tech at all you might know about the popular blog TechCrunch. Well, CrunchBoard is their technology job board and it lists some great tech and IT job postings. Like most job boards, you can search by location and keyword to narrow down your results and only see relevant job opportunities. 6. StackOverflow Jobs Stack Overflow is the largest online community for software developers to share knowledge and learn new skills. And yes \u2013 they now have a job board as well. This is worth checking out if you\u2019re a software engineer or programmer 7. GitHub Jobs GitHub is a site every software developer should know, but not everyone thinks to go there for jobs. GitHub does have a good, searchable tech job board that\u2019s worth a look for any tech job seekers involved in programming or related fields (like data engineering, etc.) 8. Mashable Jobs Mashable, the popular site for tech news, also has a job board. You can post your resume and search job listings by keywords and city. You can also set up job alerts to be notified when a new posting fits your criteria. 9. Uncubed Uncubed is a job search website featuring jobs from startups as well as Fortune 500 employers. Positions include software engineering, data engineering, data science, product management, UI/UX, and even sales and marketing positions.Â  This is worth a look for any tech job seeker but is especially useful if you have a skill set that falls outside of programming/engineering (for example digital marketing, software sales, etc.) 10. Authentic Jobs Authentic Jobs features job postings for engineers, but also a variety of other positions in tech.Â  You can find everything from marketing and copywriting positions to customer support positions here. So practically anyone can find a suitable tech job on this job board. If you\u2019re an engineer, this is still worth a look. Don\u2019t read this description and write this off just because it includes other roles in tech. This is also a solid choice for engineering positions. 11. TechCareers While this isn\u2019t the flashiest or most modern-looking technology job board out there, there are some very good job listings on here\u2026 and clicking a listing often takes you directly to the employer\u2019s website so you can apply directly and save time. This is a feature we love, because you\u2019re not wasting time applying without knowing if the job is even still open, etc. (It\u2019s a lot more likely that a job is still open and \u201cactive\u201d if it\u2019s still posted on the company\u2019s website). 12. WhiteTruffle White truffle allows you to apply to 7,500+ tech jobs via one application. You will need to create a \u201ccandidate account,\u201d to get started, so this isn\u2019t a job board that you can browse without registering. However, if you\u2019re willing to register and put in the time, it does feature many high-quality employers. 13. IT Job Pro IT Job Pro claims to be the \u201cmost popular tech job site,\u201d which simply isn\u2019t true based on our research. However, they do seem to be worth checking out.Â Â  They have multiple postings within the last 24 hours, and they feature some very high level jobs like Vice President of Software Engineering. They have jobs in software architecture, programming, and much more. However, the employers featured on this site primarily seem to be large banks, and other huge corporations like Sprint, IBM, etc. So if you\u2019re looking for small, niche start-ups for your next tech job, this job board might not be the best choice. 14. F6s.com This is a great job board for tech workers who want to join a true start-up. No big banks and corporations here! They\u2019ve got plenty of jobs in areas like front-end development, full stack development, UI/UX, and even listings of employers looking for technical co-founders, etc.Â  And they show compensation for a lot of the jobs, including equity percentage, etc. 15. YCombinator Jobs A simple, but very good technology and start-up job board by Y Combinator.Â  The layout looks a bit like craigslist: Ultra-simple and plain.Â  But the job postings are good, and clicking a listing takes you right to the employer\u2019s website usually, which we love.Â  16. Hacker Noon Jobs The popular tech-themed content site Hacker Noon now has a job board that\u2019s worth checking out.Â  You can search easily by category, keyword and/or location to find tech jobs, primarily engineering.Â  17. Smashing Magazine Job Board This is another content site that got into the job board business and did a pretty good job of it. Their technology-focused job board has a nice modern interface and is easy to search and use to find tech jobs.Â  They feature technology jobs in the US, EU, and other locations.Â  18. Venture Loop Another true start-up job board, Venture Loop features 61,000+ start-up jobs at the time of writing this. They feature a variety of start-up tech jobs, many for VC-funded companies.Â  19. Underdog This job site lets you apply to multiple top technology jobs in 60 seconds. They feature top tech firms like Foursquare, Jet, Airtable, SeatGeek and more.Â  20. Jobs Match Skills We weren\u2019t sure what to think of this tech job board at first glance. They\u2019re not popular and they don\u2019t get a lot of traffic. But the listings look good, and clicking a job posting takes you directly to the employer\u2019s website, which we love (as mentioned earlier). They have a unique interface that shows which key skills each job features, and they seem to have a steady flow of jobs. We saw 100+ jobs posted just today, which seemed almost too good to be true, but could be possible. This seems 100% focused on US technology jobs, so this isn\u2019t the best site to find EU technology jobs. Keep reading for a separate section for EU residents.Â  21. Tech Fetch Tech Fetch is a great site featuring 100,000+ tech jobs across the US. They also offer instant job alerts if you want to upload your resume and be notified when new jobs are posted that match your skills. They offer a \u201cquick apply\u201d feature to upload your resume and submit it to a company with just a few clicks, but you will need to register an account to do apply to any jobs. 22. Work In Startups This site is for EU job seekers. You\u2019ll find a good mix of technology jobs for EU start-ups here. Note this includes the UK, too. We saw a large number of tech jobs in London, for example.Â  23. Honeypot Honeypot is another EU-focused technology job board. They work a bit differently, though.Â  Here\u2019s how they describe their site: \u201cCreate a profile and let companies apply to you.\u201d So if you\u2019re a tech job seeker in Europe and that sounds interesting, we\u2019d recommend this. If you\u2019re not in the EU, and/or you don\u2019t love the idea of uploading info and waiting for technology companies to show interest in you, then this isn\u2019t the best choice. 24. Relocate.me Want to relocate? This is the job site for you. This job board is exclusively focused on jobs with relocation packages. The job listings seem to be primarily EU-focused, but it does include US tech jobs, too.Â  More Tech/IT Job Boards by Niche: If you\u2019re not satisfied with the list above, here are some additional job sites that are smaller and focused on specific categories of jobs in tech. These IT/tech job boards are focused on niches like Ruby, Python, Android, as well as a few job boards for specific geographic regions.Â  AndÂ  if you\u2019re on the creative side of the technology industry \u2013 in areas like design, marketing, user interface, etc, keep reading because we\u2019ve included those too. Here\u2019s the full list of other tech job boards\u2026 Remote Jobs in Tech: We just published a list of the best remote job boards HERE, and many of them are focused on tech positions.

Some job boards will give you a chance to provide a cover letter. Here\u2019s how to do it in a way that\u2019ll set you apart and get you the interview: 2. If you\u2019re looking for your first job in tech, here\u2019s an article on how to find a job without any work experience. This will help you get hired if you\u2019re looking for your first job in tech without any past experience. 3. Along with applying for jobs and preparing for interviews, make sure you\u2019re sending \u201cthank you\u201dÂ  emails after each interview, to each person you met. (A separate email for each). Sure, some hiring managers don\u2019t care, but some do, and you never know which is which! This really can set you apart and show employers you care about their job, which makes them more eager to hire you. 4. Next, here are 8 tough brain-teaser interview questions asked by large tech companies like Apple, Google and others. While some companies have abandoned this type of question in tech interviews, some still ask them. So that article will help you mentally prepare for the types of questions they might throw at you. 5. Here\u2019s how to create the best elevator pitch possible for when they ask you \u201cTell me about yourself\u201d in the interview. Usually this is one of the first things they\u2019ll ask when you get on the phone with them (in tech or ANY industry really), so it\u2019s something you definitely want to be ready for.
