How does multisig work? + - \u201cMultisig\u201d is short for multi-signature, and it means that spending funds requires more than one approval or \u201csign-off.\u201d Casa is not reinventing the wheel when it comes to multisig technology. We use battle-tested, open source, pay-to-script-hash multisig technology that has been live on Bitcoin for 8 years, and today is protecting nearly 6 million Bitcoin ($50 billion). We do NOT use Shamir\u2019s secret-sharing, experimental cryptographic techniques, or other off-chain multisig schemes. Can Casa ever access my Bitcoin? + - Casa can never access your funds - even if we wanted to. With multisig, multiple keys are required to spend your Bitcoin, and Casa only ever has access to 1 key (for use in emergencies only). This also means that it\u2019s impossible for Casa to ever stop you from accessing your Bitcoin. And that even if Casa were under attack, your funds would still be 100% safe from thieves or hackers. Casa was architected with a \u2018Can\u2019t Be Evil\u2019 principle. How does the free trial work? + - You can try Casa Gold for free for 30 days. Get Started Now. \u200d During your free trial, there are no commitments and you won\u2019t be charged anything. You\u2019ll have full access to Casa\u2019s technology and team, and you can decide if it\u2019s a fit for your needs. After 30 days, your membership will start and your credit card will be charged $120.???????????? How does Casa protect my privacy? + - We\u2019ve designed Casa to maximize your privacy and safety. The only customer data we require or store is an email address and a first name (or pseudonym). We take this commitment seriously. And equally important is the information we don\u2019t collect: - No KYC information - No third-party analytics - No location tracking Many clients choose to maximize their privacy by signing up with a pseudonymous email address. This is something we welcome and encourage, and all Platinum and Diamond memberships include a free personal privacy audit. \u200d Learn More: Casa\u2019s CTO Jameson Lopp featured in The New York Times - How a Bitcoin Evangelist Made Himself Vanish, in 15 (Not So Easy) Steps\u200d\u200d What if something happens to Casa? + - It\u2019s our responsibility to help you prepare for all situations, even catastrophic scenarios. In the event that Casa is ever unreachable, your funds are safe and can be accessed using open source software. We\u2019ve designed it this way so that you can always access your coins, no matter what. We provide all clients with step-by-step instructions to make this process simple and straightforward. We call these the Casa Sovereign Recovery Instructions, and even rehearse this process upfront with our Platinum and Diamond clients. How much Bitcoin can I store in Casa? + - Gold is built to secure $1,000 - $50,000 worth of Bitcoin. We recommend Platinum if you are protecting $50,000 - $500,000 in BTC. Diamond has no upper limit, and is optimized for $100,000 and above. How does the setup process work? + - For Gold memberships, you can bring your own hardware device(s), download the Keymaster app, and get started immediately. For Platinum and Diamond, Casa\u2019s team walks you through a simple, curated setup process: 1) Receive your hardware devices in the mail. - Includes everything you need in one discreet package. 2) Book your Key Ceremony and graduate to multisig. - Your Client Advisor walks you through a personalized onboarding and OpSec review. 3) Ongoing security and service. - We\u2019ll keep you up to speed on all the security developments you need to know about. - Message us any time you have a question, need a free device replacement, or just want to chat.
