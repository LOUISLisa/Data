The survey places San Francisco and New York at the top of a list of the 20 best US cities for blockchain jobs, according to the data collected. Crypto Fund Research representatives said the team used a data-driven approach to analyze five key indicators of the health of blockchain job markets in more than 300 U.S. cities. \u201cWe started by examining over three million job listings across four sites and isolated blockchain-specific jobs, but this was the easy part and this factor makes up only 30 percent of our overall ranking,\u201d a statement said. The team next evaluated cities by the number of top blockchain startups, new blockchain companies, crypto funds, and the status of the overall employment market While previous studies on the blockchain jobs market have looked only at internet job postings, this analysis includes an in-depth look at four additional indicators of the overall health of the blockchain job market for more than 350 US cities. Per the study, the top 20 US cities for blockchain jobs are as follows: -San Francisco, CA \u2013 New York, NY \u2013 Chicago, IL \u2013 Los Angeles, CA \u2013 Boston, MA \u2013 Palo Alto, CA \u2013 Austin, TX \u2013 Menlo Park, CA \u2013 Seattle, WA \u2013 Denver, CO \u2013 Atlanta, GA \u2013 Sunnyvale, CA \u2013 Mountain View, CA \u2013 San Jose, CA \u2013 Portland, OR \u2013 San Diego, CA \u2013 Nashville, TN \u2013 Oakland, CA \u2013 Santa Clara, CA \u2013 Washington, DC \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that San Francisco and New York top the list of best cities for blockchain jobs,\u201d said Josh Gnaizda, founder of Crypto Fund Research. \u201cHowever, less obvious were very strong showings from cities like Austin, Nashville, and Portland.\u201d Crypto Fund Research\u00c2\u00a0provides research on the cryptocurrency and blockchain investment industry.
