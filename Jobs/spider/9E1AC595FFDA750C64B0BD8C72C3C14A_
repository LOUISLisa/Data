Paypal and Venmo have over 330 million active users and the platform facilitates the receipt of money in over 100 currencies, \u201cMy understanding is that they are going to allow buys and sells of crypto directly from PayPal and Venmo,\u201d a well-placed industry source told \u00c2\u00a0Ian Allison at CoinDesk. \u201cThey are going to have some sort of a built-in wallet functionality so you can store it there.\u201d \u00c2\u00a0The industry source added they expected PayPal: \u201c\u2026would be working with multiple exchanges to source liquidity.\u201d PayPal declined to comment to Blockchain News on the plans. In 2019, Paypal joined the Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency project Libra but soon dropped out after CEO Mark Zuckerberg started taking heat from the US Congress and other politicians. Other financial services including cryptocurrency integration from the startup side include Revolut and Cashaa in the UK. Revolut is a mobile bank that added cryptocurrency as a service and Cashaa,\u00c2\u00a0 originally founded for remittance payments globally, shifted to a pure cryptocurrency-led bank in 2018. Wirex Bank is also well known in the blockchain community as a crypto-centric institution. Also published on Medium.
