Losses and security issues can happen. Protos\u2019 tested six fully systematic quant strategies over years to prove a system that captures runs, avoids loss, and protects with best available custody. Protos Bitcoin Quant 1 BTC placed into a Protos BTC Quant Account in 2018 has turned into 3.7 BTC (until end of March 2020), outperforming BTC by 266% with better risk adjusted return (Sharpe ratio of 0.56 versus BTC\u2019s -0.09). Protos Ethereum Quant 1 ETH placed into Protos ETH Quant in 2018 has turned into 6.75 ETHÂ (until end of March 2020), outperforming ETH by 574% with a 0.48 sharpe ratio versus ETH\u2019s -0.20. Protos BTC & ETH Quant Accounts When you invest in a Protos Quant Account you\u2019re getting the benefits of a proven fully systematic BTC/ETH trading system with the piece of mind that comes with dealing with an established and accountable Swiss regulated asset management firm that uses best-in-class service providers.

When crypto drops, it moves out to avoid loss. When funds are out of the market, it uses them to earn low risk monthly yield on highly established and vetted crypto lending platforms. The system is fully systematic and does not use leverage or take short positions.
