Location: Kyrgyzstan Application Close: 29 Jun 2020 05:30 PM Programme Specialist - Resilience, ( P-3), Temporary Appointment # 113727,Nairobi, Kenya The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does i.e. in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children's rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimension, her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society's most disadvantaged citizens i.e. addressing inequity not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.
