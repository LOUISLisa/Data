CryptoJobList As with previous platforms, many large crypto companies are promoting the need for a workforce here. Recently listed advertisers include Status, 0x Protocol, Circle, Metamask, Brave, ShapeShift, etc. Jobs can be searched by category, location and job type.

Other Places to Find Jobs In addition to the major platforms described above, blockchain and cryptocurrency jobs can be found on some other job posting portals.

Search Facebook for blockchain jobs or some similar term, filter the results only to Facebook groups and you\u2019ll get quite a few results, including some large and active groups with a good job offer. On Reddit, visit the subreddit on https://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins/ with over 27,000 members where you can find listings of jobs paid in Bitcoin.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Payment Regardless of which platform you will use, it\u2019s important to keep yourself informed about payment methods. It\u2019s not uncommon for some of the smaller companies to offer you a payment in their token. In a situation like this, make sure to check the liquidity of that token, on which exchanges it is listed on and whether you can exchange it for Bitcoin, Ether, or some stablecoin. For that you can use platforms like Coinmarketcap, Messari or Coingecko. If none of the above has worked for you, you can always create a list of blockchain companies you want to work for, find contact information on their web pages and contact them directly. Employers will often appreciate this approach and this will help you to stand out from the crowd. We hope that this guide will help you to launch your career in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. \u00c2\u00a0Good luck! You can also follow Moj Kripto on Facebook and Twitter profiles.
