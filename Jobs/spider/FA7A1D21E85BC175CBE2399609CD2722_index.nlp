Isabelle Applications Development Supervisor Tenure at Citi: 2 years and 5 months How did you begin a career in Technology? As a Computer Science graduate from NTU, I wanted to work somewhere where I would be able to make use of my technical skills, as well as explore the world of finance. Citi seemed like the perfect place for me to give me the exposure in both Technology and Finance. I was also drawn to Citi\u2019s Technology Management Associate Program, as I knew that being in the program would equip me with the technical skills, in-depth business knowledge, as well as interpersonal skills that would accelerate my career development. The rotation structure would also give me the exposure to different parts of the bank and help me decide on my final placement after the program. What does your day-to-day job entail and what do you like most about it? My current role in GCT\u2019s Digital Department allows me to work with stakeholders from Technology, Business, and Citi\u2019s external partners. I am currently the lead of Emerging Payments module for the Enterprise Service Bus team in the Digital Department and am also part of the team spearheading a new initiative \u2013 Citi E-Marketplace, which will not only add value to Citi\u2019s consumers, but also Citi and it\u2019s partner merchants, too. What I love most about my role is being able to make a difference in the lives of Citi\u2019s consumers, which includes yours and mine, too. What do you enjoy most about your role? I enjoy being able to interact with stakeholders from Technology and Business, as it helps me to understand the different perspectives of these stakeholders and helps bridge the gap whenever necessary. I also love working on new digital-related ideas and turning them it into reality. What skill set does someone working in this kind of area need? I think an important attribute someone working in this area would need to have is the willingness to learn. As technology is constantly evolving, we need to consistently upgrade ourselves in order to stay relevant. Hence, it is essential that one is able to adapt according to the needs of the organization. What advice would you give to someone looking to break into a career in Technology? Go for it! You never know till you try. I feel that as long as you are willing to put in the extra effort to learn new technical skills, you will be able to ease into the technical role in no time. Where can a career at Citi/Technology take you? I think a career in Citi/Technology gives me endless opportunities \u2013 not just locally, but around the world, too. The only limitation to where your career can take you is yourself. More often than not, we find ourselves too shy to ask for what we want. Not all of us are lucky enough to have opportunities thrown on our lap; hence, in order to reach our career aspirations, we must be willing to speak up for ourselves. What makes Citi a great place to work? My favourite parts about Citi include culture, people, and opportunities. I will elaborate on culture in the next question. As for people, I think I have been very lucky throughout my career with Citi to have been able to work with such fantastic people. In the four teams I have worked with so far, everyone I met was always ever so willing to share their knowledge with me, and lend me a helping hand when I needed. It is their energy and intelligence that stretches and motivates me to further my career. I have also gotten a countless number of opportunities here in Citi \u2013 the opportunity to learn through various trainings; the opportunity to lead initiatives, be it within my job scope or through Citi\u2019s APAC O&T Women In Leadership (WIL) Council and CitiClub; the opportunity to try different job roles through the Technology Analyst Program, etc., which I am incredibly thankful for. What is the culture like at Citi? I think a large part of Citi\u2019s culture is made up of the various clubs/groups in Citi. To give an idea of what the culture in Citi is like, let me share my experience at the clubs that I was most involved in \u2013 CitiClub and the APAC O&T WIL Council. Through CitiClub, I was not only able to engage with my fellow employees by organizing various employee-engagement activities, I was also able to collaborate with like-minded people to pursue various passions, such as playing sports or giving back to society. As the Engagement Lead of APAC O&T WIL Council, I was able to raise awareness of gender issues, help O&T women to achieve both their personal and career goals, as well as to promote diversity at the workplace. Personally, I see diversity as an important element for growth, as teams with diverse backgrounds usually work better together and produce more effective results. It is heartening to see that Citi takes diversity in the organization seriously, as evidenced by the various diversity-related initiatives in place. More Yoshi Markets and Securities Services Technology \u2013 Australia Production Support Lead Tenure at Citi: 10 years Can you tell me a bit about yourself and your background? When I first introduce myself to someone new, or someone who doesn\u2019t quite know me sees my name, more often than not a perception is formed that I am Japanese. Although I do have a Japanese name and although I was indeed born in Japan, it\u2019s not quite so simple. Through my family, I have Vietnamese and Chinese heritage \u2013 although living here in Sydney, Australia for practically my whole life, I consider myself an Aussie. When I\u2019m not at work, I enjoy being active outdoors, whether it be playing basketball, going to the beach, or going for weekend road trips. How did you begin a career in Technology? After graduating from Sydney University with a Software Engineering degree, I started my career at Citi as a graduate. I was hired into the Equities Production Support team, which allowed me to enhance my technical skills and develop an understanding of financial markets/business trading flows. Over the years, I was fortunate to have multiple internal opportunities opened up to me, where I now lead the Markets and Securities Services (MSST) Production Support team in Australia. What does your day-to-day job entail and what do you like most about it? Working for MSST Production Support keeps you on your toes (literally). The Support team sits with the Markets traders on the Dealing Room Trading Floor. For someone who hasn\u2019t seen what a trading floor looks like, imagine a large hall full of computer screens stacked side by side, big-screen electronic notice boards, traders standing and shouting instructions at each other and phones constantly ringing. The noise and furious pace of the trade floor can be quite a spectacle. The MSST Production Support team is responsible for keeping trading systems up and functional, allowing the traders to transact on behalf of the firm or on behalf of clients. What do you enjoy most about your role? Every day on the trade floor brings something new, e.g., winning new clients and learning new business flows, keeping up with constant change both internally and externally, such as changes to infrastructure, technology enhancements, and market regulations, and continuously looking for ways to stay on top of our competitors. This is a fast-paced area, and those that remain stagnant will fall behind! What skill set does someone working in this kind of area need? A tertiary qualification in Business Information Technology or Computer/Software Engineering is recommended. Knowledge of financial markets is useful. Experience with multiple operating systems, databases, programming languages are key technical requirements. We also look for people with strong soft skills such as communication (both written and verbal), time management, and being able to succeed in a demanding environment. What advice would you give to someone looking to break into a career in Technology? Technology is the future! Why wait? Technology companies are always looking to make things faster, bigger (or smaller, depending on what the object is), more stable, having improved performance. This is an exciting age we are living in. Where can a career at Citi take you? From starting my career 10 years ago as a graduate to now being responsible for production support of Australia\u2019s Markets and Securities Services business, this is an example of where your career at Citi could go. Leveraging from your existing networks/connections and constantly looking to build new networks will hopefully open up opportunities for you as it did to me. What makes Citi a great place to work? Working for a global company, there are countless career mobility/career opportunities that could take you around the world. With so many different departments, you\u2019re bound to meet great people at work. Citi also promotes personal development and offers a vast range of training programs covering technical areas, interpersonal behaviours and leadership programs. What you take away from these training sessions can help you in the workplace but can also be applied to your everyday lifestyle. What is the culture like at Citi? Citi is a diverse workplace full of employees with a wide range of backgrounds. Cultural events, such as Diwali and Chinese New Year, are celebrated at work. Much thought goes into the planning of these events, which shows the appreciation and respect the company has of its employees. Citi also uses a framework to recognize employees who provide significant contributions toward company goals. Recognition is one of the common motivating factors for employees, so it\u2019s great to see that in use here at Citi. More Michelle Assistant Manager, FX Technology Tenure at Citi: 1.5 years Can you tell me a bit about yourself and your background? I graduated from the National University of Singapore in 2016 with a Computer Engineering degree. I first joined Citi in July 2016 under the Technology Analyst Program, which seeks to provide structure and exposure to fresh graduates joining Citi Technology. I have always been interested in technology from my childhood days, and actively pursuing it as my university education was a real joy for me. In my spare time, I like to stay active by doing Mixed Martial Arts or playing soccer. I also enjoy making music and reading. How does your role/department impact the larger Citi organization? My department is committed to developing innovative solutions to enhance the process of Foreign Exchange trading via FX Connect (a third-party vendor application). We target to build a bridge between Citi VELOCITY and FX Connect, seamlessly integrating the end-to-end workflow between both applications and providing our users with greater ease of use. How did you begin a career in your department/line of business? I began my career in the FX Technology in September 2017 as part of the requirements for the Technology Analyst Program. This is my second and final rotation under the program and, so far, it has been a valuable and fruitful experience. My first rotation was a one-year stint in Commodities Technology, which was fulfilling as well. What does your day-to-day job entail and what do you enjoy most about it? My day-to-day job consists of resolving issues and fixing bugs that are found in the application. My manager often challenges me with new enhancements to be made, and is open to hearing my opinions. I always get a sense of fulfillment when I see my changes working in a live environment. I enjoy the open discussions I have with my teammates and the freedom I get to creatively implement my changes. What skill set does someone working in this kind of area need? A curious mind and dedication to deliver beyond expectations. Anyone who is open to learning and exploring new solutions will fit well in this area. What advice would you give to someone looking to break into a career in your department? Read a lot and practice what you have read. Be proactive and eager to learn from people. Technology is constantly changing, and you will never know what you can learn from someone else. Where can a career at Citi take you? FX Technology offers vast opportunities, as the business is stable and established. With teams spread across the world, this department makes global mobility a viable and realizable option. Further to this, this department puts a strong focus on harnessing the newest technologies and integrating them into the applications we build. Being in this team will allow me to grow to be more adept in Application Development, and perhaps even lead my own projects and teams in the future. What makes Citi a great place to work? Great people and an empowering culture. The people in Citi are highly collaborative and are always willing to share what they know. They promote inclusiveness and I have never once felt left out. Citi believes in empowering its employees through training and celebrating excellence. Not only am I often compelled to do better and to push the boundaries of innovation and technology, I also find myself enabled to do so through the trainings I have access to and the people I have networked with. Do you take part in any volunteering, special programs, or leadership development opportunities and/or participate in any Employee Networks? If so, please describe. I have recently closed my chapter as the lead of CitiClub Singapore\u2019s Terrific Thursdays committee. It is a committee that organizes weekly workshops on Thursdays to empower and engage Citi\u2019s employees. In 2017, we had a total of 1,429 participants across 21 events that we held, a 38% increase from the previous year. I continue to actively engage myself in CitiClub activities and provide assistance whenever required. In 2018, my goal is to be more involved in groups advocating diversity in the workplace \u2013 groups such as Women in Leadership (WIL) or Women in Technology (WiT). In addition to this, I hope to be able to participate in more leadership development programs sometime in the future. More Madhuri Senior Vice President Tenure at Citi: 14 years 9 months Can you tell me a bit about yourself and your background?

Started my career in 2004 as a software engineer and worked on several important initiatives for organizations like Principal Financial Group, HSBC and Patni before joining Citi. How did you begin a career in Technology?
