Andrej Grobler COO Blocktrade I am a digital transformation consultant and blockchain technology enthusiast with more than 15 years of international experience in the financial industry. I moved to fintech in 2018, and it was the perfect timing: New technologies and flexible teams are bringing new lifeblood to the financial ecosystem. It is exciting to shape this innovative future, together with so many bright individuals. At Cryptix, I strive for operational excellence, and I am always willing and excited to learn and grow. Andrew Miliy Head of Software Engineering I like the variety of challenging tasks we face every day at Cryptix and the digital payment technologies we use to bring the oligopolistic payment market back into the hands of consumers and merchants. As a software architect and polyglot programmer, blockchain and machine learning technologies became my hobbies years ago. The systems I have previously designed are deployed at BCV, Volksbank, Bank of New York, E-Plus, and Group M. Anika Sztarsich Junior Marketing Manager I value clarity and transparency highly, especially when it comes to sensitive topics such as digital payment and cryptocurrency. Therefore, my approach to good communication is to keep it simple and real while being effective.

To take the road less travelled and seek new challenges with openness, honesty, and passion. Benedikt Skorpik Senior Art Director As the founder of \u2018brand+Co\u2019, a brand and digital product design agency, I continually observe the digital shift affecting every area of our lives today with great interest \u2013 and I want to contribute to making that process a smooth one for as many people as possible. We at Cryptix have the unique opportunity to delve into the complex issues of digital payment and provide simple solutions for the future of money \u2013 to make people\u2019s lives better. Bernhard Koch Founder Generating real value for everyone by disrupting existing patterns is what drives me. In a team as diverse as ours \u2013 in nationalities as well as personalities \u2013 there is one thing that connects us all: the drive to innovate. Having been self-employed for over a decade before working for an internationally active and multi-layered enterprise group has taught me a lot. With Cryptix, I now have the chance to shape and influence an up-and-coming industry while passing on my knowledge and experience. C????????????line Iten Administrative Assistant I am excited to gain more work experience and contribute to Cryptix\u2019s growth. I enjoy working at a start-up where I can make a difference and combine the administrative side of the business with my passion for defining new processes and setting up structures. Another benefit of working here at Cryptix is the fact that I am involved in so many different aspects of the different brands \u2013 including administration, HR, and business strategy. Christian Dressler Project Manager Marketing In my opinion, revolutionised monetary systems for our society are more within reach than ever before, and as a part of Cryptix, I want to do my best to help materialise that vision. I have several years of experience in the fields of marketing and PR as well as multiple academic backgrounds in new media, communication, and web science. Recently, I have worked for crypto-related companies within the blockchain space. Dana Fischer Lead Test Engineer Being in love with quality assurance, my passion for software testing has its roots in my attention to details and it\u2019s one of my core principles.

As a full professor of entrepreneurship in one of the top business schools in the region, I have conducted counselling projects related to entrepreneurship issues for government, larger internationalised companies, and start-ups. Having written more than a dozen scholarly articles about the cognitive and emotional aspects of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial effectiveness, I hope to contribute to the entrepreneurial spirit of the team. Nina Kranjec Legal Advisor I prefer to say yes rather than no because the world would never have made so much progress if everybody always said no or maybe. That\u2019s why I love supporting the inspiring team at Cryptix as a lawyer. My focus areas are in contract law, privacy law, information technology law, intellectual property law, and commercial law. What can my clients expect? A perfect legal framework for digital payment. Siegfried Skalla Solution Architect It is great to work at a think tank like Cryptix to bring further disruption to traditional banking and create cutting-edge payment services.

Simon Rizkalla Software Engineer As a curious mind blockchain technology has been a long passion of mine and here at Cryptix I get the chance to work with it daily.

Tanja Sch????????????r Assistant to the Board I love to coordinate, structurise and organise! Together with my team, I want to establish a strong international back office that helps to turn the Cryptix vision into a reality.
