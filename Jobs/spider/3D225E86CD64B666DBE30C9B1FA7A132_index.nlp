    "Body": "APIs for a vibrant decentralized future The Graph is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS. Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible. Explore Subgraphs A Global GraphQL API Subgraphs can be composed into a global graph of all the world's public information. This data can be transformed, organized, and shared across applications for anyone to query with just a few keystrokes. Say goodbye to custom servers Before The Graph, teams had to develop and operate proprietary indexing servers. This required significant engineering and hardware resources and broke the important security properties required for decentralization. ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? * Encrypted data coming soon Web3 is a new stack for a radically better internet All data is stored and processed on open networks with verifiable integrity. The Graph makes querying this data fast, reliable, and secure. * Encrypted data coming soon So much is getting built Entrepeneurs are creating next level apps to scale human coordination on the internet. It's a new frontier and we're just getting started. DeFi Governance Grants & Philanthropy Marketplaces Entertainment Social On a shared neutral foundation By combining Web3 protocols, developers can build dApps with powerful new features for solving the world's greatest challenges. Agency Own your identity, data, and reputation Reliability Guaranteed to run forever on reliable public infrastructure Interoperability Seamlessly switch between dApps Money Programmable money and financial contracts Security Safe, secure, and private Governance Transparent rules that people have a voice in Launching This Year The Graph Network We're launching a decentralized network to bring dApps to life and incentivize network participants. Indexers Node operators that compete to provide the best service at the lowest price. Curators Individuals who organize data and signal which subgraphs are useful and accurate. Developers Subgraph and dApp developers that build on The Graph and drive query volume to the network. Recommended Reading Learn more about The Graph's design and the future of decentralization.
