Blockchain jobs and salaries \u2014 2018 report Originally published by Kirill Shilov on\u00c2\u00a0February 22nd 2018 @ks.shilovKirill Shilov Blockchain development has taken the leading position at the most demanded programmer skill. By the results at the end of 2017 through the beginning of 2018 Upwork reports that blockchain engineering was second among the most demanded skills in labor market (specialists in robotics was in first place) in the world (here is more in-depth blockchain developer salaries report). Such agiotage is easily explainable. The popularity of blockchain technology gains steam in the field of business and finance, and the number of such companies grows as well. Besides, the implementation of blockchain technology in the classic companies of the financial sector, like Bank of America, Visa, and others, also grows significantly. Large companies and startups alike are looking for developers and architects in the field of blockchain development in the US, Europe, and all over the world, but finding a true professional is often a big challenge. During the last quarter of 2017 the rough splash of openings for blockchain technologists continued, and the growth of its publications doubled. Non-staff specialists offer freelance services from $150 per hour. Blockchain developers in the US earn up to $130k a year, by estimates of Computerworld. At the same time, software developers earn up to $105k a year. Such data was published by Matt Siegelman, the CEO of the data analysis campaign of the Burning Glass Technologies company performance. In hi-tech regions of the US, such as Silicon Valley, New York, and Boston, the average annual wage of blockchain developers is $158k, and software developers get about $140k. We are speaking about full-time employees in American companies. We will provide examples of such companies below, and we will separately specify freelance pricings. In prosperous Switzerland blockchain developers get even more than in the USA\u200a\u2014\u200afrom $120 thousand to $180 thousand a year thanks to active development of ICO and cryptocurrencies. In Great Britain, startups will pay a new blockchain developer no more than 50\u201360 thousand dollars a year, and the large companies pay from $90k to $140k. Blockchain development engineer consultants earn anywhere from $50 to $100 per hour in freelance markets. Matt Siegelman\u2019s research on Burning Glass Technologies in regards to blockchain developer demand has led him to conclude, \u201cFive years ago, in 2012, we could find only a few vacancies demanding blockchain skills. By 2016 this number grew up to 1,838 messages, and 3,958 messages were made in the middle of 2017. It is 115% more than in 2016.\u201d The number of the vacancies connected with the blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and ICOs increased at least at four times in 2017, according to LinkedIn. Over 1,500 thousand vacancies on the blockchain were published only on Linkedin in the US at the time of writing of the article. Moreover, there are positions for CEOs, software developers, co-founders, technology directors, and founders among these vacancies. 2. Specializations The web developer must have experience with projects using open source code in order to get a job in a blockchain project. Having work experience with Github is a good example, and profound knowledge of C ++ is important as well. Solidity is also desirable. C/C ++ is important for blockchain developers since a majority of projects are written on it. But since a number of projects are also written in Java, knowledge of that code is necessary as well. Although many claim that a professional blockchain developer can construct a blockchain in any programming language. A developer\u2019s chances of finding a good place increase if they can code in a native language without frameworks. A basic knowledge of mathematics and algorithms is necessary. Pay attention to the section with the company overview as it is often necessary to show a diploma in mathematics or computer science in order to be employed in American companies.
