By design,Â blockchain transactions are irreversible, thanks to the public keyÂ cryptography they use. Unfortunately, public key cryptography introduces a singleÂ point of failure: private keys. Curv eliminates this single point ofÂ failure by giving you a secure, distributed way to signÂ transactions and manage all your digital assets. Trusted by Industry Leaders Curv Provides Security and Peace of Mind in the Digital Economy Keyless Cryptographic security Curv\u2019s decentralized security model utilizes multi-party computation (MPC) protocols, enabling transactions to be securely signed in a mathematically-proven, distributed way. Complete control and accountability An enterprise-grade policy engine allows clients to define risk profiles and enforce granular policies to ensure only authorized transactions are allowed. Clients decide exactly who can do what. Asset agnostic support No matter the type of asset or blockchain protocol used, Curv can keep it safe. Unlike legacy solutions, such as multi-signature wallets that require the native support of a blockchain to work, Curv MPC can support all tokens and protocols. Flexible deployment Curv\u2019s technology replaces the need for legacy hot and cold infrastructures, which means clients have the ability to define the speed at which they process transactions to meet both client and regulatory demands. Protection from All Sides Our multi-party computation (MPC) protocols provide protection like no other, but you don\u2019t have to just take our word for it. We have gone to extensive lengths to set a high bar for security with our institutional wallet service. A partnership with insurance powerhouse Munich RE provides an added layer of protection, giving Curv customers coverage up to $50 million of digital assets. The product is regularly pen-tested and peer reviewed by world leading cryptographers. In addition, Curv is the first and only MPC digital asset wallet solution to achieve SOC 2 Type II status.
