Want to be on the forefront of building web3, moving beyond the cloud, and reinventing how data is managed online? Feel at home on the ground floor of a dynamic team with a shared commitment to giving power back to users, communities and developers? 3Box is building a more trusting, human and connected web, where users are in control of their own data and developers are empowered to build lighter, more collaborative, more powerful services and experiences based on open data and infrastructure. This is a chance to join and help shape our team at an exciting and early stage: we're one of the fastest growing projects in the crypto/Web3 space and are readying to scale our products, protocols and team into new markets. About the role: We are seeking a Protocol Engineer to lead the development of our next generation protocols and scale our distributed network to global usage and more powerful use cases. You will get to: Help design protocols for distributed user data, identity, and access control Lead the implementation of the protocol, with tight coupling between engineering, design, research and network input to migrate existing users and services to the new architecture Research and develop new techniques, technologies and ideas for improvements, especially in: Data routing model Real-time/low-latency synching or networking of distributed data Public key infrastructure Access control systems Consensus and coordination in an open and permissionless network Contribute to incentive/mechanism design for a many-stakeholder network Coordinate with the teams and communities of related technologies, standards and networks You are likely to succeed in this role if you have... Strong computer science fundamentals with strong knowledge in distributed systems, cryptography Deep understanding of data structures and their impact on processing, indexing, or latency Previous experience with high scale, distributed data systems; for example: Event-driven platforms consuming high volume, distributed data streams Cloud software with real-time collaboration, syncing, or networking across clients Protocols for network naming, routing, p2p communications, or DHT-based systems Previous experience with scaled public key infrastructure systems",
