Get real-time threat intelligence from a crowdsourced network of security experts and antivirus companies. Scan your first file Scan suspicious files and URLs with PolySwarm\u2019s marketplace Welcome to the PolySwarm marketplace, where security experts and AV companies compete to protect you. Try it now The power of the crowd Malware and threat scanning engines, built by security experts and AV companies around the world, converge at a single access point - the PolySwarm marketplace - and work 24/7 to help enterprises detect threats and get intelligence about suspicious digital artifacts (files, URLs, network traffic, etc.). Contribute Contributors View all Incentivized competition: bug threat bounties at scale A threat bounty is an economic reward offered in exchange for an accurate prediction on the maliciousness of a digital artifact (URL, file, network traffic, etc.). In the PolySwarm marketplace, Threat Bounties incentivize a crowdsourced network of security experts and antivirus companies to accurately tune their microengines and compete to protect enterprises. Submit Compete Verdict Ground Truth Reward Enterprises and MSSPs submit, via API, millions of suspicious artifacts, daily, to PolySwarm\u2019s marketplace. Next Step ?????????????????? Microengines scan and provide assertions (malicious or benign) for all artifacts that fall within their expertise. They put their money where their mouth is: along with each assertion, they are required to stake tokens to signal their level of confidence. As seen in Engine D, engines are not required to assert on all artifacts and can \"pass\" when uncertain or outside their expertise. Next Step ?????????????????? Enterprise View MSSP View Once the Microengines have reached a verdict, all assertions are funneled back to the customer. The consensus verdict of the network, malicious or benign, is passed back to the customer. Next Step ?????????????????? In one to two weeks the PolySwarm protocol converges on ground truth for that decision. Next Step ?????????????????? Engines that made the right assertion are proportionally rewarded (to the amount staked) with the tokens staked by the engines that were wrong, plus a portion of the enterprise subscription fees. Try for free Learn more What makes us different Specialized expertise Unlike other multiscanner aggregators, PolySwarm offers the lowest barrier to entry for individual security experts who have actionable intelligence on threats. The Marketplace offers a \u2018swarm\u2019 of smaller infosec shops and security experts access to a vast stream of malware samples and a large market to monetize their niche expertise, simultaneously helping to expand PolySwarm\u2019s coverage of the threat landscape. Economic incentives & penalties Security Experts\u2019 engines get paid to be right, but are also required to put their money where their mouth is when making predictions. This economic pressure incentivizes specialization, and results in higher Signal-to-Noise ratio. Transparency Every supplier\u2019s track record is stored in a blockchain, visible by all, editable by none. PolySwarm provides an objective way to track supplier performance over time, based on their field of expertise. Private communities We are introducing the concept of private -invite only- communities, keeping artifacts in the hands of a selected set of participants. In addition, PolySwarm supports \"anonymous\" participation - only an ethereum address is absolutely required. Traditional PolySwarm How we compare Suppliers Antivirus companies Antivirus companies and diverse security experts Coverage Must deliver overlapping core coverage Rewards based on accuracy and specialization Confidence (SNR) Must respond to all files, even if unsure Selectively respond with confidence Barrier to entry Engine with broad coverage, established customer base No restrictions - anyone with codified threat detection software can participate Privacy Customers can see everything from anyone Anonymous participation and private communities I\u2019m thrilled to be working with PolySwarm because they\u2019re uniquely addressing an important issue in cyber security. Mark Tonnesen Former CIO, McAfee With more and more advanced malware being released on a daily basis, it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to perform detection and understand the motives of attackers in near real-time. We believe the PolySwarm ecosystem is capable of achieving this exact goal. Jurriaan Bremer Lead Developer of Cuckoo Sandbox PolySwarm is leading the way when it comes to blockchain\u2019s real-world use cases, and I am happy to support their growth. Dinesh Dhamija U.K.Entrepreneur, Deputy Treasurer of U.K.'s Liberal Democratic Party; Founder, Former CEO and Chairman, Ebookers.com Given the challenges that this industry faces, the ecosystem that PolySwarm has created enables a much broader and richer level of contribution from all cyber experts to tackle new threats. Very happy to be working with such an innovative team like PolySwarm.
