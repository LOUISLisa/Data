We have a job board too, and looking to hire 16 positions for key persons by the end of 2019. How would the founders game industry background relevant? How serious are they? Our founders, David and Lu, are serial entrepreneurs that have had a very successful track record when it comes to network security, virtual currency exchange, instant messaging, mobile telecommunications and mobile gaming and online entertainment. WON targets an opportunity to bring blockchain to a massive consumer market and we believe our past experiences of building successful products that serve hundreds of millions of end users would be directly applicable in this market space. They believe WON would become a community with sustainable growth that benefits everybody. Do you feel your vision is achievable? Rome wasn't built in a day! Our vision, business plan and strategies for WON INC and the community cover long term (10+ years). This isn't something that can be done in a day or year, it takes great effort and time to deliver changes that are able to influence the industry at a global scale, however we feel with the right team in place, we can achieve this. We already are preparing to near MVP soon with WOB, WON and WOP, and will release the first iteration of products in 2019. We're committed to seeing this succeed.

While this document only briefly talks about topics in a broad manner due to us wanting to maintain confidentiality, we are of course happy to discuss in more detail during the interview process when we see each other face to face! What about those old ads? The journey of entrepreneurs have moments when you make mistakes, but the difference between failure and success is how you turn that mistake into a positive learning experience. When we were first starting in games back in 2009, we made a mistake putting trust in a third party marketing service provider. Once we were made aware of particular ads from our great player community reporting the issues, we immediately took action by terminating the service provider and taking control of all marketing. Those ads that ran for three months in 2009 were not at all in keeping with our vision for an inclusive and great player experience, and we made immediate changes. We don't shy away from this mistake, however we've grown over the past ten years. We think our latest ads that starred Fan Bing Bing as a powerful female historical leader who lead with cunning and intellect with co-stars Aaron Eckhart and Jeffrey Dean Morgan that played during the Big Game in 2017 showcased that we believe it's very important ads reflect the product, that they are inclusive and strive to represent the great community of the players. We hope that other developers learn from our experience, and make the industry better. ???????????? 2018-2019 World Open Network, Inc. All rights reserved. Report abuse Report abuse",
