Self-sovereign identity No central issuer or provider of identities within the Dock ecosystem. Instead, the issuers control the creation and management of their own identities without the need for a central entity. Interoperability Dock is one of few solutions to incorporate standards from the industry-leading World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and VCDM standards facilitating interoperability with other open source technologies. Open ecosystem The Dock Network is entirely open source and uses permissive, developer-friendly licenses. The network is comprised of nodes run by independent validators utilizing a staking system that incentivizes them to run the network. Tamper-proof Industry standard and well utilized cryptographic techniques combined with the Dock Blockchain provide clear and tamper-proof audit trails and blockchain anchoring for time-specific data. Built on Substrate Dock utilizes Substrate, a framework that enables Dock to adapt and iterate upon solutions rapidly for partners.

During the course of its ongoing development, Dock has partnered with some of the leading minds in the blockchain and web 3.0 community leading to a successful grant from the Web3 Foundation, an organization whose principal focus is research, development, deployment, funding, and maintenance of Web3 technologies. Learn more Getting Started: Northill test net These features are accessed via a client SDK that interacts with the Substrate node for Decentralized Identity (DID) CRUD operations and the creation of revocation registries. Features On-chain identity management (Implemented in accordance with the W3C specification) Revocation registry (Facilitates the revocation of credentials) Schema (Specify the structure and types of the credential's claims with JSON schema) Download theÂ SDK Download on NPM open-source using the BSD 3 clause license view on github Once the SDK has been downloaded, it can be configured to point to a full node and then the examples can be run against the full node.
