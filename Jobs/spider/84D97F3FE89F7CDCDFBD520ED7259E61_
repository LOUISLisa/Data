What the stats show More than half of the total blockchain jobs listed are linked to the United States. After the US, the United Kingdom comes in second with about 1,015 blockchain related job ads.

Blockchain for social impact: more blockchain jobs on the way Last month, a recruitment company, Hired released its report that revealed that the demand for blockchain engineers in the world has increased by 517 percent each year. After this position, the second fastest growing role in the software engineering field is \u2018security engineer\u2019, and it has a 132% growth. The blockchain engineer role, however, has been consistent among the top three most paid engineering jobs in the software category. Presently, enterprise blockchain technology has become more practical in the world today. But this application has not reached a global scale. More jobs should be expected from this industry as the blockchain summit NYC is upcoming. Princess Ogono Princess Ogono is a writer, lawyer and fitness enthusiast.
