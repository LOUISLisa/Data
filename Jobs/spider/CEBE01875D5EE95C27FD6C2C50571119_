All with low friction, privacy, and trust. \u2014 Dan Harple, CEO Context Labs Enterprise Grade Core Features ???????????? Ingestion The Immutably?????????????????? platform begins with all-source data ingestion aimed at retrieving all relevant, contextual data sources. Examples of this type of data include public or private, structured or unstructured, batch or streaming and traditional or alternative data. This data gets pre-processed and cleaned before further exploitation. EnrichMent Once data is ingested, the Immutably?????????????????? platform enriches the data in two critical ways. Proofworks?????????????????? provides trusted, auditable proofs on the data for pedigree and provenance. The proofed data can also be published into a configurable state engine as it passes through its life cycle, should the use case require one. Secure Ledger After ingestion and enrichment, the data can be stored on a private, distributed blockchain ledger. The Immutably?????????????????? platform\u2019s methodology features multiple consensus and reconciliation methods and the ability to interoperate with other ledgers as side-chains. This immutable record is completely configurable to the use case. Visualization The Immutably?????????????????? platform then turns all of those outputs into visualizations to provide the clearest possible insights for analysts and decision-makers. The Context Labs team can build a custom visual from industry-defined or customer-defined formats and output them into clean, understandable graphics. Enhance Analytics With the data securely enriched and ledgered, the Immutably?????????????????? platform can exploit the Asset Grade Data in a number of Context Labs, customer or 3rd party sourced analytics. Derive the trusted insights needed with machine learning, descriptive, predictive, multivariate, or network graph analytics. DeliverY This platform and its associated processes provide users with the highest true currency of information because of the Asset Grade Data and Analytics from the Immutably?????????????????? platform. This level of trust results in actionable, intelligence and verifiable impacts across any number of stakeholders. Asset Grade Data and Analytics The Immutably?????????????????? product family provides investors with Asset Grade Data, data that is so pedigreed, provenanced, proofed, auditable, and immutable that an investor can be comfortable trusting the insights derived from AGD to make significant financial, operational, or capital expenses based on it. This transformation from raw, untrusted data into synthesized and consumable Asset Grade Data allows for the formation of Asset Grade Analytics with deep visualizations and derived analytic insights.
