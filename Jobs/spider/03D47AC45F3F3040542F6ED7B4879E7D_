Analysis Home / RH Citizen \u2022 Business Edition / Blockchain Careers: An Exploding Ecosystem ???????????? Unsplash RH Citizen \u2022 Business Edition Blockchain Careers: An Exploding Ecosystem Published on June 19, 2020 Thanks to its massive growth over the last few years, just about everyone has heard about the investment opportunities offered by the blockchain and cryptocurrency world. But fewer people have realized the scale of the new employment opportunities opened up by the explosion of blockchain technology. Over the past several years, the number of blockchain jobs and companies has surged, and the trend doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing down\u2014in fact, it\u2019s accelerating. With a focus on decentralization, blockchain companies tend to be more likely to offer the benefit of allowing their employees to work remotely from anywhere in the world, and the number of blockchain remote jobs is only increasing. Due to high demand and a low supply of qualified professionals, blockchain salaries also tend to be significantly higher than average. Unsurprisingly, the highest demand in the blockchain industry is for developers. Those who can build dapps and work in Solidity, Ethereum\u2019s smart contract programming language, are especially sought-after, as are distributed systems developers with experience in programming languages like Go and Rust. Salaries for blockchain developers range from $15,000 to $40,000 higher than the typical developer salary. While demand is highest for development work, there are also opportunities for content writers, marketing pros, growth hackers, social media managers, and any other profession technology start-ups need. The option of working remotely is a perk that\u2019s a lot more common in the blockchain world. Blockchain is all about decentralization, and for many companies, that ethos extends to having a decentralized team. While most blockchain companies will have some kind of physical office space, remote work is often allowed and even encouraged, and some companies even have completely distributed teams. The growth of the blockchain ecosystem has also created a lot of opportunities for freelancers. Once again, those with development skills are in the highest demand, but there is plenty of work for anyone with a strong skill set and a good understanding of blockchain. Online job markets like LaborX even allow freelancers to get paid in cryptocurrency, adding yet another layer of flexibility on top of the ability to work remotely. The blockchain ecosystem is already huge, and it will only continue to grow. The benefits are clear: remote work, high salaries, job flexibility, and, of course, the chance to contribute to the realization of the revolutionary potential of blockchain. With the demand for blockchain jobs growing faster than the supply of professionals who are qualified for them, now is a great time to jump in.
