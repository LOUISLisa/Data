Spacemesh is built and distributed as a full open source project and all software work done for Spacemesh is contributed to the world as a commons under a permissive software license. The full-time team designing and developing Spacemesh includes 20 of the most experienced, passionate, diligent researchers and software engineers in the world. To get a full sense of the project's motivation, vision, and scope, please read this intro blog post, watch or listen to Spacemesh \u2013 The Space-Time Consensus Blockchain, Proof of Space Time and Better Decentralization, and explore our Github repos. Come and innovate with us at the forefront of the next major tech disruption, programmable Internet money via decentralized consensus on computation. Join a small but able team of passionate software developers whose mission is to build a Spacemesh Rust client which fully implements the Spacemesh protocol. Our team is experienced, our software is based on rigorous academic protocol research and we are well-funded by blockchain-savvy investors such Metastable, Polychain, Slow Ventures, 1kx, Electric Capital, and Coinbase Ventures. This is your dream job if you share our vision about decentralized platforms as the most important technology we need to build today to enable a better future for all of us and if you are looking to work on hard and interesting computer science problems. We offer a competitive compensation and benefits package and a great no-BS dev-first startup work environment: we don't just say it, we mean it. Come work in a flat, open organization where each team member is accountable to their peers for major platform components, participates as an equal in all design discussions, and also works closely with the broader open source community.
