Price & Market Cap Data from: Prices from: Search Reading: Accurate Analyst Expects Chainlink To Sustain Over 70% Drop: Here\u2019s Why Share Tweet Send Share Prev Next News Bitcoin, Blockchain Jobs Openings Are Booming Hitting 18-Month High Esther Kim | Dec 03, 2018 | 13:00 News Bitcoin, Blockchain Jobs Openings Are Booming Hitting 18-Month High Esther Kim | Dec 03, 2018 | 13:00 Share Tweet Send Share The Bitcoin and Blockchain jobs industry is booming despite price deflation, a new survey from Glassdoor has revealed. 1775 Bitcoin, Blockchain Jobs In August The findings, which originally appeared in mid-October, covered an 18-month period from April 2017 through August 2018. In that time, the number of job openings \u201crelated\u201d to both Bitcoin and Blockchain grew almost every month \u2013 even as the Bitcoin price began to fall after December last year. Most came from cryptocurrency names, with Ethereum cofounder Joseph Lubin\u2019s ConsenSys and exchange Coinbase among the top players. Contrary to expectations, as of August 2018, there were more vacancies in the two sectors than ever before, even as BTC/USD 00 fell lower and lower. \u201cAs more employers become interested and invest in the technology, the professionalization of the space has accelerated as well,\u201d Glassdoor researchers wrote expounding the data. Cryptocurrency prices began rising across the board around May 2017. In that month, just 234 jobs were on offer in the US. Fast forward a year and a half and the Bitcoin price was circling $6500 \u2013 around three times higher \u2013 yet the number of jobs had multiplied well beyond that figure, reaching 1775 this August. Glassdoor also lists the top markets for the job openings with New York City and Silicon Valley (unsurprisingly) in the top three. Rapid Growth \u2018Set To Continue\u2019 \u201cThe surge in open jobs has well outpaced the 200 percent increase in value that cryptocurrencies have undergone since August 2017,\u201d Glassdoor noted. Despite the price volatility over the last year, continued growth in job openings suggests that blockchain employers remain confident in the market opportunity and continue to make long-term investments in their teams. The survey was not the only one to identify the increasing trend. In September, analysts found the number of Asian opportunities had increased 50 percent since 2017. Going forward, despite the blockchain industry, in particular, attracting mixed publicity recently, its longer-term growth seems somewhat more assured, says Glassdoor, adding: While the ultimate staying power of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies remains to be seen, the blockchain job market seems primed to continue its rapid growth into the near future.
