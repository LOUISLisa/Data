Oasis Labs was founded by a team of academic and entrepreneurial leaders from Google, Apple, UCBerkeley, and Tor and backed by a diverse range of investors including a16zcrypto, Accel and Binance. For more information, visit: https://www.oasislabs.com/ The internet and cloud computing have fundamentally changed our lives, demonstrating the potential of what data at scale can enable. Data has the potential to provide enormous societal value, foster advancements in many industries, and enable entirely new use-cases and applications. Despite these promises, today much of this valuable data remains restricted and siloed due to privacy concerns. Moreover, when data is shared, users have little to no control over how their data is used and too often it\u2019s misused. We believe in empowering users and developers to protect and control their data in order to responsibly enable data-driven applications of the future. Our platform enables privacy preserving and computationally complex applications, giving developers the ability to build applications that protect user data by design. How does a user know they\u2019re secure and in control when using an application? Our Design team is responsible for creating UI and UX that elicits an unquestionable sense of safety for our users. Achieving this goal will require an empathy for our users, extensive collaboration with our Product Managers and our Engineers and the ability to balance simplicity and utility. Only by helping users understand the way their data is being handled, can we rebuild the trust being threatened by the daily stories of data breaches and misuse. Each team member at Oasis is empowered to make decisions and own large projects. We value open channels of communication, cross functional collaboration and individual growth. You will be focused on delivering critical projects, while staying versatile to adapt to our evolving needs. You will design products that don\u2019t yet exist.
