GET IN TOUCH EXPLORE THE PLATFORM WATCH VIDEO WATCH VIDEO We believe that it is easy to make a rapid shift towards 100% renewable energy and we are here to enable all companies to reach their energy sustainability goals 2/3 of global energy is consumed by Commercial and Industrial (C&I) companies. The transition to fully sustainable energy is not possible without their full participation. Green energy production has already become a competetive alternative to traditional energy sources Cost of fuel* Wind $0 MWH Solar $0 MWH Coal $13 MWH Gas $29 MWH New development** Wind $35 MWH Solar $35 MWH Coal $94 MWH Gas $129 MWH *Source: estimated using publicly available pricing data and average fuel efficiency statistics ** Source: BNEF, global averages But so far, only a handful of global companies have been able to leverage the benefits of green energy. They do it via Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) PPAs are direct contracts with energy producers allowing companies to purchase electricity at a pre-agreed terms for a certain period of time. Traditional PPA model prevents smaller companies from buying green energy directly from producers. We offer a revolutionary green energy marketplace to purchase green energy directly from producers. Our marketplace removes many limitations of the traditional PPA process ONLY LARGE VOLUMES No point of entry for smaller buyers. Usually 1-3 large buyers. SMALl VOLUMES Platform technology enables buyers with relatively small loads to participate in auctions. EXPENSIVE AND LENGTHY PROCESS High legal and financial transaction costs. Average PPA process costs can reach as much as $1M or more per contract and take 1-2 years to settle. LOW TRANSACTION COSTS Standardised contracts and project curation significantly reduces transaction costs to buyers. NO LIQUIDITY To re-sell or decrease the quantity of purchased energy, the whole agreement must be renegotiated - adding more time and cost. HIGH LIQUIDITY Buyers can now \u201csell-down\u201d their contract to 3rd parties via Platform\u2019s secondary market. SINGLE COUNTERPARTY Single party to be relied on for a long contract duration - presenting potential single point of failure risk. MULTIPLE COUNTERPARTIES Multiple smaller parties diversify counterparty risk and reduce its impact. WePower marketplace connects companies directly with green energy producers, so that all companies, no matter the size, can buy green energy at competitive rates with full transparency. Supporting all types of energy auctions Project-led auction Buyer-led auction A Project auctions all or part of its output to multiple buyers via WePower\u2019s Platform. Suitable for project owner seeking multiple smaller buyers. Buy green energy in 3 simple steps On our platform, renewable energy producers host energy auctions where they sell all or part of their future energy production. In an auction, buyers can place bids for the amount of energy production they want to purchase. Each successful bidder secures a PPA, which becomes active once the facility is built and starts production. A Buyer tenders their load to secure competitive offers from projects Suitable for Buyers (individual or group) with large energy consumption Buy green energy in 3 simple steps On our platform, renewable energy producers host energy auctions where they sell all or part of their future energy production.

Choose a procurement strategy best suited for your company All of our energy buying options can meet 100% of your company\u2019s energy needs. We can offer you different contract types to design your optimal \u201cgoing green\u201d strategy for the long term. Our platform is retailer agnostic. We work with all types of corporate customers, no matter which retailers you currently use. We also work both with your own internal energy/procurement department and third-party consultants if you rely on them for energy procurement needs. Virtual PPA Hedge your energy prices without cancelling your current retailer contracts. Our solution can work in parallel with your company\u2019s retail contract or in combination with it. see how it works Sleeved PPA Your PPA agreement is immediately novated to the energy retailer, so you could get both renewable energy and firmed energy from the single energy retailer. see how it works Contracts on a blockchain could be offered off the shelf, allowing smaller companies\u2014and perhaps, one day, individuals\u2014to use them too. Such contracts would be as easily tradeable as any other crypto-asset, creating a secondary market in power agreements. READ MORE Blockchain makes it easier for people to trade on the renewable energy trading platform that connects energy buyers directly with energy producers, giving people and companies a possibility to decide what green energy project to buy from. READ MORE The idea is that by recording every energy supplier and every transaction on a blockchain, the consumer will eventually be able to know - and decide - exactly where their energy comes from. READ MORE By tokenising renewable energy and putting it onto a blockchain, WePower is making that power tradeable and accessible to anyone. And it's giving people more control. READ MORE WePower wants to enable buyers to purchase green energy directly from producers at below-market rates using Ethereum-based smart energy contract tokens. According to WePower, energy tokenization ensures liquidity and extends access to capital. READ MORE Using blockchain allows us to aggregate buyers, that would be very hard operationally to manage if you tried to do that the standard way - via spreadsheets. READ MORE icon--prev icon--next Standardised procurement WePower\u2019s standardised power purchase agreements eliminate complexity from corporate energy procurement. For corporate buyers, we substantially reduce procurement-related costs and overall transaction time from 1-2 years to a few weeks. Buyer aggregation Our standardised and easily accessible process allows smaller companies with lower electricity needs to be automatically aggregated with larger companies and/or between themselves. This process creates a broader and more inclusive market where risks and opportunities are shared and in turn better managed. Your PPA-procured energy is now liquid WePower\u2019s proprietary energy tokenization technology enables you* to sell any part of your commercial energy agreements via the secondary market. We enable previously non-existent liquidity for the directly sourced green energy. *Some clients might be excluded based on individual terms in their electricity supply agreements. Standardisation of renewable energy procurement allows us to reach the goal of democratising access to affordable renewable energy. Contributing to the development of more renewable energy projects By directly contracting with renewable energy projects, buyers are enabling these projects to secure funding and become operational - thereby increasing the total number of renewable energy projects in operation, and displacing fossil-fuelled generation. Rapid transactions By bundling multiple buyers of various size, generators are able to transact faster and minimise the transaction risk. Reduction of transaction costs without complexity Standardised procurement eliminates many unnecessary costs burdening traditional PPA processes.
