You will sit in on the UX/UI studies and take in the recommendations, and work with both the frontend and backend teams to operationalize them. You should be comfortable taking a leadership position in end-to-end features that will make a meaningful impact towards increasing the usability of our product. Synthetic Minds We are building techniques that auto-generate software, for specific verticals, using very little input. The tech is calledÂ program synthesis. We are currently in stealth-mode applying program synthesis to an enterprise use case. We are well-funded with a 2+ year runway, and a few months away from an alpha release. In Oct 2018, we raised aÂ $5.6M seed roundÂ from Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures and Pantera Capital. (Note that we areÂ notÂ working on smart contracts anymore.)

OtherÂ team membersÂ include an ex-Googler with 10 yrs experience (also the first hire at Parse, YC S11), an exceptional Tufts CS major, a UCB PhD, and a UW PhD. Technology We are working onÂ program synthesis. Our tech stack involves work with automated theorem proving (using theÂ Z3 solver) and cutting-edge programming languages/compilers technology. The front-end does a good job of hiding the details of the hard-tech to make it accessible to enterprise customers. Most of the backend is in Python. The frontend is built in React, GraphQL, Django and related technologies. Compensation and Benefits We value our team, and we value diversity. We're a small knit group with less than 10 employees, and we funded with a good runway. Our compensation plan is designed to reward our employees and support their families as much as possible, for a company at our stage. We have: \u2022 Excellent benefits.

Familiar with good developer practices (CI/CD, code review, unit-testing, etc.). Substantial experience with Python 3. Desire to learn about areas such as programming by example, compilers, automated theorem provers, code analysis, and program synthesis. Excellent critical thinking, problem solving, and analytical skills. Solid communications skills. Ability to work both independently and as part of a distributed team. Preferred qualifications 4+ years of software development experience. Experience with AWS, C++, Z3, and Django a plus. Apply for this job Jobs powered by",
