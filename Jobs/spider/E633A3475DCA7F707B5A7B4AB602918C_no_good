These may be the top 10 job seeker sites but they each have an individual advantage over one another. The majority of these sites are search engine based that pull job postings from various sources. Note that each site may not use the same sources thus you are missing out on job listings that one site may not offer. Furthermore, nine out of ten of the sites are free to use, so it is not costing you anything other than time to use their tools. Do yourself a favor and make your job search easier by utilizing the features of these job seeker sites. 1.LinkedIn With over 575 million users, LinkedIn is one of the tops networking sites. Users can create profiles that serve as resumes. Your profile can include your work experience, education, awards, and other content that can best represent you in the industry you are looking for work in.

It is one of the biggest job boards around, with similar features as indeed and job.com but with even more criteria fields. This site also partners with news media around the country and collects job listings.

Glassdoor provides insight into a company\u2019s interview process, work environment, salary, and benefits. This site also allows employers to find qualified candidates and market their companies to job seekers. This site allows present and past employees to give their employer a star rating. 7.Monster You may wonder with a name like Monster how this site relates to job seeking.
