At HashiCorp we have a set of principles that give us a shared understanding so we can act collectively and in a consistent manner. Our core principle is one of integrity. Integrity builds trust, upon which the strongest relationships are built. When we trust others, we are more willing to be open and engage. We must foster relationships internally to create a friendly, productive, and positive environment and externally with our users, partners, and customers to drive the adoption of our tools and products. We also value top-notch collaboration and communication skills, both among internal teams and in how we interact with our users. We take care to balance and be responsive to the needs of our open source community as well as our enterprise level customers. Engineering at HashiCorp is a remote team.
