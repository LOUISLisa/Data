    "Body": "TrustToken ???????????????????????? Hi! We\u2019re a team coming out of Stanford, Palantir, and Google, funded by Founders Fund Angel, Stanford-StartX, and BlockTower Capital, building a platform to tokenize the $256 trillion worth of real-world assets. Website Twitter Active 4 months ago?????????????????????????????????????????? 850 views Company Culture The economic benefits of what you build with us at TrustToken will be far-reaching. For creators and entrepreneurs, we can help offer equity crowdfunding to a global audience. For people who own assets that are difficult to trade (such as real estate, IP, or art), we can enable liquidity and fractional ownership for those assets. For investors, we can enable access to investing opportunities for new asset classes around the world. From a technical perspective, we can give real-world assets the benefits currently held by digital assets: low transaction costs, shared ownership, and programmatic control. For further reference on how the protocol works, please visit our blog: https://blog.trusttoken.com. We have 6 core values: Trust & Truth (TT) - what to serve Data-based Decisions (DD) - how to decide Conscious Collaboration (CC) - how to collaborate Renaissance Ambition (RA) - how to show up Getting Things Done (GTD) - how to execute Make Good Things Easy (MGTE) - how to improve Values We consider the following questions when we hire, promote, award, and let go teammates.
