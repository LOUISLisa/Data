[UPCOMING EVENT] Register for a FREE Crypto Margin Trading Class here:\u00c2\u00a0http://bit.ly/MarginTrading2019 One of the proposed reasons for this increased trend is the long-term potential of the technology and the industry\u2019s expansion well beyond the financial sector and interest among more established firms not directly related to cryptocurrencies in addition to a sprinkling of crypto startups in the space. Below is a list of the top 5 cryptocurrency tech jobs: Software engineer Senior software engineer Software architect Full-Stack developer Front-end Developer A list of the top 10 companies doing the most hiring for crypto and blockchain jobs is shown below: Deloitte IBM Accenture Cisco Collins Aerospace Ernst & Young Coinbase Overstock.com Ripple Verizon From the above list, two of the Big Four accounting firms make the top 10, along with tech giant IBM. This is because\u00c2\u00a0consulting firms are hiring blockchain talent to advise clients on how to apply these new technologies. Indeed also recently published a blog post titled \u20185 Careers Driving Fintech\u2018 which listed the 5 skillsets most in demand in fintech below: Cybersecurity engineer Data scientist Blockchain developer Product manager Cloud engineer Interestingly, the post mentioned the above skillsets also\u00c2\u00a0encompass insurance, investment management, eCommerce, and payment platforms, which means more opportunity for anyone who has any of the aforementioned skills.
