You\u2019ll help fill an important gap in progressive voter mobilization by forging partnerships among student groups across campuses, where increasing voter turnout on Election Day will have a meaningful impact. Swing Left is seeking College Fellows who will mobilize campus communities in their state to vote and volunteer. Fellows will build long-term organizing power through coaching, support, and connection to Swing Left resources. Fellows will also serve on Swing Left\u2019s Super State Youth Council (SSYC), a body that will consult on Swing Left College Program content and represent the team. College Fellows are expected to contribute 10 hours a week and will be paid a $2400 stipend over 12 weeks, plus the 2-day virtual Summer Summit training. For more information on the Fellowship program, check out our FAQs. Please note: COVID-19 has undoubtedly created uncertainty around the Fall 2020 semester. We are hopeful that it will be safe for students to be on campus in the Fall and participate in the fellowship. However, we will only conduct a program in the Fall if it\u2019s safe to do so, and if colleges and universities across the country are open. Swing Left will make a decision in mid-June about the future of the fellowship, and we will let every applicant know accordingly. As always, the health and safety of our Swing Left family is paramount. About Swing Left Swing Left is a national grassroots organization that took back the House in 2018 by building a national campaign for Democratic candidates in 84 Swing Districts in three big ways: recruiting and training an army of volunteers, raising funds from grassroots donors, and building cultural momentum for the midterms. For 2020, we\u2019ll be bringing our \u201ccampaigns-in-waiting\u201d model to swing Senate seats, defend the House, win the state-level races needed to ensure fair maps for 2021 redistricting\u2014and, of course, the Presidency. In 2018 we took back the House. Join us, and help transform our government in 2020.

We believe that the GOP\u2019s bad behavior disproportionately hurts the most marginalized people in society\u2014including people of color, people from working-class backgrounds, people with disabilities, women and LGBTQ people. We believe that these communities must be centered in the work we do. Hence, we strongly encourage applications from people with these identities and members of other marginalized communities.
