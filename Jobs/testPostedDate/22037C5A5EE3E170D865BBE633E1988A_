We already power large CDN networks like cloudflare.com blocking bots on the internet. Did you know the HCaptcha network is powered by a decentralized blockchain solution on the testnet of ethereum? More users rely on HCaptcha than any other blockchain project in history. In many ways, https://github.com/hcaptcha/hmt-escrow is one of the largest crypto projects ever. We differ from other crypto projects in that we are not hype-driven. We are building real ML solutions already used by the largest companies in ML.\u00c2\u00a0 Job Description We need someone who's fluent in python, javascript, and everything having to do with Ethereum. You'll handle the open-source project and integrating it into our worldwide captcha infrastructure.\u00c2\u00a0 You'll also make sure our clients get paid HMT on time and without issue. The two ways of getting this job are either: - if, you have already done a few bounties on hmt-escrow, then just ask to be hired based on your good work on the PR. Paid work on a bounty counts towards our trust in your ability to deliver regularly.\u00c2\u00a0 - Apply directly https://angel.co/company/intuition-machines-1/jobs/807511-web-services-engineer-backend-security-or-devops-focus. Make sure to mention that you are applying for the crypto-focused position. We will want to see a substantial portfolio of work and it's much easier if you have already worked with us in Open Source. \u00f0\u009f\u008c\u008e Remote \u00f0\u009f\u009b\u00a0 Engineering Other \u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00b0 60k-120k Apply now \u00e2\u009c\u0085 29 applications \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u0081 294 views Posted on June 19, 2020 View all blockchain jobs at HCaptcha Similar Blockchain jobs: Frontend Developer - UI at Lightcurve Berlin, Germany 38 applicantsLast: 4 days ago 7w Backend Developer - Microservices at Lightcurve Berlin, Germany 40 applicantsLast: 2 days ago 7w Blockchain Product Manager at Remote IT World Remote,Singapore 105 applicantsLast: a day ago 5w Senior DevOps at Monolith London 7 applicantsLast: an hour ago2d Product Manager at Wyre, Inc Remote (US/Brazil)$95,000 - $125,000\u00c2\u00a0 36 applicantsLast: 6 hours ago6d Browse jobs by Role Remote Blockchain jobs Blockchain Developer jobs Blockchain Marketing jobs Blockchain Designer jobs Earn Bitcoin Hire Blockchain Talent Solidity jobs Crypto Trader jobs Crypto Analyst jobs Community Manager jobs Browse jobs by Location San Francisco jobs Austin blockchain jobs Boston blockchain jobs Chicago blockchain jobs New York blockchain jobs Seattle blockchain jobs Singapore blockchain jobs Hong Kong blockchain jobs London blockchain jobs Paris blockchain jobs Berlin blockchain jobs Hiring Blockchain Talent? \u00e2\u0086\u0092 Post a job for $199 Partners: AirdropAlert Dapp University More partners\u2026 Twitter Telegram LinkedIn Reddit Instagram Facebook Jobs Salaries Companies Affiliate Hire Success Stories Blog RSS TermsFeedback & Support \u00c2\u00a9 2020 Crypto Jobs List",
