Project Leads at Protocol Labs A Project Lead is the person who is ultimately in charge of an open source project at Protocol Labs.

As Project Lead of libp2p, you\u2019ll be the public face of a major open source project, interacting often with the diverse libp2p community. You will work with key project stakeholders to ensure project success, make decisions about where to invest resources, and help define and track key metrics for the libp2p project. The Project Lead is the person who is ultimately accountable for ensuring the libp2p project\u2019s success. This is a general manager role that\u2019s very much like being the CEO of a (currently) 10-20 person startup.

You\u2019ll also have the backing and support of Protocol Labs, a globally-distributed research and engineering laboratory focused on inventing, funding, designing and building new technologies to make a better Internet. You\u2019ll be a great fit if you have many of these... Interest in peer-to-peer technologies and how they can be used to improve the Internet for all humanity.

Extensive experience in open source, including working within open source communities, being a maintainer or core contributor of a major open source project. Expertise and knowledge of networking and Internet protocols such as IP, ICMP and UDP. Interest and/or experience in protocols and products. You should know how to uncover user pain points, make product tradeoff decisions, thoughtfully balance competing priorities like feature-parity, time-to-market, technical debt, backward compatibility, limiting product surface area, and so forth. Demonstrated leadership abilities. Experience building up and running teams. Ability to delegate. Disciplined about follow up. The ability to recruit top players to your team, both from your own personal network and by working with recruiters. An entrepreneurial mindset. You should be comfortable taking smart risks.

Protocol Labs mission is to improve humanity\u2019s most important technology, the Internet. We build protocols, systems, and tools to improve how it works. Today, we are focused on how we store, locate, and move information. Our projects include IPFS, Filecoin, libp2p, and more.

We have a great benefits package, including parental leave, contributions to your retirement, competitive pay, and unlimited time off.
