At HashiCorp we have a set of principles that give us a shared understanding so we can act collectively and in a consistent manner. Our core principle is one of integrity. Integrity builds trust, upon which the strongest relationships are built. When we trust others, we are more willing to be open and engage. We must foster relationships internally to create a friendly, productive, and positive environment and externally with our users, partners, and customers to drive the adoption of our tools and products. We also value top-notch collaboration and communication skills, both among internal teams and in how we interact with our users. We take care to balance and be responsive to the needs of our open source community as well as our enterprise level customers. Engineering at HashiCorp is a remote team. While prior experience working remotely isn\u2019t required, we are looking for team members who perform well given a high level of independence and autonomy. Some of the reasons our team have said they love working at HashiCorp is: The remote-first culture gives me a lot of flexibility to balance work with other personal and family commitments. I\u2019m able to adapt my schedule to fit in the things I\u2019ve not been able to at previous jobs, without the expectation of also being always on. Everyone has been encouraging of having clear boundaries between work and non-work time. What would you be working on? HashiCorp\u2019s Terraform is an open source project that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve production infrastructure via the CLI. It codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be shared among team members, treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned. Terraform Cloud is built on top of our open source project Terraform. Terraform Enterprise is the best way to collaborate, validate, and execute Terraform in organizations large and small.
