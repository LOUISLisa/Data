    "Body": " HHS Technology Group has an exciting opportunity for a strong SOA Integration Lead with strong design and architectural skills and experience in Medicaid, MMIS, or State Government Health technical implementations. Responsibilities Manages the design, configuration/build, integration, defect management, and implementation of the Contractor's scope of work. Mandatory Requirements Minimum of five (5) years leading system design and integration projects, including the technical design and implementation of projects within a Medicaid/MMIS implementation, preferably Provider Enrollment/Provider Relations. Experience must involve directing multi-discipline technical teams producing integration solutions (e.g., Service Oriented Architecture, network, hardware and software). A Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field is preferred. HHS Technology Group is accelerating state government technical solution delivery by leveraging a pre-built universal blockchain technology platform, UniBloc that comes readily bundled with modules and algorithms for membership, consensus, API management, and Peer2Peer communication that correspond with BlockChain frameworks. We've become a valued and trusted systems integration partner for several departments within a number of State Governments. The intense growth and tremendous financial forecast we are experiencing at HHS Technology Group can largely be attributed to our successes on these initiatives and having been awarded the NASPO Value Point Contract (a consortium that shortens the procurement process for technology solutions whereby 22 states have opted in) https://www.naspovaluepoint.org/portfolio/mmis-provider-services-module-2018-2028/hhs-technology-group/). HHSTech has developed purpose-built blockchain product rollouts to facilitate the healthcare industry, particularly in ensuring accuracy with electronic health record management. The company\u2019s MediBook offering\u2014which will be launched early next year\u2014 leverages blockchain to revolutionize the way patient data is maintained by giving complete data autonomy to patients. Though traditionally our team has focused on selling mainly into Health and Human Services divisions of State Government, HHS Technology Group also has several complex custom development efforts with other State Gov departments outside of Health and Human Services. Our main product, Discover Your Provider (DYP) is a provider relations/provider enrollment solution but components of this modular software can be re-purposed or built upon to deliver cloud based technical web services solutions as well. Please call me if you would like to learn more or share this with your network and encourage anyone you believe highly in to call my cell phone at (954) 560-6563. Evenings/weekends acceptable if necessary. Though DYP has historically been marketed mainly to public sector, State Government accounts, we are now selling our product suite into large strategic commercial sector business opportunities with large insurance enterprise corporations. HHS Tech Group employees enjoy a very comprehensive and competitive benefit package: Fully paid dental, vision, life insurance, and disability insurance. Generous 401k matching program fully vested from beginning. Generously sponsored Medical Insurance through Cigna (PPO or HSA \u2013 with company match) SDL2019-64 ",
