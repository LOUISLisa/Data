    "Body": " Faculty Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) is known worldwide for its high academic quality and the social relevance of its research programmes. Offering an international environment, the faculty has more than 1100 employees (including about 500 PhD students) and more than 3000 bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s students. Together they work on a broad range of technical innovations in the fields of electrical sustainable energy, microelectronics, intelligent systems, software technology, and applied mathematics.\u2002 The Delft Blockchain Lab The Delft Blockchain Lab (DBL, https://www.tudelft.nl/delft-blockchain-lab), under the leadership of Prof. Dick Epema and Dr. Johan Pouwelse, brings together all blockchain-related research of TU Delft. DBL is largely based in the two Computer-Science Departments Intelligent Systems (in particular, the Section Cybersecurity, in which dr. Zeki Erkin leads the security-related research in blockchain) and Software Technology (in particular, the Sections Distributed Systems and Software Engineering). However, it also performs research into ethical and science communication aspects of blockchain and into applications of blockchain such as intelligent power grids. Its research roadmap calls for the design, deployment and analysis of a complete blockchain-based software stack for trust in the internet, together with research into the fundamental aspects that support this design. DBL strongly builds on more than a decade of research in peer-to-peer and reputation systems at TU Delft, and has grown into one of the larger blockchain labs in Europe. It has produced several world-first innovations such as a fully scalable blockchain architecture and a decentralized blockchain-regulated market, and it has replaced proof-of-work with trust. The Departments Intelligent Systems and Software Technology The Departments of Intelligent Systems (INSY) and Software Technology (ST) together constitute one of the leading Dutch departments in research and academic education in computer science, employing over 300 people. The departments together are responsible for the curriculum of the bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s programmes in Computer Science as well as the master\u2019s programme in Embedded Systems. The inspiration for its research topics is largely derived from technical ICT problems in industry and society related to cybersecurity, computer graphics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, large-scale distributed processing, embedded systems, programming productivity, and web-based information analysis. Job Description The Delft Blockchain Lab (DBL) of Delft University of Technology invites applicants for a 2-year postdoc position in security aspects of blockchain technology in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science. DBL takes a holistic approach to investigating and developing scalable, robust, privacy-sensitive and secure blockchain systems. Its blockchain research ranges from systems aspects and applications to theoretical and ethical aspects. For this postdoc position, DBL invites applicants with a strong background in security, privacy and/or fundamental aspects of blockchain. The Delft Blockchain Lab is looking for a talented and ambitious researcher whose responsibilities include: Conducting security-oriented blockchain research, including the (co-)supervision of PhD students.

Requirements Applicants must have (or receive soon) an excellent PhD in security and privacy or in fundamental aspects of distributed systems (preferably related to blockchain), the ambition to conduct excellent research, and good communication and social skills.
