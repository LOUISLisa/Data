The company has already processed billions of dollars in volume in its first year of existence and is rapidly scaling and building new products. The company is led by industry veterans from leading companies and institutions in the space. It has raised a very large seed round of funding from top tier investors and is in the process of closing a large series A round of funding. It would be advantageous to join before the series A round is closed. The company will pay up to $200k in salary, plus equity which could be very lucrative. Job Responsibilities: - Leading, mentoring, developing, and growing the engineering team. - Managing 5 engineers on day one, and over the next 3-6 months that number is expected to increase to about 10 engineers. - The job would initially be about 50% people management and 50% hands on. At least 10% coding (you can do more if you want), 20% code reviews, 20% understanding product needs and conducting planning and design and delegation of duties to your engineering team. - The tech stack includes Python, Javascript, AWS, and Kubernetes. - The application is very light on front end; 10% front end and 90% backend. - You would be leading the development of 3-4 product lines in the next 6 months. Qualifications: - Experience managing at least 5 engineers directly for at least 2 years. - Experience with large scale systems. - Strong interest in digital assets, cryptocurrency, and fintech in general. - Experience leading full stack development would be nice, but having only managed backend engineering is fine. Someone who has only had experience managing front end engineers would not be a fit. "
