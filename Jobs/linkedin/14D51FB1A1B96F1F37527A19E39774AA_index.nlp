    "Body": " Job Description As a Embedded Systems Engineer, you will work on the development of our universal operating system for blockchain hardware - and more specifically, the design and development of communication protocols between our drivers and hardware components. We're looking for someone who is excited about low-latency, high-speed systems that are optimized for execution. You will work closely with the Chief Technology Officer, firmware, driver and algorithm team to architect, design, build and ship enterprise products. Responsibilities Design, development and production of auto-tuning intelligence in both drivers or through scripting to optimize clock cycles and power performance for application specific workloads. Optimization of communication paths between various devices. Perform teardowns on various devices and quickly document power communications and pinout reports. Work with disassemblers and debuggers to reverse engineer communication payloads for various mining devices. Build a watchdog protocol within the operating system for basic self-healing. Implement FPGA code for networking and basic system operations in optimized VHDL/Verilog, targeting Xilinx architecture. What We're Looking For We're looking for obsessive curiosity. We are working in an industry where there is a lot of ambiguity and very little documentation - you must be comfortable thinking about challenging problems and setting your own direction. We're looking for someone who has an obsession with optimization: whether it's in terms of instruction sets, clock skew scheduling, or shaving power, you must be constantly thinking about how to push the boundaries of power tradeoffs. We're looking for someone who has an eye for security. You should have a knowledge of basic networking concepts and protocols, network security, low-level computer languages (e.g. assembly), and knowledge of code analysis tools. This is a heavy programming role. You should be comfortable prototyping code, producing code, and shipping code. We're looking for engineers who are passionate about their skills, and are looking to show them off! We're looking for a Rust champion. You should be passionate about the Rust programming language and believe that it is critical for a space that cannot afford memory leaks, race conditions, or bugs. Experience and Competencies Rust - 2+ Years. Embedded FPGA Experience - 4+ Years. VHDL/Verilog. Proficiency in C, C++ (5+ Years) A BS Degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science or Computer Engineering. 6+ Years general engineering experience. 3+ Years enterprise embedded engineering experience. Experience with oscilloscopes, logic analyzers and multimeters for debugging. Comfortable with both algorithms (search, sort, b-trees), and design patterns (factory, observer, singleton). A deep understanding of microprocessor fundamentals (interrupt processing, registers, assembly code). A deep understanding of microcontroller fundamentals (Client, DAC, Timers, PWM, DMA, watchdog). Experience with memory and memory architectures including NOR, NAND, SRAM, DRAM and wear levelling. Experience in x86 assembly, and a knowledge of PC architecture. Comfortable with communication protocols (SPI, I2C) and transmission protocols (UART) and others including LIN, SATA, PCIe, USB, CAN and MOST. Experience with concurrent/parallel programming and asynchronous code. Experience with embedded systems and embedded techniques including debouncing of switches, resistive ladder switchers, rotary encoders, etc. Knowledge and experience with in-circuit emulators and logic analyzers. Experience with product specifications, systems analysis, microprocessor based systems and firmware design. Experience with embedded RTOS & Linux, with 32-bit microprocessor architecture. Strong organizational and documentation skills. Proficient problem-solving skills. Comfortable working with disassemblers and debuggers (IDA Pro, Ghidra), break points, and system analysis techniques. Working knowledge of profilers. An intimate understanding of digital design. Ability to work independently or as part of a team. ",
