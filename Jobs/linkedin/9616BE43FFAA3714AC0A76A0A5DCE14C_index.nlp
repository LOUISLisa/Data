    "Body": " About ZenSports ZenSports is a mobile peer-to-peer sports betting marketplace where anyone can create and accept bets with anyone else in the world, without the need for a centralized bookmaker. Bettors can create their own bets with their own odds and terms, and others in the marketplace will accept those bets. ZenSports has created its own cryptocurrency utility token called SPORTS, which customers can use for placing bets, earning discounted betting fees, and getting cash back, bonuses, and other rewards. Download the app today: iOS and Android. What We\u2019re Looking For Our SPORTS utility token, SPORT security token, and certain API\u2019s are built on the ICON blockchain protocol. We have aggressive plans to build out more API\u2019s and smart contracts on ICON for our sports betting platform. We\u2019re looking for a blockchain engineer that is very familiar (or fluent!) with developing on ICON\u2019s protocol to join us either as a part-time or full-time contractor (preferably full-time). Must have prior blockchain software engineering experience developing on ICON and be able to work autonomously in a dynamic, fast-paced startup. You can work either locally here in San Francisco, or remote. We\u2019re a fun team that is proving out the first real-world use case for cryptocurrencies and blockchain, and we\u2019d love to have you join us in disrupting the centuries-old bookmaker. Responsibilities Lead all of ZenSports\u2019 blockchain software development efforts. This includes being the go-to person for anything and everything related to all of our blockchain development. Learn and become fluent in our existing blockchain smart contracts and API\u2019s: Our existing SPORTS utility token smart contract. Our existing SPORT security token smart contract. Our existing SPORTS utility token deposit API that we use to allow customers to make SPORTS tokens deposits within the ZenSports app. Build out new token/cryptocurrency related smart contracts, as well as new logic-based smart contracts for our sports betting features. Build out new API\u2019s to: Allow our ZenSports app to tap into our smart contracts on ICON\u2019s blockchain. Allow third party developers and partners to tap into our smart contracts on ICON\u2019s blockchain. For open API\u2019s that are built for third party developers, create detailed documentation that makes it seamless and easy to integrate such API\u2019s. Run one-off scripts as needed for things like our SPORT security token dividend payouts. Understand and monitor the ICON Developer Portal for updates and changes. Communicate with all stakeholders effectively via Slack, Asana, and other internal and external communication tools. Effectively communicate to the rest of the leadership and engineering team any blockers, emergencies, or other critical items that may come up. Must Have Skills Strong understanding of how to develop using SCORE, T-Bears, and ICON SDK\u2019s (Nodejs, MongoDB, Redis ). At least 5 years of general software engineering experience, with at least 2 years of blockchain engineering experience. Prior API development experience is a plus. AWS experience preferred but not required. Able to rigorously prioritize, organize, and understand what needs to be accomplished and by when. Being deadline-driven is a must. Must be obsessed with communicating via Slack, Asana (sprint/task management), and Google Calendar. Double that obsession if you\u2019re working remotely outside of San Francisco. Able to represent the brand and company well. Ability to create process documents and get buy-in from others. Passionate with how ZenSports is solving the pain points and problems with traditional sports betting. Understands or is willing to learn very quickly mobile, social, sports betting, and crypto.
