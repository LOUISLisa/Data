    "Body": " Customer Experience (CX) Strategist Our Team We focus on building great customer experiences and reducing friction for our customers, and we believe that every employee has a role to play in delivering this cohesive experience to our customers. In fact, it is in our CX manifesto to enable every employee to deeply understand our customers\u2019 and partners' needs. We are committed to developing a genuine understanding of who they are and what they expect of us, and sharing that knowledge with everyone in the company. If CX does this well, we can create meaningful moments that matter for our customers, ensuring we live up to our brand promise and create customers for life. Your Role Our team looks holistically at our prospects, customers, partners, and internal teams with a CX methodology, collects their \u201cvoices,\u201d maps their journeys, and drives cross-functional initiatives to support customer-centric priorities. That\u2019s a big scope of work and requires both passion and skills. To be effective at how we serve our customers, we must have a team that looks holistically at the journey we are on with our customers and moves the company in the right direction to deliver great CX across every touchpoint in the journey. One example project might be looking at a key touchpoint that our customers and partners have with us, using data and insights (both qualitative and quantitative) to identify opportunities for improvement. This leads to planning a program to drive change across multiple workstreams; coordinating engagement across teams; setting the scope, deadlines and clear accountability for these functions as well as helping guide them to completion. In addition, you will help incorporate and evangelize experience design techniques, embedding best practices to design and implement optimal experiences across the customer journey. You will create journey maps and standard operating procedures across the business to help our organization understand our customers\u2019 needs with opportunities to serve them. You will be diplomatic, agile and assertive to move things in the right direction to complete tasks on time with high quality. You will play a critical role to ideate, plan, pursue, implement, monitor, and build upon new initiatives that deliver customer insights that lead to action for our organization. You will bring proven methods and solutions with you to improve the way we work, how we support our customers and partners, and how we create more operational efficiencies. We are growing quickly, and you can grow right alongside us to make a huge impact, grow your career, and be part of a fast-paced, results-oriented, and customer-centric culture. The ability to create a distinctive customer experience that compellingly reflects our brand promise is a main part of our goals. Will you join us in this mission?
