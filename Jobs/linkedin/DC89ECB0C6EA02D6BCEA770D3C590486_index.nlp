As we look towards the next billion customers, and realizing our vision of creating an open financial system for the world, we\u2019re growing our team to help us build a world-class mobile experience. This is where you come in - we\u2019re hiring iOS, Android, and React Native engineers to help us bridge complex crypto concepts to delightful customer experiences. You\u2019ll build better portfolio tools, launch new financial services, integrate new cryptocurrencies, and expand to new countries. You\u2019ll work closely with our product and design teams to identify what our customers need, and work cross functionally with other engineering and non-engineering teams to get those features out the door.

A little about our team: we\u2019re a tight-knit group with experts in iOS, Android, React Native, design, and product. We have a continuous integration pipeline, desktop build machines to maximize our team\u2019s productivity, and are ruthlessly focused on making our mobile apps easier and safer to build. As you\u2019re thinking about joining us, it may be helpful to know that, there are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we assess whether a candidate demonstrates our values: Clear Communication, Positive Energy, Efficient Execution, and Continuous Learning (read more about our values here). Second, we look for signals that a candidate will thrive in a culture like ours: we default to trust, embrace feedback, celebrate thoughtful failure, and expect sustained high performance. These cultural signposts help us work together as a championship team (read our full culture doc here). Finally, we\u2019re looking for people who are excited about our mission \u2014 building an open financial system for the world, powered by crypto and blockchain. What You'll Be Doing Design improvements to our existing product by thinking from first principles and focusing on our customer\u2019s needs.

Work with engineers, product managers, designers, and senior leadership to turn our vision into a tangible roadmap every quarter. Add positive energy in every meeting or interaction with your coworkers - it\u2019s one of the things that makes Coinbase an extraordinary place to work at.
