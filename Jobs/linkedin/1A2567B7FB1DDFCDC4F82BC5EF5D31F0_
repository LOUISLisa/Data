    "Body": " FPGA Engineer Classification Non-Exempt Reports To Chief Technology Officer Summary As an FPGA Engineer, you will work on the implementation of a baseline design for VDF's on the AWS F1 FPGA platform. You will work closely with the Chief Technology Officer on possible optimizations around crating the lowest latency, 1024-bit modular squaring circuit possible. You will be challenged on both your algorithmic expertise as it applies to things like Montgomery modular multiplication or Barrett's reduction, your hardware expertise as it applies to pipeline optimizations, compression trees, and accumulators, and floorplans. Mission & Vision The problem: let h be the function h(x)=x^(2^t) mod N, where: Input: x is any 1024-bit integer; Modulus: N=124066695684124741398798927404814432744698427125735684128131855064976895337309138910015071214657674309443149407457493434579063840841220334555160125016331040933690674569571217337630239191517205721310197608387239846364360850220896772964978569683229449266819903414117058030106528073928633017118689826625594484331 is fixed; Time Parameter: t=2^30 is fixed; Compute h(x) as fast as possible. The above is what is known as a VDF - a verifiable delay function. VDF's are a low-level building block in cryptography - barely more than a year old. The theory of VDF's go is that they can provide an unbiased proof of randomness - a critical application in blockchain, where randomness helps create fairness and prevents collusion from participants or censorship. We believe VDF's will play a big stake in proof of stake infrastructure - that's why we're dedicating ourselves to the study, implementation and optimization of the VDF on FPGA infrastructure. Join a team that has spent ten years building the backend infrastructure for a multi-billion dollar industry, and be one of the first engineers to define the new standard when it comes to proof of stake infrastructure. We're born of the blockchain, and inspired by AI. Are you ready to make history? Responsibilities Design, development and production of an optimized VDF implementation on the AWS F1 FPGA platform. Documentation of the design, including high-level algorithmic drawings with formulas, pseudo-code, models, and key implementation details, along with detailed instructions to reproduce all inputs and results. What We're Looking For We're looking for someone who has an obsession about optimization. You should be constantly thinking about pipelines in your design, partial product multiplier sizes, lookup tables, compression trees and accumulators, and clock timings. We're looking for someone who has a background in FPGA algorithmic implementation. Experience and Competencies RTL Verilog/VHDL, 2+ Years. Experience with data structures, algorithms, graph traversals. Proficiency in C, C++ (5+ Years) Good knowledge of place and route style optimization algorithms and analytical methods. Performance optimization at all levels, from low-level architecture to algorithm. A BS Degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science or Computer Engineering. Proficient problem-solving skills. An intimate understanding of digital design. Ability to work independently or as part of a team. Supervisory Responsibility This position has no supervisory responsibilities. Work Environment This job operates in a professional office environment. Physical Demands There are no physical demands in this job or role. Position Type/Expected Hours of Work This is a full-time position. Days and hours of work are Monday through Friday, 8:30AM to 5PM. Required Education And Experience Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science or Computer Engineering. Preferred Education And Experience Cryptographic skills are a plus. Other Duties You may be required to collaborate with the Chief Technology Officer on presentations about your role and product, or attend calls with the Chief Technology Officer to speak about the product. Please note that the job description is not designed to cover or contain a comprehensive listing of activities, duties or responsibilities that are required for this job - duties, responsibilities and activities may change at any time with, or without notice. We are a startup, and we're all required to wear many hats. ",
