    "Body": " Background The UN Technology Innovation Labs (UNTIL) are designed to move humanity forward, faster by focusing on the use of innovative technology to solve some of humanity's most pressing needs. Recognizing that innovation plays a critical role in moving the United Nations forward and acknowledging that the United Nations\u2019 ability to innovate and engage in partnerships will be a significant factor in the efforts to successfully implement the SDGs (and the broader mandates of the United Nations), the UNTIL Lab programme is designed to support the journey to review, build, adapt and implement technology solutions to address problems that Member States are facing. To engage the gears of innovation proactively, the United Nations Office of information and Communication Technology (OICT) is establishing \u201cUnited Nations Technology Innovation Labs\u201d (UNTIL). Using cutting-edge frontier technology currently available, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, internet of things, fintech, and the use of drones to answer Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) challenges, UNTIL aims at using technological innovation to resolve day to day issues. In line with the ICT Strategy (A/69/517) approved by the UN General Assembly at its 69th session, OICT is establishing new UNTIL Labs locations in Europe, Africa, and Asia. Labs in other regions are planned for a second implementation phase in response to specific Member State\u2019s host requests. In 2015, the 193 United Nations (UN) the Member States adopted 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The SDGs cover a broad set of challenges such as economic inclusion, diminishing natural resources, geopolitical instability, environmental degradation, and the multi-faceted impacts of climate change. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next 15 years and they define the agenda for inclusive economic growth through to 2030. The rapid advancement of technology in the past decade has changed the way organizations operate. UN General Assembly in its resolution 68/220 [1] recognizes the vital role that science, technology, and innovation, including environmentally sound technologies, can play in the development and in facilitating efforts to address global challenges. To improve on the delivery of UN mandates to create meaningful impact, a programme was designed to leverage on the latest technology and harness global expertise and effort for the development of open source solutions, tools, and services to achieve the SDGs. This unified innovation programme is being piloted in the form of United Nations Technology Innovation Labs (UNTIL), championed by the United Nations Office for Information and Communication and Technologies (UN-OICT). UN-OICT and UNDP have partnered with MaGIC of the Malaysian government to establish a lab at Cyberjaya, Malaysia. The mission of UNTIL Malaysia is to build solutions to needs related to UN mandates, namely in SDGs, for several thematic areas that are central to Malaysia and the region. UNTIL Malaysia aims to bring the right project interventions, global technology, expertise, and network through which and entrepreneurs to work on meaningful development of sustainable solutions. All solutions will be based on open-source standards, will use open data, and will eventually be available to all UN Member States. This specific assignment of Senior Project Consultant is to engage as an expert who will help UNTIL Malaysia to build a technology ecosystem in the country and in the region. He/She will provide technical leadership in the UNTIL Malaysian program and the upcoming projects under the agreed thematic areas. Each UNTIL is based on different humanitarian themes that are central to the needs of each individual Labs specific geolocation. The Labs will use AI, Blockchain, IoT and other high-tech tools to develop technology solutions that will be open source and available globally to all Member States once operational. Duties And Responsibilities The goal of the UN Technology Innovation Labs is to function as a start-up environment and create a platform for collaborative problem solving between UN resources, the Private sector, Academia, and Civil Society. Each Lab will facilitate linking this platform with innovators and mentors from across the globe as well as to facilitate the global exchange of ideas and resources. UNTIL will function as a Laboratory and tool, offering advisory support and guidance that will facilitate problem-solving through hands-on-workshops, immersion-learning, and incubated projects. Each Lab will focus on specific thematic areas of concern to the host country. Themes will not be duplicated to the extent possible in other global Labs, but technology will be shared and transferred creating an ecosystem of innovative technology tools and testbeds for proof of concepts.
