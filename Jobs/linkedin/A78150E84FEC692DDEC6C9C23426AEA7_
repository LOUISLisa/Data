Blockchain & Affordable Housing Intern Program Duration: June 1st - August 1st, 2020 Organization Summary: Our goal is to build modern governance tools using innovative technology to preserve affordable housing in New York City. There are about 1 million affordable housing apartments in New York and everyday there are between 27 to 60 units that are illegally deregulated. The city and the state use a constellation of antiquated systems that make the whole process very inefficient. Tenants, Government agencies and Landlords have little to not trust between each other. More recently the COVID-19 outburst in New York City pushed for government services accessible remotely. We see blockchain as a force for social innovation. We are not crypto traders. Under the hood, LOTB uses a private Ethereum service to safely record and track rent regulated apartments in New York City. We are in the process of being funded and need interns to build the next chapter of the company. Product Managers have an essential responsibility, as he/she/they produce product specifications for engineering. We are looking for: High communication skills, you ask questions, you ask for help, you can translate forms into user stories and technical actionable documents. Exposure or experience in human centered design/design thinking. You are excited to show us the latest tools to communicate with the development team. You understand how the technical objects of a blockchain communicate with one another - Nodes, Validators, Smart Contract, Tokens, etc. A strong curiosity, you love working in a fast paced environment. Bonus points if you have UX/UI skills Responsibilities: Working under the direction of the CEO you will become an expert in the affordable housing process and regulation.

Your experience at LeaseOTB: Build a product used by thousands of tenants, landlords, and regulators for the NYCx Co-Labs: Housing Rights Challenge.
