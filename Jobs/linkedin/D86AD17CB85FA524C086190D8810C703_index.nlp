They should be passionate about learning new products continuously at a technical and troubleshooting layer. Take control to solve tickets- You will be given tickets to answer that are ambiguous.

By contrast, in our group, you will work with a multitude of environments and products and you will WOW customers with your ability to resolve their most ambiguous issues. These issues are not solvable by following a recipe, rather you will be the master chef of resolution You will not work with the product's code (that is for our engineering team) but your customers will love your support because there is no issue that you can't resolve with your scripts, queries and troubleshooting skills.
