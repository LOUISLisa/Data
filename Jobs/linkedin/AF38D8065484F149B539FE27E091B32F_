Writing content (technical and non-technical) to be used for a variety of purposes including but not limited to video scripts, animations, social media posts, website copy, blog posts, interviews, articles, and press releases. Contributing to website content discussions by providing accessible written documentation for a well-defined audience. Engaging with Cosmos ecosystem\u2019s developers and community to collect feedback and reports findings back to the team for continued product improvement. Collecting updates from Cosmos engineering organizations, writing the content, and sending the monthly Engineering newsletter. Absorbing a wide scope of understanding of the entire cryptocurrency/blockchain industry to inform product-market-fit.

Strong comprehension of industry trends and product-market fit. Nice To Have Experience in deploying and maintaining server-side Go applications. Working knowledge of networking and databases. Passion about distributed systems and what cryptocurrency can do for humanity. Ability to explain abstract technical concepts in an easy to understand manner.
