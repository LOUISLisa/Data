    "Body": " The Short & Sweet Summary. Floating Point Group is on a mission to bring institutional-grade services to the digital currency markets. By abstracting away the complexity of interfacing with hundreds of different trading venues (each with their own idiosyncratic technology) while simultaneously pooling liquidity from across these venues, FPG's services enable hedge funds, asset managers, and institutional investors to participate in these nascent markets with unprecedented confidence and efficiency. With digital currency trading volume routinely breaching $100 billion in 24hr trading volume, the need for robust trading infrastructure is more salient than ever. We offer our clients the first consolidated product for ingesting data, achieving best execution, and automated trade settlement in the cryptocurrency markets. We're looking to fill the role of Institutional Sales with a person who has a superb track record of managing long sales & partnership cycles for complex fintech products. You will play a central role in establishing and strengthening key relationships with customers and business partners that will turn into long term recurring revenue. Your mandate will be to both expand our market share in our current verticals as well to ideate & validate new strategic customer segments. What You'll Be Doing. Execute an ambitious go-to-market strategy that will immediately impact our bottom line. You'll work hand-in-hand with the executive suite, our Sales & Trading team, and the product team to deliver a high-demand product to a suite of customer archetypes.

You'll be collaborating both with our current highly diverse team of highly-motivated (and insatiably curious) builders as well as enjoying full access to our advisors, whose prolific careers at some of the world's premier tech organizations and financial institutions have cemented them as invaluable resources to FPG. Learn and grow at a breakneck pace as our company rapidly scales. As an early team member, you will have an incredible degree of autonomy, it's something we intentionally build into our workflow. We expect that you not only take ownership of your work but that you have an appetite for doing so. As our team continues to grow, your responsibilities will inevitably follow suit - the organization is expected to double in size in the next three to six months. Who You Are. You've managed long, complex sales cycles. You have experience maintaining and growing relationships to keep customers hot during long, complex sales cycles. You have a keen sense for the feedback you're getting from prospects to understand their needs and ensure we deliver the correct solution. You've worked on a high-velocity team. You understand how to make sense of a rapidly growing and changing environment, product, and team. Your ability to adopt and grow has distinguished you previously in your career.
