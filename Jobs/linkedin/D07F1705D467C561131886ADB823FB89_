Qualifications The ideal person for this position should have a passion for back-end Development, be strong in Javascript (Node.js), can work collaboratively with others, has a knack for writing reusable code, and embraces TDD, Unit Testing using JS Promise, DevOps, and Automation. You MUST have 3-7+ years of experience, primarily as an engineer working in the back-end and understand the principles of microservice development as well as Node.js. Having experience AWS Lambda, Jest, CircleCI, React and Terraform is great. Strong belief in TDD, DevOps and automating as much as possible. If you have prior experience using JEST or a similar framework for Unit Testing this would be a huge plus. Prior experience with microservices and architecting systems in the cloud. Experience leading a development team would be a huge plus. Ability to break down complex problems into a variety of simple and generic problems. Comfortable with client interaction. Ability to work collaboratively and productively with others.
