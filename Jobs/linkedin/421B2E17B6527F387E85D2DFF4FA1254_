Built by a team featuring engineers and leaders from Google, Apple, Amazon, Stanford and Harvard, Harmony is a fast and secure blockchain with key innovations in state sharding and peer-to-peer networking. Its sharding uses secure proof-of-stake and decentralized randomness, and its networking achieves optimal cross-shard routing and fast block propagation.
