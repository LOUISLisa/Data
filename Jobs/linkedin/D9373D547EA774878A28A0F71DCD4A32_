Our dedicated team has developed a software platform that uses the uniqueness of biometrics to create an identity for the participant that can't be shared, lost or taken \u2013 all common problems in the developing world.??Our customers are mostly NGOs or nonprofits providing services to underserved populations offering healthcare, refugee aid, medical research, or prevention of human-right abuses.??Our identity solution creates trusted identity, allowing the participant to receive services, medical treatment, and in some extreme cases possibly saving their life. ?? We are also developing an entirely new product that will help establish identity at birth using blockchain technology to bypass the traditional barriers to establishing identity.??This product will fill the gap when government-issued birth certificates are not available, either due to lack or resources or ethnic discrimination. ?? iRespond is based out of the Seattle area, and decentralized in our operations. Candidates need to be aware that as is common with many non-profits, iRespond pays approximately 60% of typical market rates. Our team members are self-motivated, respectful, and dedicated to helping others. "
