Blockchain & Affordable Housing Software Engineering - Blockchain Infrastructure Intern Program Duration: June 1st - August 1st, 2020 Organization Summary: Our goal is to build modern governance tools using innovative technology to preserve affordable housing in New York City. There are about 1 million affordable housing apartments in New York and everyday there are between 27 to 60 units that are illegally deregulated. The city and the state use a constellation of antiquated systems that make the whole process very inefficient. Tenants, Government agencies and Landlords have little to not trust between each other. More recently the COVID-19 outburst in New York City pushed for government services accessible remotely. We see blockchain as a force for social innovation. We are not crypto traders. Under the hood, LOTB uses a private Ethereum service to safely record and track rent regulated apartments in New York City. We are in the process of being funded and need interns to build the next chapter of the company.
