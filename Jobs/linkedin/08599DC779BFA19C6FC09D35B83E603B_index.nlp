    "Body": " Microsoft Research provides a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers. Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment. The charter of the Database Group at Microsoft Research Redmond is to increase the usefulness of database system technology to users by creating, extending, and applying database technology. To that end, we consult with product groups at Microsoft and take part in exploratory research projects in several data management systems topics. See our current projects list for an overview of our active research areas (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/database/). The Database group has a long tradition of building systems as part of our research. Several of our projects have contributed major technical innovations to Microsoft products. Examples include the Hekaton main-memory OLTP engine, SQL Server Apollo column storage, and the StreamInsight event processing system. More recently, our group has made several projects open-source, including: FASTER - a concurrent key-value store (https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER), Common Runtime for Applications (CRA) - for building data-flow style, cloud-native applications (https://github.com/Microsoft/CRA), AMBROSIA -- a programming language independent approach for authoring and deploying highly robust distributed applications (https://github.com/microsoft/ambrosia) and a library for Persistent Multi-word Compare-and-Swap for NVRAM (https://github.com/Microsoft/pmwcas). Responsibilities Interns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world\u2019s best researchers, interns learn, collaborate, and network for life. Interns not only advance their own careers, but they also contribute to exciting research and development strides. During the 12-week internship, students are paired with mentors and expected to collaborate with other interns and researchers, present findings, and contribute to the vibrant life of the community. Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer. Database group interns will be part of a world-class research team, where they will have the freedom to exercise their creative abilities to work on cutting-edge research problems in the data management space. Interns work closely with their mentor(s), to define and refine the research problem, implement prototypes and conduct experiments to validate the ideas. With the resulting artifacts, interns will create internal and external impact by contributing to Microsoft Products and by submitting to top conferences, respectively.
