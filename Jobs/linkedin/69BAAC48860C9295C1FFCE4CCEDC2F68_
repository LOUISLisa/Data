    "Body": " Company At 0x Labs , our mission is to create a tokenized world where all value can flow freely. 0x Labs is the parent company of several cutting-edge technologies and initiatives within the crypto space, representing a tight-knit group of teams that work together toward actualizing that mission. In joining us, you'll take part in transforming the way that value is exchanged on a global scale. We're passionate about open-source software and decentralized technology's potential to act as an equalizing force in the world, and our technology is deployed by a wide array of projects at the forefront of internet and economic advancement. Periscope Trading is a special division of 0x Labs. Founded in 2020, we focus on surfacing competitive liquidity into emerging DeFi markets, helping them grow and mature. Periscope typically operates remotely, and team members are always welcome at 0x Labs HQ in San Francisco. Who You Are As Periscope\u2019s first Tech Lead, you\u2019ll notably shape our small team's work culture and practices. You thrive in making order from ambiguity, and you're excited about converging on salient, leading-edge ideas in service of generating pragmatic solutions. You can theorize strategies as well as write code. You're highly motivated to advance our aggressive strategic goals of instigating competitive and consumable DeFi liquidity, critical in broadening the overall Ethereum and DeFi communities \u2014 especially via the 0x tech stack. You're experienced in managing a small and fast-moving team, and yet remain a high-energy, high-output individual contributor. You're comfortable supervising a remote team with 24x7 market exposure. You're organized and goal-driven. You thrive working independently and autonomously, and you value transparency in providing 360-degree visibility to your team. You're comfortable with economic risks and competitive game theory. You are competitive and driven to win. You enjoy experimenting with new problem spaces and sharing your findings, as well as presenting them internally and externally; and you\u2019re skilled at tailoring your language and visualizations accordingly. Working with experimental and cutting-edge technology inspires you. You find the process of solving problems (and learning how to solve problems!) without a known best practice motivating. You\u2019ll Work Closely Alongside Ron Bernstein, CEO of Periscope, long-time trader, and founder/CEO of Paradex \u2014 one of the very first 0x-based \"relayers\" \u2014 which sold to Coinbase in May 2018. DeFi liquidity innovators Henry Harder and Liam Kovatch, who, prior to joining Periscope, dropped out of Columbia University to co-found Paradigm Labs: a venture-backed start-up focused on liquidity infrastructure for decentralized markets. There, they led the development of non-custodial trading (Zaidan) and liquidity (Kosu) systems built on the 0x tech stack. Paradigm also operated Zaidan's War Chest, one of the first 0x staking pools.
