    "Body": " Do you love building enthusiastic and engaged developer communities? Creating vibrant in-person meetups, workshops and hackathons while keeping the momentum going with great online spaces? Are you passionate about globally scaling the most important aspect of the next wave of computing platforms? As a Community and Events Manager at Near, you wear a lot of hats and interface directly with a lot of people. Ultimately, you own both the growth and quality of the NEAR Platform's core community of developers, designers, product people and entrepreneurs. These developers use the platform to build DApps of their own and their most important engagement point is during our in-person events. The role will require substantial community engagement and that magical combination of excellent people skills, a knack for marketing/partnerships and a healthy dose of operational focus. You'll be the architect of unique and engaging events in different cities around the world which showcase NEAR Protocol and help bootstrap local communities. To do this, you'll need to interface with local partners, hop on the occasional flight and just plain hustle. While you'll need to be able to operate autonomously and with initiative, you'll have the support of the rest of our community, marketing and education teams. Key Responsibilities Plan and run regular in-person and online events for developers that help them get to know the platform and bring our team strong exposure both in San Francisco and globally. Be the voice of our community to our internal team so we continue building the right product to serve their needs. Craft and manage the narrative and personality of NEAR to its community via planning, writing and editing content. Keep the momentum of our in-person engagements going via supporting our online communities.
