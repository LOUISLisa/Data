    "Body": " Posted by: Natalie Morrish Natalie Morrish Building the product and engineering teams globally at MakerDAO - The stability of blockchain About Us The Maker Protocol is a smart contract platform on Ethereum that backs and stabilizes the value of the Dai stablecoin through a dynamic system of Vaults, autonomous feedback mechanisms, and appropriately incentivized external actors. It is a decentralized infrastructure without a central operator. It is one of the oldest Ethereum projects built by a very experienced technical team of blockchain developers. The Maker Foundation is tasked with bootstrapping the system to ensure that it can survive as a fully decentralized organization.
