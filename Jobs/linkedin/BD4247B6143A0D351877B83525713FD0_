Blockchain & Affordable Housing Software Engineering - Full Stack Intern Program Duration: June 1st - August 1st, 2020 Organization Summary: Our goal is to build modern governance tools using innovative technology to preserve affordable housing in New York City. There are about 1 million affordable housing apartments in New York and everyday there are between 27 to 60 units that are illegally deregulated. The city and the state use a constellation of antiquated systems that make the whole process very inefficient. Tenants, Government agencies and Landlords have little to not trust between each other. More recently the COVID-19 outburst in New York City pushed for government services accessible remotely. We see blockchain as a force for social innovation. We are not crypto traders. Under the hood, LOTB uses a private Ethereum service to safely record and track rent regulated apartments in New York City.
