In addition, you have contextual analytical skills to identify opportunities for IoT in Shell\u2019s businesses, both at the technical (end-to-end integration) and business level (economics, work-processes). Having experience with technical development in a cloud environment, as well as a degree (Master or PhD) in Computer Science or related areas, will be a strong feature to work with suppliers & start-up companies.
