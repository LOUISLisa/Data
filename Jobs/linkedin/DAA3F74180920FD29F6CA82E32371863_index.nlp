    "Body": " About ZenSports ZenSports is a mobile peer-to-peer sports betting marketplace where anyone can create and accept bets with anyone else in the world, without the need for a centralized bookmaker. Bettors can create their own bets with their own odds and terms, and others in the marketplace will accept those bets. ZenSports has created its own cryptocurrency utility token called SPORTS, which customers can use for placing bets, earning discounted betting fees, and getting cash back, bonuses, and other rewards. Download the app today: iOS and Android. In addition to our direct-to-consumer business, we also recently launched ZenSports for Businesses, which is a new set of enterprise products that we\u2019re selling to large enterprise clients. One of those enterprise products is a set of API\u2019s around our SPORTS token and other cryptocurrency tokens, which gives these enterprise clients the ability to seamlessly integrate cryptocurrencies into their existing payments and rewards systems. What We\u2019re Looking For We are looking to hire an expert Software Engineer that will be responsible for managing all of the company API\u2019s, as well as onboarding new high-touch enterprise clients.

You can work either locally here at our headquarters in San Francisco, or remote. We\u2019re a fun team that is proving out the first real-world use case for cryptocurrencies and blockchain, and we\u2019d love to have you join us in disrupting the centuries-old bookmaker and financial institutions.
