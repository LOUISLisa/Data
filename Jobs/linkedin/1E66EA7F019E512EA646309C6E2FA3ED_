    "Body": " Posted by: Justin Davies Justin Davies Co-Founder and CEO at Reachora and Cerebria Opportunity: Doctors are under incredible pressure \u2013 to deliver extraordinary levels of patient care \u2013 in a field that never stands still. Somehow on top of the long hours the world\u2019s 20million doctors must stay on top of new science, products and techniques \u2013 all the while building their professional profiles and reputations. The old way to do this is reading journals, joining associations and multiple times a year flying around the world to mega-conferences. Reachora is a?better?way. An intelligent community platform where physicians can connect, share and learn in a more efficient, cost-effective and sustainable way. ? Ambition: To build the world\u2019s largest medical community to enhance both the quality of a physician\u2019s life & patient care. To get there we can learn from mistakes already made by consumer social and content platforms, whilst innovating and research ourselves into the specific needs of today\u2019s physicians. Two years old, Reachora is a well-funded and resourced UK & US-based MedTech startup with an impressive leadership line-up. We have just completed a successful and profitable Beta in Cardiology, and are poised for rapid growth, extending our platform and expanding into Oncology and other verticals. ? The Role: This will be Reachora\u2019s 1st Product Manager role and is the first step in bringing design, UX & UI in-house for the first time. We already have a super-capable 5-person development team, who have so far built our sophisticated custom-built backend. But now it\u2019s time to accelerate the frontend and turn our beta video site into a truly market-leading community platform. We are looking for an energetic but rigorous Product Manager to lead the charge.

An additional benefit if you have experience working in the medical or scientific content sphere Experience leading, recruiting and mentoring cross-functional teams Strong history working with data (and knows how to access it) to win debates, make smart choices and drive the team forward Has set up, executed and synthesized ethnographic/qualitative research Strong record of managing stakeholders towards product vision and strategy Has experience in a B2B environment pitching, selling and managing commercial partners ? Your Responsibilities (Things you\u2019ll be doing) Working closely with the company\u2019s leadership team to help shape the product vision Owning the product roadmap and clearly communicating a coherent product strategy You will work closely with a distributed engineering team (in a Product / Scrum Master Capacity) to manage the smooth design and development of features through an agile delivery process You will author detailed and clear business requirements and user stories that can be used to create product specifications as well as technical and architecture requirements Manage prioritization between customer experience, operational capacity, and business priorities Proactively identify and resolve issues that may impair the ability to meet strategic, growth or technical goals Recruit and manage your own internal UX / UI design team Take responsibility for cross-functional teams (internally and externally) in order to deliver on our strategic and growth objectives Derive the necessary insights from analytics in order to inform our decision making Be the voice of the user inside our business Use various research methodologies in order to inform the evolution of our product roadmap and validate the success of our current user experience Develop, deploy and track multivariate testing strategies Move regularly between high-level strategy and detailed product activities Partner with the Product Design team and/or 3rd party partner consultants in order to define and prototype future strategic opportunities Problem-solve and troubleshoot with cross-functional teams inside and outside of the business Engage with our commercial partners and customers to gather requirements, feedback, and strategic objectives in order for us to deliver timely, relevant and commercially successful services ?
