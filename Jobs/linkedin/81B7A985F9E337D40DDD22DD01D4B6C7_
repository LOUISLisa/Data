    "Body": " Description Amazon Quantum Ledger Database, a next generation purpose built database technology was announced in Preview at re:Invent 2018 and is seeing tremendous interest from AWS customers! It is a foundational technology of Amazon's Blockchain strategy and a revolutionary OLTP database with scalable throughput. Join us during this formative period of the product and be a leader in shaping the future of Amazon QLDB as we drive towards General Availability. Amazon QLDB is a fully managed ledger database that provides a transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log \u200eof all application data changes over time. It offers a SQL-like API, flexible document data model and full support for ACID transactions. QLDB eliminates the need for organizations to build ledger-like functionality when their applications require audit-ability and verifiability, such as, when tracking the history of credits and debits in banking applications, verifying data lineage of an insurance claim, or tracing movement of an item in a supply chain network. QLDB is serverless and highly scalable, allowing customers to scale effortlessly to support the demands of their applications.
