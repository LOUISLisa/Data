Contributing to website content discussions by providing accessible written documentation for a well-defined audience. Engaging with Cosmos ecosystem\u2019s developers and community to collect feedback and reports findings back to the team for continued product improvement. Collecting updates from Cosmos engineering organizations, writing the content, and sending the monthly Engineering newsletter. Absorbing a wide scope of understanding of the entire cryptocurrency/blockchain industry to inform product-market-fit.
