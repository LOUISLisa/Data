As a research function, the BRG will seek to understand the current and near-future state of blockchain technologies, their relative advantages and disadvantages, and their applicability to PayPal\u2019s core and adjacent businesses. BRG team members will be expected to gain hands-on knowledge of various blockchain technologies and toolchains and to create clear, timely, and well-researched documentation that expresses a point of view or suggested course of action suitable for presentation to senior management, to board members, partners, or the public. Specific research aims and expected outputs will be set and evaluated on a rolling, 3-6 month basis and used to determine whether to continue, increase, or decrease investment towards a particular goal. In the event that the BRG or senior leadership determines that there are no further relevant research objectives, the BRG may be repurposed for research directed towards other areas. The ideal candidate for the BRG will be a technologist with a strong track record of innovation, with the ability to perform self-directed research, and with excellent verbal and written communication skills. He or she will have experience with prototyping and hypothesis driven development, along with a good understanding of business acumen and how technology applies to business needs and constraints. As much of the research will be open-ended, the ability to self-motivate and drive to results in the absence of specific timelines or deliverables is a must. Prior experience with blockchain technologies is preferred.
