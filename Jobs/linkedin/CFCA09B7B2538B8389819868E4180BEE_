    "Body": " Posted by: Claire Baumann Claire Baumann Director at McKinsey.org *Location flexible: This role can be based in the U.S., Argentina, or Indonesia.* Are you a digital innovation expert eager to work in social and environmental impact and ready to play a leadership role in a startup non-profit? We are hiring a Digital Innovation Lead for McKinsey.org Sustainable Communities, with the initial priority of building solutions for our flagship initiative, Rethinking Recycling. This is a unique opportunity to bring digital solutions to the urgent global issue of recycling and waste management, where technology adoption lags far behind the possibilities in human-centered design, data-driven insights, machine learning, blockchain, and more. ORGANIZATION AND PROGRAM PROFILE McKinsey.org is an independent non-profit founded by McKinsey & Company in January 2018 to have lasting and substantial impact on complex social challenges. Our first initiative, Rethinking Recycling, aims to dramatically improve recycling systems in cities around the world so that they are truly economically sustainable, socially inclusive, and environmentally beneficial \u2013 thus accelerating the transition to a zero-waste, circular economy. We focus particularly on plastics and organics (food and garden waste) in the post-consumer waste stream, which together drive much of the waste pollution crisis and its contribution to local pollution and global climate change. Our program has three major components, aimed at overcoming the vicious cycle of poor supply and inadequate demand for recycled material that plagues most cities today: 1. We improve supply of recyclable waste at the source through better design of behavioral nudges and collection systems. 2. We build community recycling systems that drive cost efficiency and ethical operations in sorting, logistics, and processing of recyclable waste. 3. We work to stabilize recycling demand and unlock better pricing by streamlining and bringing transparency to the full recycling value chain. Our goal is to create a rapidly replicable model for managing waste that cities around the world will adopt. We currently have pilot programs in two locations: Buenos Aires, Argentina and Bali, Indonesia. We have full-time program teams in both locations, as well as community, government, expert NGO, and corporate partners that amplify our impact. In Argentina, on the supply and community side, we have been piloting our proof-ofconcept in an iconic informal settlement in Buenos Aires, Barrio 31, where we have reached higher recycling rates and community engagement than anywhere else in the city. We now aim to complete and hand off the Barrio 31 program to local stakeholders, and to apply our learnings to a full mid-sized city in Argentina. On the demand side, we are engaging multiple industry players to explore mechanisms for channeling purchasing commitments into stabilizing markets for recycled material. Read more about our work and see a video of our program in Argentina on our website: http://www.mckinsey.org.? POSITION DESCRIPTION The Digital Innovation Lead will report to the Global Executive Director of Sustainable Communities, under which Rethinking Recycling is housed. The Digital Innovation Lead will have five primary responsibilities: 1. Define our digital innovation strategy. Working with our global leadership team and program teams on the ground, you will identify the most promising use cases, define hypotheses to test and products to develop, and plan how we will resource teams to deliver (including external vendors and/or partnerships). The strategy will include: a prioritized roadmap of digital initiatives that can be iteratively built and deployed; a plan for back-end infrastructure and front-end products; and a template for reporting results, learnings and implications for where we go next. 2. Identify emerging digital technologies with applicability to recycling. As our resident digital guru, you will be our go-to source of ideas for using technology to transform recycling, leveraging both existing and emerging technologies to innovate within the field \u2013 and to separate buzzword hype from real potential. 3. Explore partnerships with other digital innovators in the recycling space. For every use case we identify, there will be organizations with products already in the works or on the market \u2013 as well as companies that may not be working in recycling yet, but who could bring exciting technical capabilities and experience that we should be working with and learning from. As McKinsey.org, we aim to combine efforts with local partners and other global organization\u2019 wherever possible, rather than reinventing the wheel. You will be responsible for partnering with (or contracting) the right people and organizations to make a distinctive contribution to digital innovation in recycling. 4. Manage our product portfolio, including overseeing project delivery. You will be responsible for ensuring our digital products and projects have the right teams and enough time and resources to deliver according to program needs. This will often involve rapid iteration and field testing with our program teams on the ground and their users/stakeholders. 5. Be a role-model digital leader. As the head of digital innovation in a startup non-profit environment, you will be rolling up your sleeves and doing some of the work yourself, especially in early stages \u2013 for example, building prototypes and supporting technology architecture and development. Just as importantly, you will serve as a role model to your product teams in your passion for getting the job done right, setting the highest standards for quality in human-centered product and engineering. As we are a young and rapidly growing non-profit, there will be opportunities to grow as a digital leader within the organization as we expand our scope beyond Rethinking Recycling \u2013 both in Sustainable Communities and McKinsey.org as a whole. QUALIFICATIONS The ideal candidate will have: ? Deep experience in agile product development, with a spike in designing with human-centered methods strongly desired ? 7+ years\u2019 experience in digital product management, with a proven track record in product strategy, building product teams, and leading the delivery of product to market. Pluses include: \u2013 Experience in a startup (i.e., resource constrained) environment \u2013 Experience in building \u2018ecosystems\u2019 and partnerships with other technology organizations \u2013 Experience working in social impact and emerging economy contexts (e.g., intermittent digital access, indigenous languages), especially building inclusive solutions in partnership with local communities ? Ability to thrive in \u201cbuild the plane as you fly it\u201d environments \u2013 this is an emergent space in recycling globally, especially in emerging economy contexts ? Familiarity with and professional network in topics which will be core to our solutions (e.g., product strategy, agile, design, big data, cloud, and machine learning) ? Ability to tailor communication of complex information to different audiences \u2013 particularly context, main points to understand, implications for strategy/project delivery, asks and next steps ? Strong interest in engaging in societal implications of new technologies and the global discourse on digital policy, especially AI and data (e.g., privacy, impacts on marginalized populations) ? Experience in sustainability topics (e.g., circular economy, corporate social responsibility, economic development) and/or related industries (e.g., fast-moving consumer goods, manufacturing, municipal services/utilities) is a plus but not required? Further details: ? This role can be based in the U.S., Argentina, or Indonesia. U.S.-based candidates must have the right to work in the U.S. as we cannot sponsor work visas. ? We are an equal opportunity employer? TO APPLY Please send a cover letter and CV to jobs@mckinsey.org with the subject?\u201cApplication - Digital Innovation Lead.\u201d ",
