    "Body": " Are you looking for the challenge of scaling a brand new ecosystem from its earliest adopters to reach billions of people while working amidst one of the top teams in the world? We are seeking our Head of Marketing to own the marketing roadmap for building out the developer and entrepreneur ecosystem around the NEAR Protocol. Tactically,** this starts with in-the-trenches hustle to plan dozens of launches around distribution and partnerships as NEAR moves towards MainNet. Strategically,** it requires constructing both a clear and compelling brand and the platform for distributing its message. You will own the marketing roadmap which gets us there and be accountable for its results. Organizationally,** it means building out a team to support these efforts during the transition to a live network when global events, education and consumer usage will dominate adoption. NEAR is a developer platform which requires a B2D2C market fit so early efforts will focus on engaging the developer community through events, content and education. Later efforts will apply these at scale by engaging our global community to help spread the message from the grassroots up. Key prongs will be community engagement and content but the core metrics of protocol adoption and usage are ultimately the most important. This is a very high ownership position and the outcomes are very visible. You will have to wear a lot of hats along the path to building a team while inspiring them with your ability to execute. You will excel if you're a highly communicative leader who has strong experience building growth teams for developer-focused startups, a killer instinct for hacking growth and a strong get-shit-done quotient. To be explicitly clear, this is a position for someone with significant experience in developer-focused startups and not someone who has optimized a career for executing a single channel, who prefers to strategize rather than execute or who is uncomfortable being challenged every day. On the other hand, if you become your best self when you're given a set of difficult mission objectives but an empty canvas on which to paint your way to them, this might be a fit for you. ## Key Requirements A clear track record of world class performance in growth or marketing leadership roles in technical startups. Your background should clearly demonstrate excellence. Blazing intelligence, curiosity and a technical mindset. Demonstrated passion for blockchain and developer ecosystems. Experience building and leading marketing teams in dynamic startup environments, ideally those with a strong developer/community/ecosystem component. ## Get to Know Near Near is building the infrastructure of the decentralized web, including the NEAR Protocol smart contract platform and a variety of supporting tools. NEAR is a scalable blockchain designed to provide the performance and user experience necessary to bridge the gap to mainstream adoption of decentralized applications. Unlike other next generation blockchains, this network has been built from the ground up to be the easiest in the world for both developers and their end users while still providing the scalability necessary to serve those users. ## Working at Near At Near, you have the chance to become an early member of a world-class team with significant upside. The opportunity we are tackling will completely reshape the landscape of the web for decades to come and potentially affect billions of people. We are funded by the top names in the industry and have attracted the best technical minds in the world to create a technology that will directly change the lives of billions of people. This is a performance culture where you'll be working alongside -- and learning from -- other top quality teammates executing at their best. We value boldness, ownership, transparency, curiosity and experimentation. We pay competitively plus we offer all employees full health benefits, daily lunch and a fully stocked office within walking distance of BART in SOMA. If you're excited by the challenge of winning in the fastest moving ecosystem as a member of its best team, this might be a good fit. ",
