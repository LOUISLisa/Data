    "Body": " UNICEF works in some of the world\u2019s toughest places, to reach the world\u2019s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential. Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone. And we never give up. For every child, innovate UNICEF has a 70-year history of innovating for children. We believe that new approaches, partnerships and technologies that support realizing children's rights are critical to improving their lives. The Office of Innovation is a creative, interactive, and agile team in UNICEF. We sit at a unique intersection, where an organization that works on huge global issues meets the startup thinking, the technology, and the partners that turn this energy into scalable solutions. We Do This By UNICEF's Office of Innovation creates opportunities for the world's children by focusing on where new markets can meet their vital needs. Connecting youth communities (or more broadly -- anyone disconnected or under-served) to decision-makers, and to each other, to deliver informed, relevant and sustained programmes that build better, stronger futures for children. Provoking change for children through an entrepreneurial approach -- in a traditionally risk-averse field -- to harness rapidly moving innovations and apply them to serve the needs of all children. Creating new models of partnership that leverage core business values across the public, private and academic sectors in order to deliver fast, and lasting results for children. The Office of Innovation specifically looks to form partnerships around frontier technologies (like drones and UAVs, blockchain, 21st century skills, urban technologies, new banking tools, wearables and sensors, or 3D-Printing) that exist at the intersection of $100 billion business markets and 1 billion person needs and to identify how they can grow and scale profitably and inclusively. With Our Partners, We Focus On Convening And Collaborating On New And Different Solutions, Low- And High-tech, By We're an interdisciplinary team around the world tasked with identifying, prototyping, and scaling new technologies and practices. Looking at the 2-5 year horizon to evaluate emerging and trending technologies and to see how UNICEF can work with the private sector on doing better business while improving essential services for children; Investing in early stage solutions that show great potential to positively impact children in the 0-2 year future including the Venture Fund that invests in open source technology solutions from start-ups based in UNICEF's programme countries; Identifying proven solutions that can be implemented at national scale in multiple countries taking the ideas that help thousands in one country, bringing them to dozens of countries across multiple sectors, and impacting the lives of millions of children.\"\u009d Background On Our Blockchain/crypto Work Blockchain is software made up of records of digital transactions that are grouped together into \"blocks\"\u009d of information and shared securely across computers on a shared network. When a new block is added, it is connected or \"chained\"\u009d to the previous block, making it difficult to change past information. Digital currencies (e.g bitcoin) are famous applications of blockchain technologies, nevertheless, these technologies have promises that go beyond currencies or financial transactions. UNICEF Ventures explores technologies, such as blockchain, with the potential to impact children and young people globally, providing them with information, opportunity and choice. The team sees blockchain technology as having benefits in three main ways: 1) leveraging innovative financing models to distribute resources; 2) increasing the efficiency and transparency of internal processes, and; 3) incentivising and encouraging the creation of open-source digital public goods. The approach to achieving this is by researching and prototyping with both internal and external stakeholders. To understand the technical, social, ethical, and legal challenges of utilising blockchain technologies in our complex and interconnected world - the team is exploring this space with open eyes on practical experimentations of cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and various types of tokens, as well as by supporting learning and training initiatives to build capacity. How can you make a difference? Help us design products, and partnerships around a set of distributed cryptographic applications to make the world better.Build the narrative and collaborations around a new technology, create the methods for accessing this partnership, and work with a dedicated technology team to ensure that product is prototyped and iterated upon quickly. This is a role for someone who has built open-source product before, and taken it to a large number of users. You know about rapid testing, agile development (at least from a product-manager if not pro*ject*- manager point of view). You can tell a story, sell an idea, and comfortable work with a distributed team of nerds to help build out a vision. You understand the difference between ETH and ETC and can communicate it clearly in a tweet. Or a few tweets.You have an understanding of financial markets, exchanges, and smart contracts and (probably) find the term \"fintech\" frustrating. You can see a big picture but are able to help develop the minutiae of a plan, and understand how to adapt your communication style based on the audience you're speaking to. To qualify as an advocate for every child you will have\u2026 An advanced university degree (Master's or higher) in engineering, computer science, business administration or other relevant field. A first University Degree in a relevant field combined with 2 additional years of professional experience may be accepted in lieu of an Advanced University Degree. A minimum of five years of relevant professional experience in technology product development, project and partnership management Technical understanding of decentralized systems and blockchain networks (e.g DLT, Bitcoin and Ethereum, Layer 2 solutions, DApps, and DAOs, and doh's). Piloting and scaling of technology solutions in UNICEF programme countries desired Experience engaging with stakeholders from different backgrounds and coordinating multi stakeholder activities. Demonstrated outstanding analytical and quantitative skills, and the ability to conduct independent research. Experience managing a decentralized team. Demonstrated ability to translate clearly complex issues for a non-technical audience. Familiarity with international development; Developing country work experience and/or familiarity with emergency is considered an asset. Fluency in English is required. Knowledge of another official UN language (Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian or Spanish) or a local language is an asset.
